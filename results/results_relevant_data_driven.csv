Korea confirms additional FMD outbreak<br />SEJONG, March 11 (Yonhap) - An additional outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been confirmed in South Korea, rekindling concerns that the livestock disease may further spread widely, the government said Friday. Pigs at a swine farm in Nonsan in the central region of South Chungcheong Province tested positive for the highly contagious disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. The quarantine authorities have culled some 400 affected animals, and placed a travel ban on animals and vehicles, the ministry added. The latest outbreak came just three days after an infection was confirmed at a nearby farm in Nonsan on Tuesday. The animal disease has been spreading in South Chungcheong Province as two outbreaks of FMD were also confirmed in the neighboring towns of Gongju and Cheonan last month. FMD is a \""List A\"" disease as designated by the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health. Countries that report the disease are barred from exporting meat from all cloven-hoofed animals, such as cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.

While there are reports of casualty among cows due to the disease in some villages in the last two days, the Animal Husbandry department is yet to get the required number of vaccines to control the disease.<br />Against its requirement of 1.60 lakh vaccines for Faridkot district, the Animal Husbandry Department has received 80,000 vaccines to control the disease here. \""Our first priority is to use the vaccine in gaushalas, where the number of cows is quite high, as the FMD is a highly infectious disease, said Gautam Pardhan, Deputy Director, Animal Husbandry Department, Faridkot.<br />Besides the adjoining villages of Faridkot, some dairy farms in the Faridkot town too have reported the outbreak of FMD. Chhinda Sharma, a dairy farm owner on the Arianwala Road, Faridkot, said many of his cows had caught the disease two days back. Two cows of Sarbjit Singh, a farmer in Pakhi Kalan, were affected today. In Pipli village, there are reports of many cows in the grip of the disease.<br />Dr Gautam claimed there might be some sporadic incidents of the disease and the department would start a special campaign to make dairy owners and farmers aware about the disease.<br />Foot-and-mouth disease mainly affects cattle, pigs, sheep and goats. Doctors said once under the attack of the disease, the cattle develop maggots in their legs and ulcers in mouth, thus incapacitating them from eating and standing.<br />People could be infected though skin wounds or oral mucosa by handling diseased cattle stock. The virus can enter human body by drinking the infected milk. However, human infection is mild and not considered a major public health problem, said doctors.<br />Two week back, we had sufficient availability of the vaccine but farmers and dairy owners were not very forthcoming in getting their cattle vaccinated, claimed Dr Gautam. However, some farmers claimed that despite the fact that they got their cattle vaccinated against the disease, some of their cattle got infected.<br />Sources in the Animal Husbandry Department said due to the shortage of funds and infrastructure, the department was is lacking in following the proper procedure of vaccination for animals.<br />The vaccine is supposed to be kept at a low temperature (between 2 and 8 Centigrade) but the departments rarely have functional refrigerators and containers to store and carry the vaccine to farmers.<br />Doctors said to control the disease, beside mass vaccination, movement control, continuous monitoring and education of farmers, the affected animals should be quarantined.<br />All readers are invited to post comments -- responsibly.

0106b67cd4,Bird flu confirmed in a wild bird in Co Antrim - Irish Farmers Journal,"Bird flu confirmed in a wild bird in Co Antrim 23 March 2018 Free<br />The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N6 has been found in a wild bird, a buzzard, in co Antrim on Friday, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA), has confirmed. This is the first positive wild bird avian influenza finding in Northern Ireland this year.The chief veterinary officer for Northern Ireland, Robert Huey said: \""This is the first case of H5N6 in a wild bird in Northern Ireland this season. The finding further emphasises the requirement for all bird keepers to remain vigilant and to critically review their biosecurity measures, for example, feeding and watering birds under cover to help reduce the risk of their poultry coming in contact with wild birds.\""Suspicions\""It is important that flock keepers report early any suspicions of disease,\"" he continued. \""While the risk of an avian influenza incursion in wild birds is now heightened, the risk to poultry remains low. However, it is essential that we take the necessary steps to protect our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.\""I continue to encourage strongly all bird keepers to register their flocks. This will ensure they receive the latest information from the department and also allow them to be contacted in an avian disease outbreak, enabling them to protect their flock at the earliest opportunity. I would also encourage bird keepers to subscribe to the avian influenza text service by simply texting \'BIRDS\' to 67300.\"" AdviceAdvice from the public health agency is that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the food standards agency has confirmed that avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk for consumers.Thoroughly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.

For North Chungcheong and North Jeolla provinces hit directly by the animal disease, the ban will stay until next Monday.<br />The ministry said five cows at a dairy farm in Boeun County, North Chungcheong Province, tested positive for the disease. Another suspected case was reported at a farm in Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province, Monday with the test result expected by today.<br />The authorities in Boeun culled all 195 cattle at the first farm as a preventive measure Sunday.<br />Milk from the virus-infected cows could have already been sold to consumers but the ministry said it would not harm any people drinking it because the virus is killed by heat and stomach acid.<br />Foot-and-mouth disease is an infectious disease that affects animals with cloven hooves, such as cattle, pigs and goats.  <br />The virus causes a high fever for up to six days, then blisters inside the mouth and on the feet.<br />Human infection of foot-and-mouth disease is known to be very rare, except in laboratory accidents. Because the virus is vulnerable to stomach acid, it cannot spread to humans consuming infected meat or dairy products.<br />The outbreak caught authorities by surprise because vaccinations against foot-and-mouth disease are mandatory. The government made so in 2010 in response to a deadly outbreak that saw 3.48 million cattle culled here.<br />Authorities said they were sure Korea was safe from the disease because of its high vaccination rate, at least on record.<br />But the ministry raised speculation about the poor quality of the vaccination products.<br />\""According to records, the farmer conducted vaccinations last October 15. But the lab examination found that antibody formation in the five cattle was below 20 per cent, which is surprisingly low,\"" a ministry official said Monday. It usually takes one week for antibodies to form in full.<br />It is also possible the farmer might have lied about vaccinations. If so, the government will slash the amount of compensation that is usually given to farmers affected by the virus. The authorities said they are continuing their investigation.<br />The latest outbreak has put the government into deeper trouble, as it was criticised recently for its response to a bird flu outbreak. The government culled more than 30 million chickens and ducks across the country as a preventive measure, creating a shortage of eggs in the domestic market.<br />New cases of bird flu continue to be reported here.

33581c3e20,Foot and mouth disease hits four districts in Bugisu region - Kampala Dispatch (satire) (press release) (blog),"Foot and mouth disease hits four districts in Bugisu region -<br />A foot and mouth disease affected cow. Courtesy Photo.There is a confirmed outbreak of the Foot and Mouth disease in four districts in Bugisu Region. The affected districts include Mbale, Manafwa, Namisindwa and Bududa. Dr. Felix Odongo, the Bududa District Veterinary Officer, says the disease was first noticed in Bumasete and Bududa sub counties on Friday last week.<br />He explains that to minimize the spread of the disease to other sub counties the district has banned the movement of livestock and animal products from the affected sub counties to other areas in the district. Dr. Odongo also says they have banned the sale of milk and slaughter of animals in both sub counties.<br />He says they have written to the Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries Ministry for intervention. The Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is an infectious viral disease that attacks hoofed domestic and wild animals. It can be spread by infected animals and their products, vehicles and feeds.<br />FMD causes fever in infected animals followed by blisters, largely in the mouth and feet of cloven-footed animals, such as cattle. \""I advise people not to eat the meat from such animals,\"" Dr. Odongo said. Dr. Denis Okello, the Manafwa and Namisindwa District Veterinary Officer, says the disease was first noticed in the district in September.<br />He said the most affected sub counties in Manafwa district are Mayenze, Bukusu, Buwagogo, Buwabwala and Nakhupa. Dr. Okello so far 15 cases of infected animals from Manafwa district have been reported to his office. In Namisindwa district, so far 70 animals have been reported to be infected by the foot and mouth disease since it broke out last month.<br />The affected sub counties include Bukhabusi, Tsekululu and Mukoto. According to Dr. Okello, most of the farmers are ignorant about the disease and continue eating meat from infected animals. Dr. Michael Wandukwa, the Mbale District Veterinary Officer, also says numerous cases of infected animals have been reported in Namabasa, Nakaloke, Namayoyi, Lwasso, Bukasakya, Bungokho, Mutoto, Bukonde and Busano sub counties.<br />According to Dr. Wandukwa, the first of the foot and mouth disease was reported in May this year. He says they carried out vaccination in the affected sub counties and need to do more. Dr. Wandukwa says one of the challenges they are facing is enforcement, which is very difficult in rural areas.<br />Patrick Wanzala, a resident of Nakaloke Town Council in Mbale district told this publication that his four cows presented with high fever for three days followed by blisters in the mouth and on the feet, which affected their movement.<br />Wanzala says he tried to treat the animal in vain. A retired veterinary officer in Mbale who spoke to this publication on condition of anonymity blames the spread of the disease on the agriculture Ministry for failing to take action when the first cases were reported in May.<br />\""I blame the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries for failing to impose quarantine in Mbale district,\"" he said. He expressed fears that Mbale being on the high way, the Foot and Mouth disease will spread to more districts.<br />The Agriculture Ministry has organised a sensitization meeting for the District Veterinary Officers, which ongoing in Kampala. In 2014, the Agriculture Ministry imposed quarantine in Eastern and North Eastern Uganda districts to contain the spread of FMD.<br />- URN",http://dispatch.ug/2017/10/16/foot-mouth-disease-hits-four-districts-bugisu-region/,Kampala Dispatch,Page not found - Kampala Dispatch,NA,NA,NA,en_US,NA,NA,NA,11,,404,Not Available,"Location(s):['Bugisu', 'Bugisu', 'Bugisu Region', 'Mbale', 'Manafwa', 'Mayenze', 'Bukusu', 'Buwagogo', 'Buwabwala', 'Nakhupa', 'Namisindwa', 'Bukhabusi', 'Namabasa', 'Lwasso', 'Bungokho', 'Mutoto', 'Wanzala', 'Mbale district', 'Mbale', 'Kampala', 'Eastern', 'North Eastern Uganda'],Host(s):['cattle'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[There is a confirmed outbreak of the Foot and Mouth disease in four districts in Bugisu Region., Dr. Okello so far 15 cases of infected animals from Manafwa district have been reported to his office., In Namisindwa district, so far 70 animals have been reported to be infected by the foot and mouth disease since it broke out last month.<br />The affected sub counties include Bukhabusi, Tsekululu and Mukoto., Dr. Michael Wandukwa, the Mbale District Veterinary Officer, also says numerous cases of infected animals have been reported in Namabasa, Nakaloke, Namayoyi, Lwasso, Bukasakya, Bungokho, Mutoto, Bukonde and Busano sub counties.<br />According to Dr. Wandukwa, the first of the foot and mouth disease was reported in May this year., A retired veterinary officer in Mbale who spoke to this publication on condition of anonymity blames the spread of the disease on the agriculture Ministry for failing to take action when the first cases were reported in May.<br />\""I],No. of outbreak Sentences:5",Insufficient Metadata,Kampala Dispatch,8,,"Spatial Entities---['Bugisu', 'Bugisu', 'Bugisu Region', 'Mbale', 'Manafwa', 'Mayenze', 'Bukusu', 'Buwagogo', 'Buwabwala', 'Nakhupa', 'Namisindwa', 'Bukhabusi', 'Namabasa', 'Lwasso', 'Bungokho', 'Mutoto', 'Wanzala', 'Mbale district', 'Mbale', 'Kampala', 'Eastern', 'North Eastern Uganda']","Temporal Entities---['Friday last week.<br', 'May this year', 'three days', '2014']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['cattle'],Agent(s):[]",,0.61

Suspected Foot and Mouth Disease Reported in Eastern Province - KT PRESS 
Foot and Mouth breaks out in Eastern Province. 
Cases of foot and mouth disease has been reported in Nyagatare district, Eastern Province, KT Press can exclusively report. 
Our reporter on ground, Sebasaza Gasana Emmanuel reports 13 cows have been marked with the disease. 
KT Press learnt that the disease was first detected in Marongero area in Ryabega Cell where 13 cows belonged to one farmer named Wilson Rusakuma were put in quarantine as part of curbing the propagation of the disease. 
Rusakuma told KT Press that the infectious disease came from Gabiro area which was recently affected by the disease. 
`` The cows I bought from Gabiro area in September, following the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease might have kept the virus until it resurfaced later on, '' Rusakuma said. 
The disease was reportedly detected last Saturday and Rusakuma informed officials of Rwanda Agriculture Board ( RAB ) to quickly intervene. 
In May, the foot and mouth disease broke out in Gabiro area in Nyagatare District. 
Over 100 cows were quarantined in a bid to stop the spread of the disease. 
Justin Zimurinda, the head of animal husbandry in Eastern Province in RAB said that efforts to curb the disease were hampered by some farmers that didn t get their cattle vaccinated when others were being treated in Gabiro Military barracks. 
Other measures put in place to contain further spread of the disease include halting cattle movement and market operations in the area. 
RAB has established an emergency treatment center in Marongero area to avail animal medical services and immunize them before having access to shared cattle dams. 
Cows from Nyagatare District are ferried in trucks to Kigali City even up to Goma and Bukavu in DRC. 
Statistics released by Nyagatare District authorities show that 500 cattle are sold every week and 60,000 liters of milk are supplied to Inyange Industries. 
In a four month - period starting from May, Rwanda incurred a loss worth $ 10 million due to the foot-mouth disease, Minister of Agriculture told police officers today attending the high council of police at its headquarters based at Kacyiru.",http://ktpress.rw/2017/11/breaking-news-suspected-foot-and-mouth-disease-reported-in-eastern-province/,KT PRESS,UPDATED: Suspected Foot and Mouth Disease Reported in Eastern Province,"Cases of foot and mouth disease has been reported in Nyagatare district, Eastern Province, KT Press can exclusively report.

The government raised the crisis warning system to \""severe\"" and temporarily closed 86 livestock markets around the country. (Yonhap News)<br />Unclear whether vaccine currently in use by the government will stop the spread of the A-type virusDifferent strains of the virus causing foot-and-mouth disease have appeared simultaneously in South Korea for the first time. With a disease confirmed at a fourth farm, the government has elevated its crisis warning system to \""severe,\"" the highest level. <br />According to sources from the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs on Feb. 9, the strain of the virus found at the dairy farm in Yeoncheon County, Gyeonggi Province, is the A-type. There are seven strains of the foot-and-mouth virus: O, A, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3. There have been eight outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in South Korea since 2000, but the A-type virus was only found in an outbreak of six cases at cattle farms in Pocheon and Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province, in Jan. 2010. The other seven outbreaks all involved the O-type strain. <br />The problem is that it\'s unclear whether the foot-and-mouth disease vaccine that the government currently possesses will stop the A-type virus in this outbreak. With the virus spreading around the country, vaccination is the most important form of disease control. Livestock at farms have been inoculated with an O+A vaccine that is supposed to be effective against both strands of the virus. But even with the A-type vaccine, its efficacy varies with the specific genotype of the virus. <br />\""It will probably take a couple more days to determine if our current vaccine is effective,\"" said a source at the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Since supplies of the O+A vaccine were inadequate to inoculate the entire livestock population, the government has been using the O-type vaccine in a total vaccination program that began on Feb. 8. It will take at least a week to import more of the O+A vaccine. <br />There has also been a fourth case of foot-and-mouth disease. After a suspicious report was made from a beef farm located just 1.3 km from the dairy farm where the first case of foot-and-mouth disease occurred, a simple test came back positive. The farm is raising 151 beef cattle. <br />During a meeting of the cattle disease control board on Feb. 10, the Agriculture Ministry raised its crisis warning system to \""severe\"", the first time to do so since 2010, during the most deadly outbreak of the disease. 86 livestock markets around the country were temporarily closed on Feb. 9 and will remain so until Feb. 18.

32d258279d,Bluetongue virus found in dairy heifers - Country News (blog),"Bluetongue virus found in dairy heifers<br />Bluetongue virus has been detected in seven dairy heifers near Echuca, forcing authorities to establish a 50km designated virus zone as they determine the source. The virus was detected in three 12-month-old heifers near Echuca on October 14 during pre-export testing, before a further four heifers were found to be affected at the property. The detection of antibodies in the heifers\' blood indicates previous exposure to BTV, with one heifer believed to have been exposed to the virus in NSW where it is more prevalent. The cattle were not showing signs of clinical bluetongue disease and no virus was detected in the animals\' blood. A zone of possible transmission of 50km has been established and a further buffer zone of 50km of detection established around the property while surveillance activities are undertaken, and these will remain in place for a total of 30 days from the date of detection. Victoria\'s chief veterinary officer Charles Milne said it was an \'\'unusual\'\' situation that Agriculture Victoria would continue to monitor. \'\'What we\'ve detected is evidence of past infection and we\'re undertaking an intensive surveillance of 50km around the farm to ascertain if there\'s been any spread and how it came to be within that area,\'\' Dr Milne said. \'\'There\'s no movement restrictions from farms that have been affected. The purpose is entirely to satisfy export partners who require these animals to be free of viruses. \'\'Agriculture Victoria staff will be contacting producers in the area to seek their assistance and make arrangements for on-farm sampling of cattle. \'\'We would ask the farming community to co-operate with the exercise so we can rapidly understand how the animals came in contact with the virus.\'\' Rochester Veterinary Practice\'s Mitch Crawford said there was no cause for alarm at the announcement. \'\'The first thing is: don\'t panic, because it doesn\'t cause any disease in Australia as far as we know,\'\' Dr Crawford said. \'\'(The virus) does exist in northern Australia, and that provides some trade restrictions, but the virus is transmitted from cow to cow by biting insects that to our knowledge are not in Victoria.\'\' The viral disease is spread through flying insects called midges and affects ruminants including cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo and deer. Clinical bluetongue disease has not been recorded in any livestock species in the field in Australia, with the exception of two minor incidents in sheep in Darwin in 1989 and 2001. Dr Milne said there was no risk to humans from BTV, nor was there any food safety issue associated with livestock products. <br />By Alana Christensen[1] on October 24, 2017 <br />References^ Alana Christensen (news.google.com)",http://www.countrynews.com.au/2017/10/24/6806/bluetongue-virus-found-in-dairy-heifers,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en-US,NA,NA,NA,9,,404,Not Available,"Location(s):['Echuca', 'there\\', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Australia'],Host(s):['cattle', 'goats', 'humans'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[\'\'What we\'ve detected is evidence of past infection and we\'re undertaking an intensive surveillance of 50km around the farm to ascertain if there\'s been any spread and how it came to be within that area,\'\' Dr Milne said.],No. of outbreak Sentences:1",Insufficient Metadata,NA,6,,"Spatial Entities---['Echuca', 'there\\', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Australia']","Temporal Entities---['12-month-old', 'October 14', '30 days', '1989', '2001', 'October 24, 2017']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['cattle', 'goats', 'humans'],Agent(s):[]",,0.48

13fe0c116f,EHD virus confirmed in Ohio deer and cattle | Ohio Ag Net | Ohio\'s ... - Ohio\'s Country Journal and Ohio Ag Net,"EHD virus confirmed in Ohio deer and cattle | Ohio Ag Net<br />The first confirmed case of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) was recently announced in both white-tailed deer and cattle in Ohio. The virus was diagnosed by the Ohio Department of Agriculture\'s (ODA) Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL).<br />The positive diagnoses were from a cow from Jefferson County and a wild white-tailed deer buck from Lorain County. The discovery is not unusual, as cases of this infection have been detected in both wild and captive white-tailed deer in Ohio in the summer and fall of each of the last several years. In fact, significant disease outbreaks in Ohio have occurred every five years, the last in 2012. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Division of Wildlife (DOW) reports numerous dead deer from Columbiana and Jefferson counties. EHD virus has also been confirmed in neighboring counties of both Pennsylvania and Kentucky.<br />The EHD virus is not infectious to people and is not spread from animal to animal. It is transmitted by the bite of small midges, so infections are often seen in Ohio in late summer and early fall. EHD-associated deaths can occur up through the first frost of the year. Once infected, deer show symptoms within five to ten days and many deer die within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms. People should always avoid touching or handling sick or dead wild animals.<br />White-tailed deer, along with mule deer, elk, bighorn sheep and pronghorn antelope are susceptible to the disease. Deer infected with this virus may show symptoms including lethargy, head hung down, loss of fear of humans, swelling of the tongue and head and neck, difficulty breathing and excess salivation due to tongue swelling or ulcers in the mouth. Affected deer are often found in or near bodies of water, likely due to fever and dehydration.<br />Cattle may show signs including swelling of the muzzle, oral erosions, salivation, off feed condition and fever. Affected cattle and sheep may also show signs as described for deer as described above. Such cases in cattle and sheep may mimic other reportable diseases such as foot and mouth disease, bluetongue and vesicular stomatitis. Producers and animal owners are strongly encouraged to report such cases to their veterinarian.<br />Veterinarians have been alerted about the confirmed tests and should report suspect cases in livestock to ODA at 614-728-6220. Sightings of sick or dead deer should be directed to the ODNR-DOW at 1-800-WILDLIFE.",http://ocj.com/2017/08/ehd-virus-confirmed-in-ohio-deer-and-cattle/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,,403,Restricted,"Location(s):['Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Jefferson County', 'Lorain County', 'Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Pennsylvania', 'Ohio', 'elk'],Host(s):['cattle', 'humans'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[EHD virus confirmed in Ohio deer and cattle | Ohio Ag Net | Ohio\'s ... - Ohio\'s Country Journal and Ohio Ag Net., EHD virus confirmed in Ohio deer and cattle | Ohio Ag Net<br />The first confirmed case of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) was recently announced in both white-tailed deer and cattle in Ohio., The virus was diagnosed by the Ohio Department of Agriculture\'s (ODA) Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL).<br />The positive diagnoses were from a cow from Jefferson County and a wild white-tailed deer buck from Lorain County., The discovery is not unusual, as cases of this infection have been detected in both wild and captive white-tailed deer in Ohio in the summer and fall of each of the last several years.,  The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Division of Wildlife (DOW) reports numerous dead deer from Columbiana and Jefferson counties., EHD virus has also been confirmed in neighboring counties of both Pennsylvania and Kentucky.<br />The, It is transmitted by the bite of small midges, so infections are often seen in Ohio in late summer and early fall.,  EHD-associated deaths can occur up through the first frost of the year., Once infected, deer show symptoms within five to ten days and many deer die within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms., Deer infected with this virus may show symptoms including lethargy, head hung down, loss of fear of humans, swelling of the tongue and head and neck, difficulty breathing and excess salivation due to tongue swelling or ulcers in the mouth., Such cases in cattle and sheep may mimic other reportable diseases such as foot and mouth disease, bluetongue and vesicular stomatitis., Producers and animal owners are strongly encouraged to report such cases to their veterinarian.<br />Veterinarians have been alerted about the confirmed tests and should report suspect cases in livestock to ODA at 614-728-6220.],No. of outbreak Sentences:12",Insufficient Metadata,NA,8,,"Spatial Entities---['Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Jefferson County', 'Lorain County', 'Ohio', 'Ohio', 'Pennsylvania', 'Ohio', 'elk']","Temporal Entities---['the summer', 'the last several years', 'every five years', '2012', 'late summer', 'the year', 'five to ten days']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['cattle', 'humans'],Agent(s):[]",,0.52

It is the first time that the nation has confirmed a swine FMD case with the rare virus type.It is the first time that the highly infectious animal disease has been detected at a pig farm since the last case in South Chungcheong Province two years ago, with several cases taking place at cow farms in the central region in February 2017.A total of 87 A-type FMD cases took place from 2010-2016, and only three pigs were infected with the strain, according to the ministry.FMD is an acute infectious viral disease of livestock causing fever followed by the development of vesicles chiefly in the mouth and on the feet. It is one of the most infectious diseases for livestock and can spreads rapidly if uncontrolled.It affects cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, buffalo, camels, sheep, goats, deer and pigs, and is prevalent in springtime.

The disease spreads very quickly if not controlled. The severe symptoms include fever; blisters in the mouth, feet and teats; drastic drop in milk production; weight and appetite loss; quivering lips; frothing in the mouth; and even lameness.The disease, which has gripped the state in panic, has already claimed the lives of 10 cattle and forcing the state government to shut down two `goshalas\' to contain the spread of the disease, that is also threatening to affect the state\'s milk production.The situation is compounded by complaints pouring in from members of the farming community over quality and dependability of vaccines supplied to check the spread of FMD even as the disease is rampantly being diagnosed among already vaccinated cattle.Prompted by the newfound threat, the animal husbandry department has not only decided to compensate the death of livestock due to the disease across all its `goshalas\', but has also promised to commission a team of experts to ascertain the quality of FMD vaccines besides posting a veterinarian at each `goshala\' to monitor the health of the cattle.The state government, which was completely engrossed in arranging for fodder for the thriving cattle population, was alerted about the FMD outbreak by various dairy units of Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF).Dairy units in Kolar, Chikkaballapura, Hassan, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar reported FMD cases and brought that to the notice of the animal husbandry department.In a swift move, samples were sent to the Animal Diseases Surveillance (ADS) wing of the veterinary department at Hebbal, which also confirmed the FMD outbreak.According to a copy of the report submitted to the government by the ADS wing, as many as 11 districts reported FMD outbreak.\""The disease has spread across Karnataka, especially in South Interior Karnataka . The highest incidence is seen in Chikkaballapura district in five out of six taluks followed by four taluks of Kolar and three taluks of Ramanagara and Bengaluru Rural...,\"" the report said.A farmer leader from Kolar attributed the outbreak to poor quality of FMD vaccines. \""The FMD has been detected even in those cattle which have been previously vaccinated.

FMD, a viral disease of cattle and swine has spread on the outskirts of Tamil Nadu\'s Tiruvallur district. The disease affects cloven-hoofed animals (those with divided hoofs), including cattle, buffalo, camels, sheep, goats, deer and pigs. It was reported that the cattle tried to contact the concerned department authorities, but the officials have not responded so far.<br />The cattle raising is the main occupation of most of the people of Karani village. The village has over 500 cattle.

c2edb86f79,ASF the UK pig industry\'s biggest exotic disease concern ? APHA - Pig World,"ASF the UK pig industry\'s biggest exotic disease concern - APHA<br />The risk of African Swine Fever (ASF) entering the UK pig population has been identified as number one concern for the industry when it comes to exotic diseases, by the Animal and Plant Health Agency\'s (APHA) pig specialists.<br />ASF was discovered in the Czech Republic in June and more than 60 cases are now reported to have been confirmed, all in wild boar in the Zlin region in the east of the country. Control measures, including 10km control zones have been put in place, alongside efforts to control wild boar numbers.<br />ASF, which has never occurred in the UK, has been regularly found in wild boar in several eastern EU member states since 2014, and longer in Russia and Ukraine.<br />Speaking to Pig World, Dr Susanna Williamson, pig veterinary lead at APHA\'s disease surveillance unit, said an ASF outbreak would be \'hugely damaging\' to the UK pig industry and is urging producers to take all necessary precautions, particularly when it comes to feeding pigs. \""ASF is the main notifiable pig disease that we are concerned about,\"" she said.<br />She said the Czech Republic cases represented a \'significant geographic jump\' further west.<br />\""ASF is in Eastern Europe and there is a focus of infection there in wild boar, which is spilling over into domestic pigs,\' she said.<br />\""In the past few weeks is there have been wild boar found dead due to African Swine Fever in the Czech Republic and that means it has moved further west.

Initial tests revealed involvement of H5 avian influenza, with tests at Bangladesh\'s national reference lab confirming the H5N1 subtype yesterday.According to information reported yesterday to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), 40 crows died. The detection is Bangladesh\'s first since June 2014. However, the virus is thought to be still circulating there. A 60-year-old man who was infected with the virus last October was said to have had contact with live poultry before he got sick, according to a Jan 20 update from the World Health Organization (WHO).Latest French outbreak involved H5N1France\'s latest outbreak was detected at a hatchery in Landes department during ongoing avian flu surveillance, according to a report yesterday to the OIE.

Follow-up tests at France\'s national reference lab confirmed the H5N2 subtype.The 2,200 susceptible birds at the facility will be destroyed.The pace of avian flu outbreaks in France has slowed, but sporadic ones continue to be reported, such as one affecting a broiler farm in Pyrenees-Atlantique department reported to the OIE on Feb 9. The French outbreaks, which now total 71, have also involved H5N1 and H5N9.H5N1 strikes two more Nigerian farmsElsewhere, Nigeria\'s agriculture ministry reported two more H5N1 outbreaks at egg farms, one in Zamfara state in the country\'s northwestern corner and the other in Plateau state, in the central region, according to an OIE notification yesterday.Of 24,884 susceptible chickens, the virus killed 3,635, and the remaining ones were destroyed to curb spread of the virus. The OIE report said the source of the outbreak isn\'t known, but it noted poor farm biosecurity at the locations, a feature of many of Nigeria\'s recent outbreaks.Nigeria is one of a few African countries, alongside Ghana and Cote d\'Ivoire, that have reported a reoccurrence of H5N1 outbreaks after a several-year hiatus.More H5N6 in VietnamVietnam\'s agriculture ministry today reported an H5N6 outbreak affecting backyard poultry in Nghe An province, located in the north central part of the country. The virus killed 415 of 3,030 birds in the village, and authorities culled the remaining ones as a control measure.The country is one of four that have reported H5N6 outbreaks and has been battling the virus since last summer.

But it is time for government to seek international assistance and nip this in the bud because if it spreads, it will be hard to build on the poultry numbers we have now.<br />\""So far, there has not been a major impact on the stock feed companies but if it continues, we might see producers laying off workers and affect production,\"" he added.<br />Irvine\'s referred this paper to the veterinary services.<br />The Department of Livestock and Veterinary Services said Lanark Farm, which belongs to Irvine\'s, was the only farm that had been affected.<br />\""Every effort is being made to prevent infection from escaping the establishment.  The disease had initially been detected and confirmed on 24 May 2017 and the situation had stabilised following complete depopulation of affected poultry sites by 1st June 2017.<br />\""The farm had been in quarantine under veterinary supervision since then and will now remain in quarantine for three months or until the disease is completely resolved,\"" the department said in a statement last week.<br />\""The department is maintaining heightened countrywide clinical and serological surveillance in all commercial poultry production farms, live poultry markets and areas close to big water bodies.

c0d4a31f6f,Bird flu reaches another Tennessee chicken farm linked to Tyson - Twin Falls Times-News,"Bird flu reaches another Tennessee chicken farm linked to Tyson | Southern Idaho Agriculture News<br />A second case of bird flu in Tennessee has been reported at a chicken farm, heightening the threat of the disease in the Southeast, the country\'s biggest poultry region.Highly-pathogenic avian influenza, which can be fatal to domesticated poultry, was found at a commercial chicken-breeder farm in Lincoln County, Tenn., the state\'s agriculture department said Thursday in a statement. The case comes after a chicken farm that was less than 2 miles away had reported the deadly virus in early March, the first incident in the U.S. in more than a year. Both farms were contracted with Tyson Foods, according to spokesman Worth Sparkman.\""Given the close proximity of the two premises, this is not unexpected,\"" Tennessee state veterinarian Charles Hatcher said in the statement. \""We will continue to execute our plan, working quickly to prevent the virus from spreading further.\""<br />While countries across Europe and Asia are also battling with bird flu outbreaks, Brazil, the world\'s leading chicken exporter, has remained free of the disease. BRF SA, the country\'s largest chicken exporting company, had the biggest intraday gain in eight days after the news of the second Tennessee case.The affected flock had 55,000 chickens, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture statement. The farm has been quarantined, and the birds will be destroyed to prevent the disease\'s spread.

bfac35341d,Bluetongue disease confirmed in northwestern SD - Newscenter1.tv,"Bluetongue disease confirmed in northwestern SD<br />PIERRE, S.D. - South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks (GFP) has documented the first deer mortalities in 2017 due to hemorrhagic disease, also known as epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) or bluetongue. EHD was recently confirmed by laboratory analysis in a white-tailed deer in eastern Harding County and a white-tailed deer in western Butte County.This disease is common in white-tailed deer and is typically detected in late summer or early fall. Minor deer losses to EHD can occur in any given year in South Dakota, but weather and habitat conditions will dictate the severity of the disease. EHD is not infectious to humans.The virus is spread by a biting midge and causes extensive internal hemorrhaging. Many deer exhibit no clinical signs and appear perfectly healthy, while others may have symptoms such as respiratory distress, fever and swelling of the tongue. With highly virulent strains of the virus, deer can be dead within one to three days. Affected deer are often found near low lying areas or water, likely due to the deer attempting to combat the high fever.GFP asks anyone who observes sick deer or finds several dead deer in a localized area to contact their local conservation officer or GFP office. This information is valuable to wildlife managers in monitoring deer populations across the state.EHD outbreaks can be locally severe, but rarely affect a high proportion of the deer population. In 2016, however, the disease did affect deer populations in certain areas of eastern South Dakota, and license adjustments were made in some hunting units to react to these unforeseen mortality events. Deer can continue to succumb to this disease until a hard freeze reduces midge populations.For more information on the EHD virus, click here[1]. Information from South Dakota Game, Fish and ParksReferences^ here (gfp.sd.gov)",http://www.newscenter1.tv/story/36306256/bluetongue-disease-confirmed-in-northwestern-sd,NewsCenter1.tv,newscenter1.tv,"NewsCenter1 Media Group covers local news, sports, weather and things to do for the Black Hills of South Dakota, as well as state and national coverage.",https://www.newscenter1.tv/story/36306256/bluetongue-disease-confirmed-in-northwestern-sd/,website,en,NA,NA,"News, Sports, Weather, Things to do, Rapid City Weather, Rapid City News, Rapid City Things to do, South Dakota News, South Dakota Weather",14,0.875,451,Accessible,"Location(s):['SD - Newscenter1.tv', 'Harding County', 'western Butte County', 'South Dakota', 'South Dakota', 'South Dakota Game'],Host(s):['humans'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Bluetongue disease confirmed in northwestern SD - Newscenter1.tv., Bluetongue disease confirmed in northwestern SD<br />PIERRE, S.D. - South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks (GFP) has documented the first deer mortalities in 2017 due to hemorrhagic disease, also known as epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) or bluetongue., EHD was recently confirmed by laboratory analysis in a white-tailed deer in eastern Harding County and a white-tailed deer in western Butte County.],No. of outbreak Sentences:3",Sufficient Metadata,NewsCenter1.tv,11,0.611111111,"Spatial Entities---['SD - Newscenter1.tv', 'Harding County', 'western Butte County', 'South Dakota', 'South Dakota', 'South Dakota Game']","Temporal Entities---['2017', 'late summer', 'any given year', '2016']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['humans'],Agent(s):[]",0.71,0.83

Georgia\'s Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed 68 animals have been infected, with 35 euthanised so far.Sheep and goat accounts for 23% of Georgia\'s livestock export vertical and is estimated to be worth around GEL34.8m ($13.9m), according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC).Georgia, which straddles Europe and Asia, exports the majority of its sheep meat to its comparatively richer neighbour Azerbaijan, which imports around 86% of Georgia\'s sheep. Jordan is another significant importer of Georgian sheep, accounting for 13% of trade in the sector, according a 2013 study by the OEC.Georgia\'s Ministry of Agriculture was unavailable to comment on the impact the outbreak would have on trade.<br />What is Bluetongue?<br />Bluetongue (or BTV) is a non-contagious, viral disease that impacts ruminants - mammals, especially sheep, that acquire nutrients from plant-based foods by fermenting it in a special part of the stomach before it is digested. BTV has an especially high mortality rate for sheep, and less so with cattle, deer and goats.

This farm includes an additional three barns housing 10,000 birds each, all of which have tested negative.<br />MBAH emphasized that this is not the same virus that was the cause of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in the Midwest in 2015.<br />H5N2 LPAI does not pose a risk to the public, and there is no food safety concern for consumers.<br />MBAH said it is working with all federal, state and industry partners to prevent the spread of the disease. Poultry producers are asked to maintain strong biosecurity practices at their facilities to isolate their flocks from outside sources of infection.<br />Tracheal swab samples were collected from turkeys and submitted to the Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory in Willmar, Minn. Tests identified the virus as an H5 influenza strain. MBAH quarantined the flock and sent samples to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. The NVSL confirmed the presence of H5N2 LPAI virus of North American origin on Oct. 20.<br />MBAH said it has increased observation of the quarantined flock, watching for any signs of disease and has increased surveillance of commercial poultry operations within 10 km of the positive flock, all with negative test results. At this time, the affected flock is not showing signs of illness or mortality. The birds will be quarantined until they test negative for disease, at which time they will be controlled marketed.<br />California update<br />Meanwhile in California, a commercial turkey flock in Stanislaus County, Cal., experiencing some increase in mortality and respiratory symptoms submitted samples in early October to the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory.<br />According to the California Department of Food & Agriculture (CDFA), the laboratory reported presumptive positive for H7 avian influenza on Oct. 9, and it was confirmed by NVSL as LPAI H7N3 on Oct. 11.

2b85de2f3a,Netherlands confirms highly pathogenic bird flu outbreak: OIE - Reuters,"Netherlands confirms highly pathogenic bird flu outbreak: OIE<br />PARIS (Reuters) - The Netherlands confirmed an outbreak of highly contagious bird flu in the Flevoland province that led to the culling of nearly 16,000 ducks, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Monday. The highly pathogenic H5N6 strain was discovered on a duck fattening farm in Biddinghuizen on Dec. 7 where it killed 40 birds, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a report posted on the OIE website. A 3-kilometre surveillance zone and a 10-kilometre protection zone were established around the farm, it said. The ministry added that the H5N6 sub-type found in Flevoland was not linked to the Asian zoonotic H5N6 which has been found in South Korea, Japan and elsewhere in Asia, prompting mass cullings. On the other hand it was linked to the H5N8 virus, which last winter had led to the death or killing of millions of birds in an outbreak in western Europe and has been found in Italy and Germany in October.

a2060a35cc,Swine Fever Kills 400 Pigs In Ashanti Region - Peace FM Online,"Swine Fever Kills 400 Pigs In Ashanti Region | Health<br />The Ashanti Region has recorded an outbreak of African swine fever in three districts, which has led to the killing of over 400 pigs between May and June this year.According to the Veterinary Services Department of the region, the affected communities are Adjaman and Amakom in the Bosomtwe District, Hemang near Santasi in the Atwima Nwabiagya District and Tepa in the Ahafo Ano North District.As a result of the disease outbreak, the movement, slaughtering of pigs and its products to and from the affected communities have been banned as a measure to control and curtail the spread of the swine fever which is caused by a virus that produced syndromes from acute to chronic.African swine fever is a disease which affects only pigs and is highly contagious. It is characterised by a high fever haemorrhages and cyanosis in the skin, loss of appetite and a high mortality rate and there is no vaccine against the disease.The disease is mainly transmitted through the movement of infected animals that show symptoms of the disease and the feeding of infected material to pigs.The Chairman of the Pig Farmers\' Association in Atwima Nwabiagya District, Augustine Naah, said the disease outbreak which also occurred last year crippled their business.He stated that they were not compensated for the killing of their pigs as happened in previous years, where farmers were given something to start their business.He appealed to the government to come to their aid to enable them to start over their business. Dr Effah appealed to all pig farmers, livestock traders, butchers, meat processors, shop owners and the public to co-operate with them in its efforts to control the disease.Mr Naah called on all pig farmers in the region to report immediately the presence of any strange disease among their pigs to the nearest office of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) in their area.The Director General of NADMO, Nana Agyemang Prempeh, was concerned about the numerous outbreaks in the country in recent times. He reiterated their commitment to helping find lasting solutions to the disease to enable farmers to go about their business.Nana Prempeh, however, assured them of government\'s support to eradicate the disease and prevent further spread.Last year, the disease hit the Ashanti Region and over 6,000 pigs were killed, something that affected the pig business and livelihood of over 21 pig farmers in the region. Officials from the National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO) and the Ashanti Regional Director of the Veterinary Service Department have inspected some pig farms in the region to assess the situation.",http://www.peacefmonline.com/pages/local/health/201707/319343.php,Peacefmonline.com - Ghana news,Swine Fever Kills 400 Pigs In Ashanti Region,Swine Fever Kills 400 Pigs In Ashanti Region,https://www.peacefmonline.com/pages/local/health/201707/319343.php,article,en_GB,NA,NA,"Health, Articles,Features, Health, Technology, Education, Travel,Tourism, Foreign News, PEACE FM NEWS, Social, Religion, Science & Environment, Crime, EDITORIAL, Speeches, Meet The Press, Announcements, Press Release, Rumour Mill ",14,0.875,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['the Bosomtwe District', 'Santasi', 'the Atwima Nwabiagya District and Tepa', 'Atwima Nwabiagya District', 'the Ashanti Region'],Host(s):['Pigs', 'Pig'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Mr Naah called on all pig farmers in the region to report immediately the presence of any strange disease among their pigs to the nearest office of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) in their area., Last year, the disease hit the Ashanti Region and over 6,000 pigs were killed, something that affected the pig business and livelihood of over 21 pig farmers in the region.],No. of outbreak Sentences:2",Sufficient Metadata,Peacefmonline.com - Ghana news,11,0.611111111,"Spatial Entities---['the Bosomtwe District', 'Santasi', 'the Atwima Nwabiagya District and Tepa', 'Atwima Nwabiagya District', 'the Ashanti Region']","Temporal Entities---['May and June this year', 'last year', 'previous years']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['Pigs', 'Pig'],Agent(s):[]",0.59,0.83
ca373aea08,"ASF update: Virus detected around Warsaw, Poland - Pig Progress (blog)","ASF update: Virus detected around Warsaw, Poland<br />In Poland as well, African Swine Fever is creeping west bit by bit. In recent months, the virus has also affected dead wild boars in the area around Warsaw as well as in northern Poland.<br />Until roughly September 2017, African Swine Fever had predominantly been contained to the border areas with Belarus, in the Podlasie, Mazovia and Lublin provinces. The approach was to contain the virus in these zones in the east of the country.<br />African Swine Fever creeping west<br />Recent developments, however, show that this containment was broken.<br />Most prominently - and rather unexpectedly - the virus was demonstrated in recent months in wild boars around the capital Warsaw, at about 150 km west from the border. Presentations given for the European Commission[1] regulatory committee on Animal Health, in early December 2017, showed that the virus was found in wild boar carcasses in at least 10 occasions in areas immediately north, west and south of the capital. In total, the virus was confirmed to have killed at least 16 animals at this session.<br />Read all about pig health in the ??Pig Progress Health Tool.[2]<br />Human behaviour behind ASF spread<br />Human behaviour is often named as the main culprit for the spread of the disease, e.g. by people throwing infected food scraps out of the window. This is an explanation for the nearest zone of outbreaks in Poland is around Siedlce city, about 90 km east of the capital, where since September at least 30 cases have been reported to the World Organization for Animal Health[3] (OIE), including one on a small swine farm of 48 pigs.<br />Thirdly, as of 15 November, reports reached the OIE that several carcasses of wild boars had been found in the north east of Warmia-Masuria province, in E?k County, which is located in the north of Poland.<br />The Czech way to deal with ASF<br />In order to contain the virus in certain locations, increasingly stringent local controls are being applied. In the region around Zlín in the Czech Republic, in 2017 the virus was detected in carcasses as well, although the virus was nowhere near a 400 km radius. Local authorities there have effectively locked up all wild boars using boar repellents and electric fences and there is intensive hunting going on.<br />In the Czech Republic, now almost 200 cases of ASF outbreaks in wild boars have been confirmed. Pjoto: Petr Satran, Czech State Veterinary Administration<br />In this contained area, outbreaks continue - the total count by the end of 2017 was 193 wild boars.<br />A similar containment approach is now also taking place in Poland, as the Polish government aims to build a fence with Belarus and Ukraine covering 1,000 km to block infected boars[4] from crossing the border, Pig Progress\' sister title Boerderij reported. The aim is to have it ready by 2021 and should cost about ? 31 million. In addition, local hunting legislation is about to be amended to allow for more intensive hunting.<br />Developments in Russia<br />In Russia, where African Swine Fever has been endemic since 2008, the country\'s largest swine producer Miratorg recently reported an outbreak of the virus at the feeding station Ivica-2 in the Belgorod region in the Central Federal District in December 2017. All the pigs at this feeding station had to be culled, according to information analysis agency eMeat[5].<br />ASF spreads through Moldova<br />Reports reaching the OIE about the ASF situation in Moldova aren\'t hopeful either. Where initial reports mentioned [6]outbreaks only in the far north of the country, recent updates indicate that the virus is found in wild boar carcasses all over the country. In October and November 2017, 2 backyard farms reported to be affected by ASF as well, in Hincesti (4 pigs) and Stefan-Voda (15 pigs), both in more southern regions of the country.<br />References^ Presentations given for the European Commission (ec.europa.eu)^ Health Tool.

Events included more H5N6 outbreaks in Taiwan and more highly pathogenic H7N9 detections in live-poultry markets in China\'s Guangdong province.H5N5 detectionsSerbia\'s agriculture ministry confirmed H5N5 in a mute swan found dead on Jan 20 in a nature park near the city of Zrenjanin in the central part of the country, according to a report from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).Meanwhile, Slovenia also reported H5N1 in three mute swans found dead beginning on Jan 20 near three small villages on the Krka River in the southeast near the border with Croatia, according to a separate OIE notice.Ten European countries have now reported recent H5N5 outbreaks.Taiwan outbreaks from two strainsIn a pair of reports to the OIE, Taiwan reported several more outbreaks involving two highly pathogenic strains, H5N6 and H5N2.The H5N6 outbreaks struck eight more locations, one of them a slaughterhouse. Most of the affected premises are on the southwest side of the island. The events began from Feb 9 to Feb 16, and the affected locations housed turkeys, native chickens, and ducks. Officials also detected highly pathogenic H5N2 at one of the farms.Of 12,410 susceptible birds, the virus killed 4,073, and officials culled the remaining poultry to curb the spread of H5N6.Taiwan has also been battling other avian flu strains over the past 2 years, including H5N2. Today officials reported 11 more H5N2 outbreaks, all involving poultry farms, with start dates ranging from Jan 13 to Feb 17 and affecting mostly locations in Yunlin County.The farms housed native chickens, turkeys, geese, and ducks. One of the facilities was a layer farm. Of 115,300 susceptible birds among the 11 locations, the virus killed 11,233, and authorities culled the remaining poultry.More high-path H7N9 in ChinaComing about a week after it announced its first detection of the highly pathogenic form of H7N9 from a live-market poultry in Guangdong province, China\'s agriculture ministry today reported six more detections from markets in the same province.The markets are located in five different cities: Zongshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Shanwei, and Meizhou. Some of the detections were from swab samples in chickens, and some were environmental samples. The outbreak start dates ranged from Jan 10 to Feb 28.Authorities closed all of the affected markets for cleaning and disinfection and have stepped up surveillance in the areas. So far, contact tracing of the affected birds hasn\'t turned up any outbreaks at source farms.Until this season, H7N9 has been a low-pathogenic strain in poultry, which made it difficult to track the disease in animals and prevent exposure to people.H5N8 developments in EuropeTwo more European countries reported new H5N8 outbreaks, Italy in poultry and Serbia in wild birds and poultry.Italian officials reported two events, both in backyard birds in Veneto province in the northeast. The outbreaks began on Feb 27, and, of 192 susceptible birds, the virus killed 8 and sickened 29. Twenty-one additional birds were culled as a response measure.Meanwhile, Serbia reported nine more H5N8 outbreaks, eight in wild birds and one at a backyard holding.The events began between Feb 3 and Feb 23, occurring across a wide portion of the northern region. The outbreak in backyard birds killed 46 of 52 birds, and 12 mute swans and a grey heron were found dead from the virus, which was also detected in a live mallard and cormorant.See also:Mar 1 OIE report on H5N5 in Serbia[1]Mar 1 OIE report on H5N5 in Slovenia[2]Mar 1 OIE report on H5N6 in Taiwan[3]Mar 1 OIE report on H5N2 in Taiwan[4]Mar 1 OIE report on H7N9 in China[5]Mar 1 OIE report on H5N8 Italy[6]Mar 1 OIE report on H5N8 in Serbia[7]References^ H5N5 in Serbia (www.oie.int)^ H5N5 in Slovenia (www.oie.int)^ H5N6 in Taiwan (www.oie.int)^ H5N2 in Taiwan (www.oie.int)^ H7N9 in China (www.oie.int)^ H5N8 Italy (www.oie.int)^ H5N8 in Serbia (www.oie.int)",http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/03/serbia-slovenia-report-first-h5n5-avian-flu-outbreaks,CIDRAP,"Serbia, Slovenia report first H5N5 avian flu outbreaks",NA,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/serbia-slovenia-report-first-h5n5-avian-flu-outbreaks,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,12,0.75,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Serbia', 'Slovenia', 'Slovenia', 'Slovenia', 'Taiwan', 'Guangdong', 'Zrenjanin', 'Slovenia', 'the Krka River', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'H5N2.The H5N6', 'H5N6.Taiwan', 'Yunlin County', 'Guangdong', 'Zongshan', 'Huizhou', 'Dongguan', 'Meizhou', 'Italy', 'Serbia', 'Veneto', 'Serbia', 'H5N8 Italy[6]Mar', 'Serbia', 'Slovenia', 'Taiwan', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'www.oie.int)^', 'Serbia'],Host(s):['birds', 'poultry', 'turkeys', 'chickens', 'ducks', 'heron'],Agent(s):['highly pathogenic', 'H5N6', 'H7N9', 'H5N2', 'H5N8']","Outbreak:[Serbia, Slovenia report first H5N5 avian flu outbreaks -

5f5d3c6258,"Blue tongue found in Butte County, SD deer | TheFencePost.com - Fence Post","Blue tongue found in Butte County, SD deer<br />PIERRE, S.D. - South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks has documented the first deer mortalities in 2017 due to hemorrhagic disease, also known as epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) or blue tongue. EHD was recently confirmed by laboratory analysis in a white-tailed deer in eastern Harding County and a white-tailed deer in western Butte County.<br />This disease is common in white-tailed deer and is typically detected in late summer or early fall. Minor deer losses to EHD can occur in any given year in South Dakota, but weather and habitat conditions will dictate the severity of the disease. EHD is not infectious to humans.<br />The virus is spread by a biting midge and causes extensive internal hemorrhaging. Many deer exhibit no clinical signs and appear perfectly healthy, while others may have symptoms such as respiratory distress, fever and swelling of the tongue. With highly virulent strains of the virus, deer can be dead within 1-3 days. Affected deer are often found near low lying areas or water, likely due to the deer attempting to combat the high fever.<br />GFP asks anyone who observes sick deer or finds several dead deer in a localized area to contact their local conservation officer or GFP office. This information is valuable to wildlife managers in monitoring deer populations across the state.<br />EHD outbreaks can be locally severe, but rarely affect a high proportion of the deer population. In 2016, however, the disease did affect deer populations in certain areas of eastern South Dakota and license adjustments were made in some hunting units to react to these unforeseen mortality events. Deer can continue to succumb to this disease until a hard freeze reduces midge populations that carry the disease.<br />For more information on the EHD virus, visit gfp.sd.gov/wildlife/diseases/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease.aspx.<br />Recommended Stories For You",http://www.thefencepost.com/news/blue-tongue-found-in-butte-county-sd-deer/,NA,"Blue tongue found in Butte County, SD deer","PIERRE, S.D. – South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks has documented the first deer mortalities in 2017 due to hemorrhagic disease, also known as epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) or",https://www.thefencepost.com/news/blue-tongue-found-in-butte-county-sd-deer/,article,en-US,NA,NA,"DEER, DISEASE, EHD, DAKOTA, SOUTH, COUNTY, GFP, HEMORRHAGIC, POPULATIONS, TAILED",13,,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Butte County', 'Butte County', 'Harding County', 'South Dakota', 'South Dakota'],Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[EHD was recently confirmed by laboratory analysis in a white-tailed deer in eastern Harding County and a white-tailed deer in western Butte County.<br />This disease is common in white-tailed deer and is typically detected in late summer or early fall.],No. of outbreak Sentences:1",Insufficient Metadata,NA,6,,"Spatial Entities---['Butte County', 'Butte County', 'Harding County', 'South Dakota', 'South Dakota']","Temporal Entities---['2017', 'late summer', 'any given year', '1-3 days', '2016']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]",,0.61

62c3d8f520,Cattle owners urged to consider Bluetongue vaccination after rise in ... - Somerset County Gazette,"Cattle owners urged to consider Bluetongue vaccination after rise in French cases<br />Farmers are being advised to consider vaccinating their cattle[1] against the Bluetongue virus (BTV-8) due to outbreaks in Europe.<br />The risk of BTV incursion into UK population remains at LOW (\""rare, but could occur\"") to reflect the low levels of infection in northern France but there have been 474 BTV-8 positive cases four in France since the end of July. However there has been no expansion of the surveillance zone and no new cases reported from near the French northern coast.<br />The lack of disease being reported in the north of France is the main risk mitigation factor. Recent meteorological modelling has shown there have been very few days in the last few months where the wind has been sufficiently strong or in the right direction to reach the UK mainland from the areas in France with the highest level of disease circulation.<br />Switzerland has now reported BTV-8 in cattle in two regions. Single animals tested positive in herds of 90 and 58 cattle and the single animals were both culled. A restriction zone covering the whole country has been put in place to allow free movement of animals around the regions, but exports to other countries must meet certain conditions.<br />The cases in Switzerland are not a surprise given the proximity to cases in France. Indeed, the authorities had been communicating to farmers to expect cases, to vaccinate their animals and to report any suspicious signs to their vets. Vaccination against BTV-4 and BTV-8 is allowed, but this is a voluntary measure which farmers are encouraged to take.<br />These cases appear to be a result of vector movement rather than live animal trade and highlight that proximity to affected areas with high levels of virus circulation and cattle density are key factors in disease transmission.<br />The detection of PCR positive animals in the UK which recently arrived from France from a region with high virus circulation is not confirmation of disease in UK animals. Instead these were picked up as part of the government\'s post import checks and those animals which represented an animal health risk were culled. This serves as a reminder that if farmers wish to import from any BTV restricted zone, vaccinating their own herd before-hand would be a sensible risk mitigation measure.<br />References^ cattle (news.google.com)",http://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/farmer/15645238.Cattle_owners_urged_to_consider_Bluetongue_vaccination_after_rise_in_French_cases/,South West Farmer,Cattle owners urged to consider Bluetongue vaccination after rise in French cases,Farmers are being advised to consider vaccinating their cattle against the Bluetongue virus (BTV-8) due to outbreaks in Europe.,https://www.southwestfarmer.co.uk/news/15645238.cattle-owners-urged-to-consider-bluetongue-vaccination-after-rise-in-french-cases/,website,en,NA,NA,Cattle owners urged to consider Bluetongue vaccination after rise in French cases,14,0.875,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Bluetongue', 'Bluetongue', 'Bluetongue', 'UK', 'France', 'France', 'France', 'UK', 'France', 'Switzerland', 'France', 'UK', 'France', 'UK'],Host(s):['Cattle'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Cattle owners urged to consider Bluetongue vaccination after rise in French cases<br />Farmers are being advised to consider vaccinating their cattle[1] against the Bluetongue virus (BTV-8) due to outbreaks in Europe.<br />The risk of BTV incursion into UK population remains at LOW (\""rare, but could occur\"") to reflect the low levels of infection in northern France but there have been 474 BTV-8 positive cases four in France since the end of July., However there has been no expansion of the surveillance zone and no new cases reported from near the French northern coast.<br />The lack of disease being reported in the north of France is the main risk mitigation factor., Recent meteorological modelling has shown there have been very few days in the last few months where the wind has been sufficiently strong or in the right direction to reach the UK mainland from the areas in France with the highest level of disease circulation.<br />Switzerland has now reported BTV-8 in cattle in two regions., Single animals tested positive in herds of 90 and 58 cattle and the single animals were both culled., A restriction zone covering the whole country has been put in place to allow free movement of animals around the regions, but exports to other countries must meet certain conditions.<br />The cases in Switzerland are not a surprise given the proximity to cases in France., Indeed, the authorities had been communicating to farmers to expect cases, to vaccinate their animals and to report any suspicious signs to their vets., Vaccination against BTV-4 and BTV-8 is allowed, but this is a voluntary measure which farmers are encouraged to take.<br />These cases appear to be a result of vector movement rather than live animal trade and highlight that proximity to affected areas with high levels of virus circulation and cattle density are key factors in disease transmission.<br />The detection of PCR positive animals in the UK which recently arrived from France from a region with high virus circulation is not confirmation of disease in UK animals.],No. of outbreak Sentences:7",Sufficient Metadata,South West Farmer,11,0.611111111,"Spatial Entities---['Bluetongue', 'Bluetongue', 'Bluetongue', 'UK', 'France', 'France', 'France', 'UK', 'France', 'Switzerland', 'France', 'UK', 'France', 'UK']","Temporal Entities---['the end of July', 'the last few months']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['Cattle'],Agent(s):[]",0.62,0.83

3dd05980da,Hungary detects fresh case of African swine fever in wild boar - Reuters,"Hungary detects fresh case of African swine fever in wild boar<br />BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary detected a fresh case of African swine fever in wild boar this week but the disease has not spread to domestic pigs, the national food safety authority NEBIH said. FILE PHOTO: A wild boar walks past hundreds of deer standing in a flooded forest in the Danube-Drava National Park, 150 km south from Budapest, August 20, 2002. REUTERS/Laszlo Balogh/File PhotoRussia\'s agriculture safety watchdog on Monday introduced temporary restrictions on pig and pork imports from Hungary due to an outbreak of the disease in Heves region in eastern Hungary where the fresh case was also detected. \""In Hungary so far the African swine fever has only been identified by laboratory tests in wild boars,\"" NEBIH said in a reply to Reuters questions late on Thursday. It said Heves county was the most at risk from the disease at the moment. On Thursday, China said it had banned imports of pigs, wild boars and pig-related products from Hungary following the Heves case. When the first case was detected late last month, NEBIH introduced measures including an organized search for wild boar carcasses and temporarily suspended hunting in the affected area. According to the NEBIH website, so far the disease has been identified in seven dead wild boars. \""This (measure) will remain in place until authorities manage to clarify the extent of the infection,\"" NEBIH said, adding that after that hunting of wild boars will be encouraged. African swine fever is a highly contagious disease that affects pigs and wild boar and has been spreading in Eastern Europe in recent years. It does not affect humans. Germany issued a decree in February to allow hunters to shoot wild boar year-round to stop the animals, which can carry African swine fever, from passing the deadly infection on to farm pigs. While no case has yet been detected in Germany\'s wild boar population, the spread of the disease in eastern Europe has been causing immense concern in Germany. Hungary\'s neighbor, Romania, reported an outbreak of African swine fever among backyard pigs in the town of Micula in the north of the country, some 7 km from the border with Hungary and Ukraine, earlier this year.

fb1d644f66,Fresh outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease detected in Mat South - Bulawayo24 News (press release) (blog),"Fresh outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease detected in Mat South<br />A FRESH outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) has been detected in the Esigodini area of Matabeleland South Province.Matabeleland South provincial veterinary officer Dr Mbuso Moyo said the highly contagious viral disease was reported last week although he said it was not severe.\""I can confirm that there is an outbreak of FMD at Mpisi dip tank in Esigodini. We confirmed the presence of the disease on Thursday (last week). We don\'t know where it is emanating from but it not that severe, it\'s mild.\""We are, however, urging farmers in the affected area and surrounding areas to adhere to procedural and recommended movement of cattle as prescribed by the Department of Veterinary Services and avoid any unauthorised movements to guard against the spread of the disease,\"" said Dr Moyo.The first recent catastrophic FMD outbreak was reported on 27 April 2014 in Masvingo Province\'s Mwenezi District and later spread to the Matabeleland region.FMD is a severe, highly contagious viral disease of livestock with significant economic impact. The disease affects cattle and pigs as well as sheep, goats, and other cloven-hoofed ruminants. All species of deer and antelope as well as elephant, and giraffe are susceptible to FMD.In a susceptible population, morbidity approaches 100 percent. Intensively reared animals are more susceptible to the disease than traditional breeds. The disease is rarely fatal in adult animals but there is often high mortality in young animals due to myocarditis or by lack of milk when the dam is infected by the disease.<br />FMD is characterised by fever and blister-like sores on the tongue and lips, in the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves. The disease causes severe production losses and while most affected animals recover, the disease often leaves them debilitated.The first case of FMD in the country was clinically detected on 16 August 2000 in a cattle feedlot in south-western Zimbabwe.Prior to the outbreak, the country was known as an exporter of meat especially to the European market.Over the past few months FMD has reported spread to most parts of Masvingo, Midlands, Matabeleland North and South provinces.The spread has resulted in the Government banning the movement of cattle especially in areas regarded as red zones.This has also resulted in the suspension of Bulawayo\'s most popular cattle auctions at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair grounds.The Veterinary Department has previously noted that about 2,5 million of the country\'s cattle were in danger of being affected by FMD and more than $20 million was needed to vaccinate the animals mostly in the southern parts of the country.However, the Government does not have enough resources to procure the doses.",http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-News-sc-Regional-byo-91004.html,Bulawayo24 News,Fresh outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease detected in Mat South,A FRESH outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) has been detected in the Esigodini area of Matabeleland South Province.Matabeleland South provincial veterinary...,https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-regional-byo-91004.html,Article,en_GB,NA,NA,"Bulawayo24,BYO24, Bulawayo24 News, Todays news,breaking news,latest news,news latest breaking stories, online news, world news,Bulawayo news,Zimbabwe news,Africa news, local news, celebrity news, todays sport news, todays travel news,,Foot and mouth,Disease,Outbreak",14,0.875,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Mat South - Bulawayo24 News', 'South', 'Matabeleland South Province', 'Matabeleland South', 'Mpisi', 'Esigodini', 'Mwenezi District', 'Matabeleland', 'Zimbabwe', 'Midlands'],Host(s):['cattle', 'pigs', 'goats'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Matabeleland South provincial veterinary officer Dr Mbuso Moyo said the highly contagious viral disease was reported last week although he said it was not severe.\""I can confirm that there is an outbreak of FMD at Mpisi dip tank in Esigodini., We confirmed the presence of the disease on Thursday (last week)., The first recent catastrophic FMD outbreak was reported on 27 April 2014 in Masvingo Province\'s Mwenezi District and later spread to the Matabeleland region., The disease is rarely fatal in adult animals but there is often high mortality in young animals due to myocarditis or by lack of milk when the dam is infected by the disease.<br />FMD is characterised by fever and blister-like sores on the tongue and lips, in the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves., The first case of FMD in the country was clinically detected on 16 August 2000 in a cattle feedlot in south-western Zimbabwe., Over the past few months FMD has reported spread to most parts of Masvingo, Midlands, Matabeleland North and South provinces.],No. of outbreak Sentences:6",Sufficient Metadata,Bulawayo24 News,11,0.611111111,"Spatial Entities---['Mat South - Bulawayo24 News', 'South', 'Matabeleland South Province', 'Matabeleland South', 'Mpisi', 'Esigodini', 'Mwenezi District', 'Matabeleland', 'Zimbabwe', 'Midlands']","Temporal Entities---['last week', 'Thursday', '27 April 2014', '16 August 2000', 'the past few months']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['cattle', 'pigs', 'goats'],Agent(s):[]",0.56,0.83

All trade partners, veterinary authorities of neighbouring countries and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have been notified as necessary,\"" she said.\""Poultry keeping enterprises are urged to enhance their bio-security measures to promote tight and continuous separation from wild birds, while the exact source, thought to be wild ducks and geese in a nearby water body, is being investigated,\"" she said.Dr Ushewokunze-Obatolu said the outbreak of avian influenza involved the serotype H5 N8 of the Avian Influenza virus, which had been spreading in a second wave around the world since 2010.The virus has been re-introduced to Europe from Asia, where it remained in continuous circulation and was detected in Uganda, among other countries in Africa, earlier this year.\""Influenza viruses are highly contagious and therefore spread very quickly in susceptible populations. The viruses occur naturally in wild water birds. However, the viruses change dynamically and highly virulent strains can occur from time to time, causing major human and animal illness and death,\"" she said.\""Unlike other serotypes, which have caused concern in past years, H5 N8 wherever it has occurred recently, has not shown any risk to humans,\"" she said.Symptoms of avian influenza include quick illness and sudden deaths.Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development Minister Dr Joseph Made, yesterday warned farmers against undermining authorities such as the Department of Veterinary Services and animal health departments.\""This concerns animal and plant diseases. To minimise the spread of diseases, farmers should respect various authorities that deal with plant and animal quarantine,\"" he said.We can all see what is happening to the varied weather conditions. We have come out of continuous rains from summer to winter; we had floods, torrential rains and in some pockets outbreaks of anthrax.\""He said while rains were good, farmers should watch out for a number of diseases.\""When authorities give warnings to the public they should be respected so we can deal with situations that have been brought about by the varied weather conditions.\""The DVS is monitoring areas to look at avian influenza.

c6b7cc9c0e,H5N8 avian flu outbreaks expand to Wales - CIDRAP,"H5N8 avian flu outbreaks expand to Wales<br />The quick pace of avian flu developments saw no let-up today, with highly pathogenic H5N8 reported for the first time in Wales and further spread in wild birds and poultry flocks in a handful of already-affected European countries.In another development, Montenegro\'s agriculture ministry issued a statement saying that tests on a wild duck found near Skadar Lake were positive for highly pathogenic H5N5. A media report on Dec 20, citing the country\'s state television, had said tests found H5N8, the strain fueling outbreaks in Montenegro\'s neighbors and more than a dozen other European countries.Because of a surge in recent avian flu activity, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) yesterday announced the launch of a new avian influenza portal, designed to provide easier access to information and recommendations and enable experts to follow virus evolution in real time. The portal also has a dedicated page offering tools for communicating with different audiences.H5N8 in WalesA statement from the Welsh government said today that tests on a wild duck in Llanelli in Carmarthenshire County, located in the southwest part of the country, were positive for H5N8. The announcement comes less than a week after animal health officials in the United Kingdom announced the first outbreak in England, which affected a turkey farm in the eastern part of the country.Earlier this month Wales established a prevention zone requiring all poultry to be kept indoors or take steps to isolate them from wild birds. A few days ago the government temporarily suspended poultry gatherings.Lesley Griffiths, cabinet secretary for environment and rural affairs, said in the statement, \""This finding is not unexpected and follows calls for bird keepers to be more vigilant for signs of the disease. It is likely that more cases will be confirmed.\""H5N5 in MontenegroClarification on the strain involved in Montenegro\'s recent avian flu finding was noted in a Dec 20 statement in Montenegrin from the country\'s agriculture ministry. According to a machine translation, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said the H5N5 strain confirmed in Montenegro has only previously been confirmed in the Netherlands.On Dec 15 the Netherlands reported H5N5 in a tufted duck found in a wetland area near Werkendam.Montenegro authorities urged farmers to follow precautions issued earlier this month after H5N8 was detected in Serbia, its northeastern neighbor.Four European countries report more H5N8In other developments, Sweden, Finland, and Germany reported more H5N8 detections in wild birds, as France noted that the virus hit five more duck farms, all in Gers department, according to separate reports to the OIE.Sweden reported three outbreaks, all in Skane County in the far southern part of the country. Taken together, the virus was detected in four wild birds: two buzzards, a white-tailed eagle, and a magpie.Finland\'s outbreaks occurred near the towns of Rauma and Sund, both in the southwestern part of the country. Each event involved a single detection in a bird of prey, a white-tailed eagle and an owl.Germany reported five more outbreaks involving wild birds in five different states: Saxony-Anhalt, Lower Saxony, Baden-Wurttemberg, Hesse, and North Rhine-Westphalia. Among them, H5N8 was found in five birds, including four ducks and a stork.Meanwhile, the five outbreaks in Gers department, an area in southwestern France that has been hit hard by avian flu outbreaks for a second year in a row, involved flocks totaling more than 16,000 ducks. Bird deaths prompted testing and detection at three of the locations, while the virus was found during enhanced surveillance at the other two.Among the five farms, the virus killed 561 of 16,340 birds, and the remaining ones were culled to control the spread of the virus.See also:Dec 22 Welsh government statement[1]Dec 21 OIE statement[2]OIE avian influenza portal[3]Dec 20 Montenegro agriculture ministry statement[4]Dec 21 OIE report on H5N8 in Sweden[5]Dec 21 OIE report on H5N8 in Finland[6]Dec 21 OIE report on H5N8 in Germany[7]Dec 21 OIE report on H5N8 in France[8]References^ statement (gov.wales)^ statement (www.oie.int)^ avian influenza portal (www.oie.int)^ statement (www.mpr.gov.me)^ report on H5N8 in Sweden (www.oie.int)^ report on H5N8 in Finland (www.oie.int)^ report on H5N8 in Germany (www.oie.int)^ report on H5N8 in France (www.oie.int)",http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/12/h5n8-avian-flu-outbreaks-expand-wales,CIDRAP,H5N8 avian flu outbreaks expand to Wales,NA,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/h5n8-avian-flu-outbreaks-expand-wales,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,12,0.75,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Wales', 'Wales', 'Skadar Lake', 'Montenegro\\', 'Llanelli', 'Carmarthenshire County', 'the United Kingdom', 'England', 'turkey', 'Montenegrin', 'Montenegro', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands', 'Werkendam', 'Montenegro', 'Serbia', 'Sweden', 'Finland', 'Germany', 'France', 'Skane County', 'Germany', 'Lower Saxony', 'Baden-Wurttemberg', 'Hesse', 'North Rhine-Westphalia', 'France', 'Sweden', 'Finland', 'Germany', 'France'],Host(s):['birds', 'poultry', 'duck', 'bird', 'eagle', 'ducks'],Agent(s):['CIDRAP.H5N8', 'highly pathogenic', 'H5N8', 'confirmed.\\""H5N5']","Outbreak:[H5N8 avian flu outbreaks expand to Wales -

Farmers in Zimbabwe can use all the tools that they have at their disposal to make livestock farming more profitable,\"" Thompson said in an interview with RadioVOP on the sidelines of the multi-stakeholder meeting for the development of a national FMD control strategy for Zimbabwe held in Bulawayo Tuesday.<br />He said countries such as India and Kenya were thriving despite being heavily hit by FMD as Zimbabwe.<br />FMD according to livestock experts is a viral infection that causes fever and blisters in animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, some wild animals (buffalos).The blisters mainly affect the animal\'s mouth and feet.<br />Meanwhile, Thompson said consuming beef infected with FMD was not a health hazard.<br />He said he worked closely with infected animals but never got infected.<br />Speaking during the same occasion, director division of veterinary services Josphat Nyika said Zimbabwe has over the past year experienced incessant FMD outbreaks with the disease now having spread into six of the country\'s eight provinces, in spite of government efforts to control outbreaks, through rigorous livestock vaccination campaigns and enforcement of strict movement restrictions.<br />He said a recurrent drought in the country, most severe in the southern and western parts of the country, has unfortunately forced communal farmers to move their livestock to areas adjacent to national parks, in search of relief grazing and water sources.<br />\""This has increased buffalo/cattle contact and worsening the potential for the spread of the disease,\"" he said.<br />Nyika said the Ministry of Agriculture Mechanization Irrigation and Development has managed to reduce the impact of FMD despite challenges in accessing adequate resources to fund disease control programs.<br />\""Livestock productivity and farmer livelihoods in affected areas have been severely affected.

1eddffe68d,Zim turns to Namibia to beef up stocks as drought bites - African Independent,"Zim turns to Namibia to beef up stocks as drought bites<br />Zimbabwe has turned to Namibia for its beef requirements as drought, foot and mouth disease and the land reform programme has severely depleted its national cattle herd. Addressing diplomats at the launch of an international appeal for food aid and drought relief mechanism, Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa said the livestock condition was dire and the situation had been compounded by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth. <br />\""Cumulative livestock deaths as a result of the drought are at 16 681 with Masvingo province being the highest at 6 566,\"" he said.At least $138 million was needed for supplementary feeding while $53 million was required for livestock destocking, he said.<br />In 2 000, thousands of beef cattle were burnt alive during the country\'s land reform programme. There were widespread reports of land invaders killing cattle just to roast the livers.<br />According to the Commercial Farmers\' Union of Zimbabwe, drought was having the biggest impact on the beef industry.<br />\""The second constraint is the high levels of Rural District Council cattle marketing levies which reduce farmer viability. At 10.5% of the sale price of cattle, this amounts to nearly $70 per animal. Another issue is the alarming spread of foot and mouth disease.\""<br />What made matters worse is the failure by the once leading meat supplier in Africa, Cold Storage Commission, to revive its operations.<br />Zimbabwe will need to dispatch a veterinary delegation to Namibia to inspect facilities by next Friday, before exports can begin.<br />Deputy Minister of Agriculture responsible for livestock, Paddy Zhanda, said there was nothing unusual about Zimbabwe importing or Namibia exporting beef, and it didn\'t mean Zimbabwe had a shortage of livestock.<br />\""This does not mean there is a shortage of livestock in Zimbabwe. We don\'t have a shortage. Moreover, as government we do not import beef. It is individuals who do that,\"" he said.<br />Presenting the 2017 national budget in December, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa said Zimbabwe had a national herd of 5.5 million cattle and it intended to boost the herd by 300 000.<br />He said the government had set aside $6m for extension services and the veterinary department to enhance livestock monitoring and disease control.",https://www.africanindy.com/news/zim-turns-to-namibia-to-beef-up-stocks-as-drought-bites-9920158,NA,African Independent | Rewriting Africa’s Narrative,"Engage with ground-breaking stories hailing from the African continent, spanning business, technology, travel, sport, culture and lifestyle on African Independent.",NA,article,en,NA,NA,NA,12,,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Namibia', 'Namibia', 'Namibia', 'Zimbabwe', 'Africa', 'Namibia', 'Zimbabwe', 'Namibia', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe'],Host(s):['cattle'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[<br />\""Cumulative livestock deaths as a result of the drought are at 16 681 with Masvingo province being the highest at 6 566,\"" he said., There were widespread reports of land invaders killing cattle just to roast the livers.<br />According to the Commercial Farmers\' Union of Zimbabwe, drought was having the biggest impact on the beef industry.<br />\""The second constraint is the high levels of Rural District Council cattle marketing levies which reduce farmer viability.],No. of outbreak Sentences:2",Insufficient Metadata,NA,7,,"Spatial Entities---['Namibia', 'Namibia', 'Namibia', 'Zimbabwe', 'Africa', 'Namibia', 'Zimbabwe', 'Namibia', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe']","Temporal Entities---['next Friday', '2017', 'December']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['cattle'],Agent(s):[]",,0.61
2785206613,Cattle and pork producers say US ill-prepared against foot-and-mouth disease - mySanAntonio.com,"Cattle and pork producers say US ill-prepared against foot-and-mouth disease<br />Livestock producers are seeking $750 million to beef up the nation\'s vaccine bank for foot-and-mouth disease, saying an outbreak on U.S. soil would quickly reach epidemic proportions and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in losses to producers of cattle, pork, sheep and other livestock.<br />Foot-and-mouth disease, or FMD, is a highly contagious viral disease that was considered eradicated from the U.S. in 1929, but remains endemic in Africa, Asia, some South American countries and the Middle East. While it does not affect humans and is not considered a public health or food safety threat, it sickens cows, pigs, sheep, goats, deer and other animals with divided hoofs. Infected animals usually must be euthanized. <br />There hasn\'t been a recent outbreak in the U.S. to cause alarm, but the nation\'s vaccine bank in Plum Island, New York, has antigens for only 10 of the 23 strains currently circulating around the globe, David Herring[1], vice president of the National Pork Producers Council[2] said at a hearing Tuesday of the House Agriculture Committee[3]\'s Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture.<br />The hearing was part of a whirlwind of events setting the groundwork for the next farm bill, a roughly $1 trillion five-year spending plan that covers food stamps and other federal nutrition programs and sets standards for crop insurance, farm support programs and an array of other programs affecting U.S. agriculture and forestry. House Agriculture Committee Michael Conaway[4], R-Midland, has said he is committed to getting the 2018 farm bill passed on time.<br />U.S. pork exports reached a record 2.3 million metric tons in 2016, accounting for 26 percent of production. Those markets would quickly close if the disease was detected, he said, adding that it wouldn\'t take much for terrorists to unleash FMD in the U.S. as a way of hurting the U.S. food supply and inflicting serious economic damage.<br />\""The U.S. pork industry\'s top priority for the next farm bill is establishing a foot and mouth disease vaccine bank,\"" Herring said. \""If this country ever had an FMD outbreak not only could it devastate my farm and the whole livestock industry but the entire U.S. economy.\"" <br />Craig Uden[5], president of the National Cattlemen[6]\'s Beef Association[7], said an FMD outbreak would cause enormous economic losses not only to livestock producers, but also auction markets, slaughterhouses, food processors and related industries, and consumers.<br />\""We feel that this vaccine bank is vitally important to the beef industry as FMD is still a threat as countries around the world continue to grapple with the disease,\"" Uden said.<br />Herring cited research from Iowa State University[8] concluding an FMD outbreak could cost pork, beef, corn and soybean producers $200 billion over 10 years. Since any of the strains could be the culprit, an adequate vaccine strategy would require 10 million doses for each of the 23 strains as well as surge capacity for 40 million doses, he said.<br />The producers are asking for $150 million for each of the five years of the farm bill to contract for an offshore, vendor-maintained vaccine antigen bank with inventory to cover the first two weeks of an outbreak. The money also would allow for a contract with an international manufacturer to provide surge capacity.<br />David Anderson[9], an agricultural economist at Texas A&M University, said it wasn\'t surprising that disease outbreak control would be a top priority for livestock producers.<br />The avian flu outbreak that spread through northern U.S. flocks in 2014 and 2015 forced destruction of some 50 million birds and caused more than $3.3 billion in economic damages. A current outbreak of avian flu has already forced euthanasia of some 200,000 animals in three southern states. In 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea showed in U.S. swine for the first time, and by mid-2014 had spread through 27 states.<br />\""We couldn\'t have spread it any faster if we tried,\"" Herring said.<br />\""It\'s really an economic disease,\"" Anderson said. \""The procedure around the world is that when a country has an outbreak, everybody bans their product. It\'s really devastating. The response has been you quarantine the area and kill all the animals.\"" <br />Cattle ranchers in Texas, the nation\'s leading cattle producing state, were among those opposed to the USDA[10]\'s Aug. 1 decision to allow imports of fresh and frozen beef from Brazil. The announcement coincided with Brazil\'s decision to reopen its markets to U.S. beef, which had been banned due a 2003 incidence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. Ranchers said they were not convinced Brazil has a handle on foot-and-mouth disease.<br />\""It\'s nothing about trade or having their beef come into the United States, the issue is health and herd security,\"" Saginaw rancher Pete Bonds said. \""There\'s still some cases of foot and mouth disease in Brazil. They\'re saying they\'ve got it under control with vaccinations; I don\'t believe them.\""<br />\""The problem is if hoof and mouth would ever hit in the state of Texas, the cattle industry as we know it today is over,\"" Bonds said. \""Hogs are actually more susceptible to hoof and mouth than cattle. And with the wild hog population in the state of Texas there\'s no way we can control it.\""<br />An inquiry into a devastating 2001 FMD outbreak in England determined a likely cause to be domestic hogs that were fed contaminated beef.<br />\""It was not cooked properly. It was fed to hogs and hogs got it and transferred it to cattle,\"" Bonds said. \""If you think about it, you don\'t cook hamburger well enough, you throw it down, a wild hog comes and eats it and then it gets started.\""<br />lbrezosky@express-news.net<br />@lbrezosky<br />References^ David Herring (news.google.com)^ National Pork Producers Council (news.google.com)^ House Agriculture Committee (news.google.com)^ Agriculture Committee Michael Conaway (news.google.com)^ Craig Uden (news.google.com)^ National Cattlemen (news.google.com)^ Beef Association (news.google.com)^ Iowa State University (news.google.com)^ David Anderson (news.google.com)^ USDA (news.google.com)",http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/national/article/Cattle-and-pork-producers-say-US-ill-prepared-11020950.php,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,9,,403,Restricted,"Location(s):['US', 'US', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'the Middle East', 'U.S.', 'Plum Island', 'New York', 'U.S.', 'R-Midland', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', '/>\\""We', 'Iowa', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Texas', 'Brazil', 'U.S.', 'Brazil', 'the United States', 'Brazil', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'England'],Host(s):['Cattle', 'humans', 'pigs', 'goats', 'birds'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[The response has been you quarantine the area and kill all the animals.\"" <br />Cattle ranchers in Texas, the nation\'s leading cattle producing state, were among those opposed to the USDA[10]\'s Aug. 1 decision to allow imports of fresh and frozen beef from Brazil., \""There\'s still some cases of foot and mouth disease in Brazil.],No. of outbreak Sentences:2",Insufficient Metadata,NA,8,,"Spatial Entities---['US', 'US', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'the Middle East', 'U.S.', 'Plum Island', 'New York', 'U.S.', 'R-Midland', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', '/>\\""We', 'Iowa', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Texas', 'Brazil', 'U.S.', 'Brazil', 'the United States', 'Brazil', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'England']","Temporal Entities---['1929', 'Tuesday', 'five-year', '2018', '2016', '10 years', 'the five years', 'the first two weeks', '2014', '2015', '2013', 'mid-2014', 'Aug. 1', '2003', 'today']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['Cattle', 'humans', 'pigs', 'goats', 'birds'],Agent(s):[]",,0.55

c6414bd506,EU donates ?8m to fight foot and mouth - NewsDay,"EU donates ?8m to fight foot and mouth<br />THE European Union (EU) has given the Zimbabwean government ?8 million for anthrax and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) control, an official has said.<br />BY MTHANDAZO NYONI<br />The fund, expected to run over a four-year period under the theme Increased household food, income and nutrition security through commercialisation of an integrated and sustainable smallholder livestock sector in Zimbabwe, is being implemented by Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in partnership with Department of Livestock and Veterinary Services and two non-governmental organisations - Help Germany and Lead.<br />Speaking at a multi-stakeholder meeting for the development of a national FMD control strategy for Zimbabwe held in Bulawayo on Tuesday, veterinary services division director, Josphat Nyika said FAO has, through various donors, offered FMD support to the government, from as far back as 2006. <br />\""This support has been just under $10 million. Currently, the Ministry of Agriculture Mechanisation Irrigation and Development is receiving support for anthrax and FMD control through a four-year programme worth ?8 million. This is the project funding the FMD strategy development and consultative process,\"" he said.<br />Nyika said the second FAO-funded Technical Co-operation Projects (TCPs), valued at $856 000 were also supporting FMD control. <br />\""The third projects have together procured 500 000 doses of FMD vaccine, as well as vaccination equipment, offered support for a post vaccination monitoring programme and trainings of veterinary extension staff in participatory surveillance,\"" he said.<br />The government is struggling to control FMD and anthrax. The country\'s beef industry has been struggling for over a decade, since the European Union banned meat imports from Zimbabwe due to FMD outbreaks.<br />EU banned Zimbabwean beef exports in August 2001 after a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak which was also recently detected in Midlands, Matabeleland and Masvingo provinces.<br />Beef production was once the pride of the commercial farming sector, contributing $100 million a year.<br />Nyika said foot and mouth disease in cattle has occurred several times since 1931 when it was officially diagnosed in south-east Zimbabwe. <br />He said Zimbabwe has over the past year experienced incessant FMD outbreaks, with the disease now having spread to six of the country\'s eight rural provinces, in spite of government efforts to control outbreaks, through rigorous livestock vaccination campaigns and enforcement of strict movement restrictions. <br />Nyika said a recurrent drought in the country, most severe in the southern and western parts, has forced communal farmers to move their livestock to areas adjacent to national parks, in search of relief grazing and water sources. This has increased buffalo-cattle contact and increasing incidents of the disease. <br />He said government, has through the department of Livestock and Veterinary Services, managed to reduce the impact of FMD despite challenges in accessing adequate resources to fund disease control programmes. <br />\""Livestock productivity and farmer livelihoods in affected areas have been severely affected. The increased risk of FMD incursion into the traditionally FMD free zones, and into neighbouring countries, is an indisputable possibility.<br />\""The current scenario also places limitations on the country\'s level of competitiveness as a result of non-compliance to regional and international trade conditions,\"" he said.<br />Nyika said effective management of FMD was, therefore, essential if the country was to fully exploit potential trade opportunities that exist with improved livestock production and health. <br />\""It is in view of the stated predicament that the government of Zimbabwe has sought to develop a comprehensive and inclusive national FMD control strategy with the full participation of all livestock value chain actors,\"" he said.<br />\""I am pleased to inform you that FAO is committed to playing its role in the control of trans-boundary animal diseases by ensuring an enabling environment for livestock value chain actors.\""<br />At regional level, Nyika said FAO was supporting the review of the commodity-based trade guidelines, as recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health.The guidelines and publications from this initiative will help to improve understanding of the approach and facilitate its subsequent implementation in the region, he added.<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",https://www.newsday.co.zw/2016/02/19/eu-donates-e8m-fight-foot-mouth/,NewsDay,EU donates €8m to fight foot and mouth,EU donates €8m to fight foot and mouth,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/newsday/uploads/2016/02/Lesion_in_cleft_of_hoof_of_cow_with_foot-and-mouth_disease_in_Kenya_1996.jpg,website,en,NA,NA,,14,0.875,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['EU', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe', 'Midlands', 'Matabeleland', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe'],Host(s):['cattle'],Agent(s):[]",NA,Sufficient Metadata,NewsDay,11,0.611111111,"Spatial Entities---['EU', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe', 'Midlands', 'Matabeleland', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimbabwe']","Temporal Entities---['four-year', 'Tuesday', '2006', 'over a decade', 'August 2001', '1931', 'the past year']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['cattle'],Agent(s):[]",0.55,0.83

8ca6863402,China live trade to further boost competition for cattle - Katherine Times,"China live trade to further boost competition for cattle<br />Live cattle exporters are spending big with their eye on servicing China.<br />Wellard general manager China Bernie Brosnan.WITH big investments being made by live cattle trade operators in Australia to service the emerging China slaughter market, producers are starting to take stock of just how significant the extra buyer demand in the market will be.Even against a backdrop of already hot competition for the tight supply of cattle at the moment, the addition of an extra, significant, buyer is not to be taken lightly, producer and industry leaders say.Cattle Council of Australia president Howard Smith said the expanded marketing options for producers would be very valuable and the China trade would be a \'whole of Australia\' opportunity.Exporters suggest Chinese demand for live cattle for immediate processing could see up to 150,000 shipped there this year, and more next year.Those sort of numbers will make a big difference, Mr Smith said.While initially, cattle will be sourced from the south due to the Chinese bluetongue virus free zone requirement, the pull-through effect would be immediate, he said.\""This is a very positive event for our industry,\"" he said.\""As we get the first shipment in place and sort out teething issues, and demonstrate it can be done profitability, we\'ll see greater numbers shipped.\""In the north, we\'ve recently seen how the boats taking slaughter cattle to Vietnam put a floor in the market and the China trade has the potential to do the same in southern Australia this year.\""Hot on the heels of Elders announcing it is about to put Australia\'s first seabound live slaughter cattle shipment to Chinese meatworks on the water, the country\'s largest cattle exporter Wellard announced the purchase of a farm in Western Victoria where it will develop a pre-export quarantine facility.Wellard says the 340 hectare farm, \""Clonlee\"" will be its base to secure and induct beef and dairy cattle from throughout Victoria, South Australia and southern NSW to meet China\'s stringent quarantine access requirements, as well as other markets.Chinese import requirements include a seven-day quarantine period in Australia for slaughter cattle and an \'all-in-all-out\' policy preventing co-sharing with other consignments.Wellard general manager China Bernie Brosnan said the company would invest in infrastructure on the property so it can become a modern and efficient facility and that investment would be staged to reflect the level of Chinese export activity.Wellard last year teamed up with Chinese company Fulida Group to build a series of feedlots and an abattoir in China to fatten and process Australian cattle and market the beef.Chief executive officer with peak industry body the Australian Livestock Exporters\' Council (ALEC) Simon Westaway said there was certainly strategic investment happening to streamline supply chain logistics in preparation for the China trade.Chief executive officer with peak industry body the Australian Livestock Exporters\' Council (ALEC) Simon Westaway.Easy access to quarantine facilities close to relevant Australian ports was a high priority, while ongoing investment in modern livestock vessels was helping to ensure cattle could be shipped as efficiently as possible, with the world\'s best welfare standards, he said.There was also significant in-market investment in China, he said.The fact infrastructure that complies with Australia\'s exporter supply chain assurance system (ESCAS) was being built from the ground up in what will be \'closed loop\' supply chains meant the highest possible welfare, control and traceability standards were being put in place, he said.\""The scale of the investment is underpinned by the growing demand for Australian cattle and boosts our confidence about the long-term significance of the market,\"" Mr Westaway said.\""More competition for cattle is a good thing for producers and opening up significant new markets such as the feeder/slaughter trade to China strengthens Australia\'s entire beef industry.\""From the exporter\'s perspective, the more markets Australia supplies, the greater the stability in the overall trade and the greater the confidence for all to invest in supply chain development, Mr Westaway said.Livestock exporters were entrepreneurial by nature and were constantly looking for new market opportunities, he said.\""The opening of new trade opportunities in China builds on our existing markets,\"" he said.Stable volumes of feeders to Indonesia through December saw live cattle exports finish 2016 at 1.129 million head, slightly up on the expected figure of under a million.Still, that was down 15 per cent on 2015 numbers, although the previous two years have seen record numbers of live cattle exported.Meat and Livestock Australia analysts say the the prospect of an 800,000 head export year in 2017 appears more likely than the recent highs, as the northern Australian cattle herd again looks to rebuild.High cattle prices, short supply, unfavourable exchange rates, vessels coming off contract and policy changes along with market consolidation in some of the key export markets influenced last year\'s decline,

71238345d5,Egypt Imports Cattle from Ireland After 20-year Hiatus - TheCattleSite,"Egypt Imports Cattle from Ireland After 20-year Hiatus<br />NewsEgypt Imports Cattle from Ireland After 20-year Hiatus08 August 2017 EGYPT - Irish exporters expressed their willingness to secure a contract to supply cattle to the Egyptian market, according to AgriLand\'s website.Daily News Egypt[1] reports that this keenness came after lifting Egypt\'s ban on the import of Irish meat, which lasted for 20 years because of mad cow disease.<br />The website said that the Egyptian market has an annual demand of 150,000 cattle, predominately serviced by imports from South America.<br />\""Earlier this week, the Department of Agriculture agreed health certificates with Egyptian authorities to allow fattening livestock to be exported to the North African market,\"" said the website. \""Irish exporters will be made aware of the country\'s cattle requirements in the coming days, and a number of high-profile shippers are thought to be keen on exporting Irish cattle to Egypt\"".<br />Under the agreed terms, Irish cattle are required to spend 21 days in quarantine prior to being shipped to Egypt.<br />In addition, the livestock destined to be exported must be under 12 months of age and less than 225 kg in weight at the beginning of this quarantine period.<br />Furthermore, exports to Egypt hinge on Ireland\'s bluetongue-free status, and all animals are required to have been kept in a bluetongue-free country since birth, according to the website.<br />This could give Irish cattle an advantage over those sourced from other countries, such as France. Like Ireland, French authorities agreed on health certificates with Egyptian officials in recent weeks.<br />However, a number of cases of bluetongue have been recorded in France this year, and this could potentially limit the country\'s ability to ship cattle to Egypt.<br />Regarding prices, the website said that Egyptian buyers will be particularly interested in securing Friesian-type cattle for further feeding. But the market price of these animals will most likely dictate the quantity, if any, exported from Ireland in the near future.<br />In 2016, an agreement was reached between Irish and Egyptian authorities to ship finished livestock to the North African market.<br />In 2016, the Egyptian buyers were willing to pay ?2.60/kg for finished Irish cattle; approximately 50-60c/kg of this was set aside to cover assembly, transportation, and quarantine costs.<br />However, Irish cattle prices were too expensive and buyers for the Egyptian market were unable to secure the supplies they desired to make exports viable.<br />The Irish Farmers\' Association\'s (IFA\'s) National Livestock chairperson, Angus Woods, has called upon the Minister of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine, Michael Creed, to include a visit to Egypt-focusing on live cattle exports-in his autumn schedule.<br />In March, a meeting between the president of the IFA, Joe Healy, and Egyptian Ambassador Soha Gendi to discuss the outlined details of a government project seeking 1 million head of livestock to be exported to Egypt.<br />The ambassador also explained that Ireland had been prioritised as one of the top countries, which Egypt hopes to cooperate with in relation to the project.<br />TheCattleSite News Desk Top image via Shutterstock[2] <br />References^ Daily News Egypt (dailynewsegypt.com)^ Shutterstock (www.shutterstock.com)",http://www.thecattlesite.com/news/51867/egypt-imports-cattle-from-ireland-after-20year-hiatus,NA,NA,NA,https://www.thecattlesite.com/,website,en,NA,NA,NA,11,,404,Not Available,"Location(s):['Egypt', 'Ireland', 'Egypt', 'Ireland', 'Ireland', 'EGYPT', 'Egypt', 'France', 'Ireland', 'France', 'Ireland', 'the North African market.<br', 'Egypt', 'Ireland', 'Egypt', 'Egypt'],Host(s):['Cattle'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Daily News Egypt[1] reports that this keenness came after lifting Egypt\'s ban on the import of Irish meat, which lasted for 20 years because of mad cow disease.<br />The website said that the Egyptian market has an annual demand of 150,000 cattle, predominately serviced by imports from South America.<br />\""Earlier this week, the Department of Agriculture agreed health certificates with Egyptian authorities to allow fattening livestock to be exported to the North African market,\"" said the website., Like Ireland, French authorities agreed on health certificates with Egyptian officials in recent weeks.<br />However, a number of cases of bluetongue have been recorded in France this year, and this could potentially limit the country\'s ability to ship cattle to Egypt.<br />Regarding prices, the website said that Egyptian buyers will be particularly interested in securing Friesian-type cattle for further feeding.],No. of outbreak Sentences:2",Insufficient Metadata,NA,6,,"Spatial Entities---['Egypt', 'Ireland', 'Egypt', 'Ireland', 'Ireland', 'EGYPT', 'Egypt', 'France', 'Ireland', 'France', 'Ireland', 'the North African market.<br', 'Egypt', 'Ireland', 'Egypt', 'Egypt']","Temporal Entities---['20-year', 'August 2017', '20 years', 'annual', 'this week', 'the coming days', '21 days', 'under 12 months of age and', 'this year', '2016', 'March']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['Cattle'],Agent(s):[]",,0.55

Owners will no longer have to keep their birds housed or enclosed in netting, after experts decided the level of risk had reduced. The move will come into effect tomorrow. The Norman family, who farm on the outskirts of Carlisle, said it was \""good news\"", and will be letting all 32,000 of their hens out to roam. \""We just got our hens before the restrictions came into force, so they have never been out,\"" said Elaine Norman. \""It will take them some time to adjust. Hens are creatures of habit and it will take around two weeks to roam properly. But I would rather see them out, then inside all the time.\"" However, strict disease prevention measures and a ban on poultry gatherings will remain in place. This applies to birds including chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, and it is expected this will hit \'fur-and-feather\' shows at some of Cumbria\'s country shows this summer. Thousands of free-range birds were affected by the restrictions imposed by Defra. It meant birds and eggs lost their \'free range\' status temporarily because they had been kept indoors. Sticker boxes were introduced to inform consumers that hens were not free range. David Brass, who owns the Lakes Free Range Egg Company at Stainton, near Penrith, said: \""My hens are going out tomorrow. They have been in a long time, but it has not affected sales of eggs from free-range birds at all. \""It\'s been three weeks since we had an outbreak of the H5N8 avian flu near Haltwhistle.

But two weeks ago they knew it was spring and they have been itching to be let out.\"" Cumbrian MP Tim Farron said the latest scientific advice concluded the level of risk to poultry in high-risk areas had now reduced to the same level as that across the rest of England. \""This is good news for egg-lovers, who can now once again make a meaningful choice about buying locally-produced, free range eggs,\"" he said.

Bird flu cases cause threat to Lancashire egg farmers ( From Lancashire Telegraph ) 
EGG farmers in East Lancashire have said they are facing a serious threat to their businesses following bird flu outbreaks. 
The NFU is urging European officials to extend farmers free-range status if an order to contain livestock to avoid bird flu in the region is continued. 
MORE TOP STORIES: 
An avian influenza prevention zone was declared on December 6 and will remain until February 28. 
It requires owners to keep poultry and captive birds indoors or to take steps to separate them from wild birds, which prevents them from producing free range eggs. 
Farming leaders have said there is a very real prospect that producers could go out of business unless an extension is agreed. 
Last week the H5N8 strain of avian flu was been confirmed in a flock of 10,000 breeding pheasants at Hy-Fly Game Hatcheries Limited in Pilling. 
Days later the strain was also found in a flock of about 1,000 pheasants at another premises nearby. 
Edward Cowperthwaite from Scholfield Farm in Pendleton, Ribble Valley, is wary of the danger of such outbreaks, having seen the effects first hand from past farm diseases. 
He said: `` It might not provide a threat to health, but the business impact it can have could be massive. 
`` Because of the restrictions and contained areas even those who don t suffer the disease first hand are affected, in fact sometimes it can be wore for them. 
`` It s definitely a big worry, it could finish a business off. '' 
A spokesman for the NFU said: `` With this outbreak of avian influenza, we are in uncharted territory and this situation requires new measures that will help to solve the concerns of producers. 
`` If these steps aren t taken to protect the industry, producers are facing the very real prospect that they could go out of business and the UK market will be unable to enjoy the free-range products they demand. 
`` British farmers have been quick to introduce enhanced biosecurity measures and have ensured that the welfare of their birds remains an absolute priority. ''

The department has advised that meat from healthy poultry is safe for consumption as it undergoes strict meat inspection processes at abattoirs.The outbreak comes at a delicate time for the poultry industry, which is struggling against imports.Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 - a rapidly spreading viral disease - was confirmed in a broiler breeder site in Mpumalanga on Thursday last week. It exists naturally in many birds and can be transmitted by coming into contact with infected animals or through ingestion of infected food or water.\""The affected farm has been quarantined and culling of the affected animals has been completed. The department is conducting forward and backward tracing to trace movement of all poultry in and out of the farm in order to establish the source of the influenza.

All provinces have been notified and are on high alert.\"" The department said control measures had been implemented to prevent spread of disease, including a complete standstill of movement of poultry and poultry products on the infected farms. Nothing is allowed to enter or leave the farms. Birds on the infected farms will be slaughtered. \""State vets are conducting inspections starting with all the farms within a 3km and a further 27km (30km) radius around the affected farm to gather information on the health status of the birds. Poultry and poultry products may only move from these farms with a state veterinary permit,\"" the statement said.The department has notified SA\'s trading partners about the outbreak because they require a declaration that the country is free of highly pathogenic avian influenza for trade in fresh poultry meat and unprocessed poultry products. Currently SA is not able to provide this due to the outbreak in Mpumalanga. Exports of processed poultry products, live chickens and fresh products from registered poultry compartments will continue depending on the requirements of the importing countries.

4fcec22968,SD turkey industry recovers from 2015 avian flu outbreak - The Capital Journal,"SD turkey industry recovers from 2015 avian flu outbreak | Local News Stories<br />South Dakota\'s turkey industry has a lot to give thanks for a year after the worst U.S. animal disease outbreak hit many farms in the state.This fall, the state\'s turkey farms and plants are back up and turning out toms and hens like nobody\'s business, a year after the trauma of the avian flu outbreak that led to 640,000 turkeys being killed.Nationwide, about 50 million turkeys and chickens were destroyed in 2015 on 230 farms because of the flu, many of them in Minnesota and Iowa, said Dr. Dustin Oedekoven, South Dakota\'s state veterinarian.<br />\""That was the most expensive and largest animal disease incident in U.S. history,\"" he said, citing a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on it.He figures about 80 percent of his time last year - \""and about 110 percent of my staff\'s time\"" - was spent fighting the outbreak and making sure it didn\'t happen again. \""It was an all-hands on deck, like a fire-fighting operation to try to deal with this.But it paid off, he said.Better security protocols on turkey farms - limiting human visitors to barns is a key plank - will provide more protection against such an outbreak again, he said.An avian flu outbreak in February 2016 in Indiana didn\'t get into South Dakota\'s flocks, probably due to better security and health measures put in place after the 2015 outbreak, Oedekoven said.\""The new protocols and response efforts that were revised after the 2015 outbreak were used in this early 2016 case in Indiana,\"" he told the Capital Journal on Monday. \""As a result, I think we were spared having a great outbreak there.\""And, therefore, having another one in South Dakota linked to the Indiana case, he said.South Dakota raises less than 2 percent of the nation\'s turkeys. But turkey production in the state is uniquely limited to a certain religious and ethnic minority.All the 4.5 million turkeys raised in South Dakota live in barns on about 40 Hutterite colonies.South Dakota doesn\'t lead the nation in turkey production but it does have the most Hutterites.The group came here fleeing persecution in Europe about 125 years ago, a tightly knit group that, like the Amish, keeps to an Old Country language, way of dress and Christian practice.But while conservative and traditional in their cultural and religious practices dating back to the Protestant Reformation in Europe, the Hutterites are progressive agriculturalists, quick to use the best technology and methods, Oedekoven said.They often are leaders, in fact, in trying new farming methods and are widely respected for their success in farming.Their communal way of life also means they have a large labor pool that is very low cost.The way Hutterites organize themselves also fits well into the vertically integrated turkey industry, where the same company that owns the processing plant owns the turkeys during their short lives.It\'s no longer a system of independent farmers raising a flock of turkeys and selling some each year to a buyer or processing plant.For example, South Dakota turkey numbers have gone from 4.9 million in 2001 to about 4.5 million in 2016, about the same level that it\'s been the past decade. Only about 45 Hutterite farms raise them. That\'s about 100,000 per producer. And it all happens in East River country, where the corn and soybeans that feed them are raised.By comparison, in 1939, there were 24,085 turkey farms - or farms with turkeys - in South Dakota raising a total of 1.3 million birds. That was about 54 turkeys per farm; each farm likely also had cattle, sheep, hogs and chickens.In just 10 years, by 1949, only 2,488 farms were producing only 275,000 turkeys; about 135 per farm flock, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Now, the state\'s turkey production is limited not only to a few producers, but to a certain phase of turkey life, too. So there\'s no turkey or egg dilemma.\""We have a turkey feedlot industry in South Dakota,\"" Oedekoven said. \""There are no momma turkeys in South Dakota.\""He means that nobody hatches turkey eggs here, on a commercial basis, but brings in already hatched ones to feed \'em up.They don\'t get much time to relax after hatching, either.Day-old poults are shipped in from out of state - Iowa, Minnesota, Manitoba - and raised in barns here until they are about five months old and ready to be processed. It\'s a short life and means producers can get about 2.5 crops per year.Most of South Dakota\'s turkeys go to Dakota Provisions processing plant in Huron, which is owned by the 40 or so turkey farming Hutterite colonies. The plant makes many products and frozen whole turkeys popular at Thanksgiving aren\'t much of the mix.<br />The Dakota Provisions plant in Huron has meant lots of jobs for immigrants. According to South Dakota Public Radio, 46 percent of the students in the Huron Public School district are of Latino or Asian descent. Up to 600 of the plant\'s employees are Karen people from Myanmar, recruited by the plant owners because the owners can\'t find enough workers otherwise. The pay averages about $13 an hour.Many lost jobs, at least temporarily, in 2015 because of the flu outbreak cutting plant production.But the plant is doing well, a year after the flu outbreak and announced in August it\'s doing $39 million worth of expansion and improvements at its Huron plant.The flu outbreak was devastating for the Hutterite colonies themselves last year, too.\""It was indescribable,\"" Simon Decker, minister of the Spring Lake Hutterite colony near Arlington, told the Mennonite World Review magazine a year ago. \""It still brings out emotion.\""His colony lost $600,000 to $700,000, from losing 65,000 turkeys and 40,000 chickens, Decker said. For the group of 120 people who live communally and work together, as well as live and worship together, such an economic blow hits everyone, he said.But the turkey industry in the state is better able to avoid another such outbreak, Oedekoven says.Oedekoven said the 640,000 turkeys destroyed to stop the flu outbreak were buried or composted on or near the farm where they were raised. Composting meant the carcasses disappeared into the biosphere within three weeks, he said, while burial means it will be longer for them to disappear.The best theories about the cause of the outbreak are that the strain of avian flu that laid waste to so many commercially raised chickens and turkeys in 2015 came from wild migratory birds with Asian connections.How it got into the commercial flocks and barns, isn\'t known, but it could have been humans who tracked it in from wild bird nesting areas not far from poultry farms,he said.Nationwide the industry has bounced back too.U.S. turkeys raised will be up 4 percent this year over 2015, to 243 million, USDA reports.Six states account for nearly two-thirds of the turkey production, led by Minnesota which has 450 farmers who will produce 44 million turkeys, 7 percent more than 2015. North Carolina is second, with 33 million, up 6 percent from 2015,while No. 3 Arkansas is down 5 percent to 26 million, according to USDA.The average American likes turkeys more and more, as a food. Per capita consumption - or \""turkey per capita disappearance,\"" as USDA puts it - has gone from 16 pounds per human head in 2012 to 17 pounds per person this year.",http://www.capjournal.com/news/sd-turkey-industry-recovers-from-avian-flu-outbreak/article_33dbff8e-b074-11e6-adfe-e74db88f0094.html,Capital Journal,SD turkey industry recovers from 2015 avian flu outbreak,South Dakota’s turkey industry has a lot to give thanks for a year after the worst U.S. animal disease outbreak hit many farms in the state.,https://www.capjournal.com/news/sd-turkey-industry-recovers-from-2015-avian-flu-outbreak/article_33dbff8e-b074-11e6-adfe-e74db88f0094.html,article,en,NA,NA,"turkey, farm, agriculture, economics, industry, dustin oedekoven, avian flu, processing plant, south dakota, chicken",14,0.875,451,Accessible,"Location(s):['turkey', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'U.S.', 'turkey', 'Minnesota', 'Iowa', 'U.S. history,\\', 'Indiana', 'there.\\""And', 'South Dakota', 'Indiana', 'South Dakota', 'turkey', 'South Dakota', ""South Dakota doesn\\'t"", 'turkey', 'Europe', 'the Protestant Reformation', 'turkey', 'South Dakota', 'turkey', 'East River', 'South Dakota', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'there\\', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'South Dakota.\\""He', 'turkey', 'Iowa', 'Minnesota', 'Manitoba', 'Huron', 'Huron', 'Myanmar', 'Huron', 'Arlington', 'turkey', 'U.S.', 'turkey', 'Minnesota', 'North Carolina', 'Arkansas'],Host(s):['turkeys', 'chickens', 'turkey', 'human', 'birds', 'cattle', 'humans', 'bird', 'poultry'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[This fall, the state\'s turkey farms and plants are back up and turning out toms and hens like nobody\'s business, a year after the trauma of the avian flu outbreak that led to 640,000 turkeys being killed., Nationwide, about 50 million turkeys and chickens were destroyed in 2015 on 230 farms because of the flu, many of them in Minnesota and Iowa, said Dr. Dustin Oedekoven, South Dakota\'s state veterinarian.<br />\""That was the most expensive and largest animal disease incident in U.S. history,\"" he said, citing a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on it., An avian flu outbreak in February 2016 in Indiana didn\'t get into South Dakota\'s flocks, probably due to better security and health measures put in place after the 2015 outbreak, Oedekoven said.\""The new protocols and response efforts that were revised after the 2015 outbreak were used in this early 2016 case in Indiana,\"" he told the Capital Journal on Monday., \""As a result, I think we were spared having a great outbreak there.\""And, therefore, having another one in South Dakota linked to the Indiana case, he said., U.S. turkeys raised will be up 4 percent this year over 2015, to 243 million, USDA reports.],No. of outbreak Sentences:5",Sufficient Metadata,Capital Journal,11,0.611111111,"Spatial Entities---['turkey', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'U.S.', 'turkey', 'Minnesota', 'Iowa', 'U.S. history,\\', 'Indiana', 'there.\\""And', 'South Dakota', 'Indiana', 'South Dakota', 'turkey', 'South Dakota', ""South Dakota doesn\\'t"", 'turkey', 'Europe', 'the Protestant Reformation', 'turkey', 'South Dakota', 'turkey', 'East River', 'South Dakota', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'there\\', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'South Dakota.\\""He', 'turkey', 'Iowa', 'Minnesota', 'Manitoba', 'Huron', 'Huron', 'Myanmar', 'Huron', 'Arlington', 'turkey', 'U.S.', 'turkey', 'Minnesota', 'North Carolina', 'Arkansas']","Temporal Entities---['2015', 'a year', 'This fall', 'last year - \\""and', 'February 2016', 'this early 2016', 'Monday', 'about 125 years ago', '2001', '2016', 'the past decade', '1939', 'just 10 years', '1949', 'about five months old', 'August', 'last year', 'a year ago', 'three weeks', 'this year', 'more than 2015', '2012']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['turkeys', 'chickens', 'turkey', 'human', 'birds', 'cattle', 'humans', 'bird', 'poultry'],Agent(s):[]",0.67,0.83

36d8e5c133,Export options grow as bird flu infects global poultry products trade - Queensland Country Life,"Export potential as bird flu infects global poultry products trade<br />Bird flu outbreaks in parts of Asia, Europe, and now the US, are creating some optimistic sales prospects for Australian exports in the competitive poultry products market.In the past two months big egg producers Pace Farms and Sunny Queen have moved swiftly to cash in on massive demand in South Korea, where avian influenza has claimed more than 26 million hens since late last year.Others are trying to get a toehold in the Korean market, too, as a normally expensive 30 per cent egg import tariff has temporarily fallen to zero.Brisbane-based Sunny Queen now sends 276,000 eggs (23,000 dozen) a week to Korea in refrigerated shipping containers, sourcing extra supplies from across eastern Australia to support its expanding market.South Korea\'s egg shortage intensified last month after outbreaks of bird flu in four states in the US, prompting Seoul to ban all uncooked US poultry and egg products.Taiwan also banned poultry-related imports from Tennessee, where the highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza was discovered on a poultry farm in early March, and halted poultry meat sales from Wisconsin after an H5 avian flu outbreak.The disease has also been detected in Alabama and Kentucky.Japan and Hong Kong have also imposed restrictions.Given the US is a major egg exporter and the world\'s second biggest poultry meat trader its bird flu problems are potentially helpful news for Australia\'s fledgling chicken meat and egg export sectors.However, global markets are highly price sensitive and, as one industry spokesman noted, chicken meat opportunities have actually become more volatile in many parts of the world as more flu outbreaks emerged in recent years and jittery governments imposed fresh trade barriers.Australia exports just 30,000 tonnes of the 1.15 million tonnes of (carcase weight) chicken meat produced here every year, mostly as offal and feet, to Asia, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific region.Some high-end fresh lines go to niche Asian markets and the United Arab Emirates, but the industry, led by big farmer-processors Inghams and Baiada, generally focuses on a domestic sales growing at 3pc annually.Chicken\'s share of Australia\'s total meat consumption is set to reach 44pc within five years, compared to 25.4pc for beef.Flu-free Brazil dominates the global chicken meat trade, followed by bird flu-troubled USA, and a host of European Union countries where disease issues have also triggered trade restrictions.Bird flu is tipped to cut EU exports by 100,000t in 2017, down to 11.7m tonnes, following import restrictions by South Africa, the Philippines and other key buyers.Thailand, the world\'s fourth-ranked exporter, has jumped at opportunities to sell more chicken meat globally, with its sales climbing near 800,000t last year.Assuming it stays disease-free while neighbours such as Vietnam and Malaysia battle avian flu, Thailand expects exports to rise 4pc in 2017, largely thanks to fresh access to South Korea.Inghams public affairs general manager, Dr Andreas Dubs, said Australian processors exported to about 70 countries, but demand varied and sales opportunities were mostly in their infancy.However, companies such as Inghams may become more strategic about cashing in on Australia\'s reputation as a clean food source if long-term markets could be pinned down.Australian Chicken Meat Federation\'s assistant executive director, Dr Kylie Hewson, said although NSW recorded a short avian influenza outbreak on a free-range farm in 2013, Australia had enjoyed a remarkably clean record, thanks partly to its distance from migrating bird routes crossing infected regions overseas and local biosecurity habits.\""Asia has become a bit of a boiling point lately, but different outbreaks have happened everywhere from Austria to Africa, France, and Italy,\"" she said.\""The World Health Organisation seems more worried, given the number of alerts being routinely published.\""After losing a third of its poultry flock and access to US imports, Korea\'s supply squeeze may lead to an extension of the temporary tariff holiday for Australian eggs past June. \""I\'d be surprised if their shortage doesn\'t last some time,\"" said Sunny Queen\'s managing director, John O\'Hara.The import tariff break had given his company a valued chance to establish its credentials in Korea.\""Maybe they\'ll have a staged return to tariffs, which would help us further build relations with new customers.\""Meanwhile, the Australian Egg Corporation has launched a new Egg Standards of Australia (ESA) voluntary quality assurance program for farms to highlight the quality of production among egg producers complying with the new code.Managing director, Rowan McMonnies, said it would help producers clearly show they met requirements of regulators and customers in hen welfare, egg quality, biosecurity, food safety, work health and safety and environmental management.\""After extensive consultation with egg farmers and

a5da649cb4,"Avian influenza strikes southern states, impacts export markets - Fence Post","Avian influenza strikes southern states, impacts export markets<br />After one commercial poultry flock tested positive for the bird flu in southern Tennessee in March, a second case of the highly pathogenic avian influenza cropped up at another commercial poultry farm located within the infected controlled quarantined zone just a week or so later.<br />Three other cases of the same strain were identified in three northern Alabama counties, too.<br />The first avian influenza case in Tennessee was the nation\'s first such case involving a commercial poultry operation in more than a year. In 2014 and 2015, the highly pathogenic bird flu prompted the death of approximately 50 million birds. <br />Tennessee\'s state veterinarian Charles Hatcher said he wasn\'t surprised by the second outbreak of H7N9 flu in the state. The second infected flock was located just two miles away from the original outbreak site. Additional outbreaks often occur within a quarantined zone, he said. Both flocks that were infected provide poultry to Tyson Foods Inc.<br />All of the current cases in Tennessee and Alabama fall within what\'s called the Mississippi fly zone. The recent outbreaks can be linked to a wild North American bird lineage that carried the strain, said Donna Karlsons, public affairs specialist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.<br />Karlsons said the initial flock in Tennessee showed clinical signs of having avian flu and there was an increase in mysterious deaths within the flock.<br />QUICK RESPONSE<br />Because the producers impacted by this latest outbreak had biosecurity plans in place, the disease was detected and treated quickly. In fact, the commercial producer in Tennessee involved in the first outbreak opted to put down 73,500 birds in his flock without having an official diagnosis from the state veterinarian as a precaution. The second flock had 55,000 birds impacted and culled.<br />\""This producer acted quickly and a quick response can help decrease the amount of virus shed in the environment. The rapid response to HPAI is the result of a concerted federal-state effort focused on emergency response planning and preparedness,\"" Karlsons said. \""APHIS immediately activated a response team to the area. Since the 2014-2015 outbreak, we learned that acting quickly and working together is the most effective response to outbreaks. We\'ve allocated resources and we have equipment ready. For HPAI, we want to put the birds down quickly to minimize the spread of the virus.\""<br />U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian Jack Shere said the sooner the avian flu is detected, the sooner all parties can react to the situation and prevent the spread of the outbreak.<br />\""These farms will continue to be under surveillance for the next 30 to 60 days to prove there\'s no lingering issues,\"" Shere said. <br />Hatcher advised poultry producers to have biosecurity measures in place to protect their flocks. Those precautions include wearing specific clothing in each poultry barn and not from building to building; minimizing access to sanitized equipment and people; preventing wild birds and animals from gaining access to the area around poultry buildings; properly disposing of culled birds and their bedding material; avoiding contact with migratory waterfowl; and sanitizing buildings before new flocks are brought in. <br />No matter how quickly the outbreak is contained, a confirmed case of HPAI makes a dent in the poultry industry. Some countries that import U.S. poultry products have bans in place that are just for the state where the outbreak occurs, while other countries ban all imports from the entire country, Karlsons said. <br />South Korea and Japan are two such countries who have restricted imports after the first case was detected in Tennessee. Lisa Ferguson with the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the U.S. is trying to establish \""forward-looking agreements\"" with other countries to minimize the overall impact on the export-import markets when such an outbreak occurs.<br />\""We would like countries to agree to limit their restrictions to the state level or an even a smaller area. They don\'t need to enact quarantines on the entire country,\"" Ferguson said. <br />Company officials with Tyson said they worked closely with federal and state officials to euthanize the birds from the infected flocks.

On March 14, samples from a commercial flock on a premises less than two miles away also tested positive for the same strain of avian influenza.<br />Once HPAI was detected, the flocks were depopulated and buried and animal health officials established a controlled zone in the 10-kilometer radius of the affected facilities. Poultry movement was restricted within the zone and birds from commercial and backyard flocks were tested weekly for three weeks. No additional samples have tested positive for avian influenza and testing is now complete. Cleaning and disinfection continues at the two affected premises.<br />\""We greatly appreciate the hard work of all involved in this response,\"" said Commissioner of Agriculture Jai Templeton. \""From our staff and partners on the local, state and federal level to the flock owners and all connected to the poultry industry-this was truly a team effort. I certainly hope Tennessee never has to deal with this situation again, but should we face another challenge, I am confident that our state is prepared.\""<br />On March 8, a commercial chicken flock in Giles County tested positive for H7N9 low pathogenic avian influenza. The flock was depopulated and buried and domesticated poultry within a 10-kilometer radius of that premises were also tested and monitored for illness. That surveillance zone was released March 30.<br />Although the Tennessee Department of Agriculture did not prohibit poultry exhibitions, shows or sales during this avian influenza situation, the department issued a poultry health advisory and discouraged commingling of birds. Should avian influenza be detected again in the state, the department may take additional action.<br />Neither HPAI nor LPAI pose a risk to the food supply. No affected animals entered the food chain. Furthermore, the Tennessee Department of Health confirms that the risk of a human becoming ill with avian influenza during poultry illness incidents is very low. This virus is not the same as the China H7N9 virus affecting Asia and is genetically distinct.<br />The primary difference between LPAI and HPAI is mortality rate in domesticated poultry. A slight change to the viral structure can make a virus deadly for birds. Avian influenza virus strains often occur naturally in wild migratory waterfowl without causing illness in those birds.

APHA said it has robust disease surveillance procedures in place and are working closely with the Devolved Administrations and livestock industry.<br />Restriction zones are already in place in France to control the spread of the disease, and if Bluetongue were to be found circulating in the UK, similar measures such as movement restrictions would be put in place in line with our National Control Strategy across the Devolved Administrations.

(WKBT) - The La Crosse County Health Department reports a dead crow found in La Crosse County last month tested positive for West Nile virus.This is the first bird that tested positive for West Nile virus in La Crosse County since surveillance for the mosquito-transmitted virus began May 1, 2018.According to a release from the La Crosse County Health Department, West Nile virus is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire the virus by feeding on infected birds.\""La Crosse County residents should be aware of West Nile virus and take some simple steps to protect themselves against mosquito bites,\"" Rombalski said. \""The best way to avoid the disease is to reduce exposure to and eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\""The La Crosse County of La Crosse Health Department recommends the following: - Limit time spent outside at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.- Apply an insect repellant with DEET, IR3535, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus to exposed skin and clothing.- Make sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquito entry.- Prevent mosquitoes from breeding by removing stagnant water from items around your property, such as tin cans, plastic containers, flower pots, discarded tires, roof gutters, and downspouts.- Turn over wheelbarrows, wading pools, boats, and canoes when not in use.- Change the water in bird baths and pet dishes at least every three days.- Clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers.- Landscape to prevent water from pooling in low-lying areas, and trim tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours.The majority of people (80%) who are infected with West Nile virus do not get sick. Those who do become ill usually experience mild symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle ache, rash, and fatigue. Less than 1% of people infected with the virus get seriously ill with symptoms that include high fever, muscle weakness, stiff neck, disorientation, mental confusion, tremors, confusion, paralysis, and coma. Older adults and those with compromised immune systems are at greater risk of developing central nervous system illness that can be fatal.The La Crosse County Health Department has provided surveillance and treatment of mosquito breeding grounds for more than 3 decades. The program is currently focused on prevention of mosquito-transmitted diseases such as West Nile Virus and La Crosse Encephalitis.The Wisconsin Department of Health Services has monitored the spread of West Nile virus since 2001 among wild birds, horses, mosquitoes, and people. During 2002, the state documented its first human infections and 52 cases were reported that year. During 2017, 51 cases of West Nile virus infection were reported among Wisconsin residents. West Nile virus infections in humans have been reported from June through October; however, most reported becoming ill with West Nile virus in August and September.The Wisconsin Division of Public Health will continue surveillance for West Nile virus until the end of the mosquito season.

6f69341f71,The First Word My 4-Year-Old Learned This Summer Was \'Lynching\': Why I Thought It Was Important to Take My ... - The 74,"The First Word My 4-Year-Old Learned This Summer Was \'Lynching\': Why I Thought It Was Important to Take My Preschooler to Montgomery<br />Bekah McNeel<br />This essay first appeared on The Hall Monitor Blog<br />The first word my 4-year-old learned this summer was \""lynching.\""<br />I took her on a road trip from our home in San Antonio, Texas, to Montgomery, Alabama, to see the Memorial for Peace and Justice. It\'s a stunning, six-acre immersive memorial dedicated to the 4,400-plus victims of lynching in the United States. Since it opened in April, I had been trying to find a few days to escape and see it. The opportunity presented itself, and there was an extra seat in the car. So I took my daughter.<br />There were a lot of reasons not to take her along on my trip. Thirteen hours in the car. The insane heat wave rolling through the South. The likelihood that she would see or hear something too macabre for her tender psyche, never recover, and live out her days resenting me. Or worse, spend the next year sleeping in my bed.<br />There was also the white anxiety to contend with. Because I\'m a journalist, I can usually see a comment section in my head. The terms \""inappropriate,\"" \""values signaling,\"" \""white guilt,\"" \""bad parent,\"" \""irresponsible,\"" and about 100 other criticisms roiled in my brain as we packed the car.<br />But there was one important reason to make the trip, and that reason won out. It\'s the same reason we take our kids to aquariums, to natural history museums, and to church: to engage their minds and souls in things that matter, and to show them the truth.<br />My kids\' family tree is speckled with white, Southern landowners. Some were slave owners. Some were members of the KKK. Many were genuinely good folks, but all were part of a system of racial oppression that lingers today. If we never tell our children this part of their story, if we continue the tradition of glorifying our ancestors and their order, we do them a disservice. We leave them to get \""woke,\"" without a guarantee that it will happen or do any good.<br />So I got over myself and hopped in the car.<br />The 13 hours in the car were broken up by stops along the way to observe the beauty of the South. We stopped in Thibodeaux, Louisiana, where an old friend let us pick tomatoes from the vine and pet some goats.<br />We stopped for a dip in the Gulf in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, where the bathwater tides were just fine for my girl and the sandbars stretched beyond where we could walk. We engaged in some unparalleled front-porch-sittin\' with our co-pilot\'s great aunt in Pascagoula, Mississippi.<br />We sang along to John Prine\'s \""Angel From Montgomery.\"" My daughter knows all the words to that song, and I have no idea what she was expecting from the city, but I\'m sure it was grand.<br />In Montgomery, we were walking along the riverfront when my daughter found a stick. A long, straight stick, perfect for casting spells and drawing in the sand.<br />As we walked, I explained what we were about to see at the memorial. She dragged her stick, holding my hand.<br />Bekah McNeel<br />She\'s pretty clear on death, even at 4. The deaths of pets and great-grandparents have given her an adequate primer.<br />Being 4, she\'s more confused by the racial terms \""white\"" and \""black\"" - given that those are not the actual colors of our skin - and so, if you ask, she will define lynching as \""when people with light skin come and take away people with dark skin and kill them.\""<br />Once we were clear on the definition, I saw the clouds roll in across her little brow. She dropped my hand and spun toward me.<br />\""If anyone tries to lynch people, I will fight them away with this stick,\"" she exclaimed, waving said stick in my face.<br />That anger ... that\'s what I was going for on this trip. I didn\'t acknowledge my privilege until adulthood, and sometimes when I feel the spear of justice begin to press against my heart, I recoil in fear, instead of leaning harder into it. Sometimes I can\'t bear the shame.<br />Our kids could be different. Instead of developing their tribal loyalty first, and then later trying to bend history to fit the narrative of the kindly slave owner, what if we started with moral foundations? What if they learned about history and society with their eyes open, without being on the defense? Then, when they place themselves in context, maybe they\'ll have a clearer path forward.<br />When she buys a house, maybe she won\'t think twice about leaving her \""safe\"" zip code. When she takes a job, maybe she\'ll think about equity instead of striving to lock up her privilege. When she encounters opportunities to help, maybe she\'ll ask better questions and give of herself with fewer self-congratulations.<br />Bekah McNeel<br />So, the stick came with us to the memorial. My daughter wanted to use it to free the people in Kwame Akoto-Bamfo\'s evocative sculpture, the first representative image visitors encounter upon entering the memorial.<br />So we talked about slavery, how \""no one should buy people.\""<br />We sat for a long time, absorbing the intensity of the art while an umbrella, loaned by the memorial, shielded our pinkening skin from the intensity of the sun.<br />We moved on; we took a break from talking about the sadness, and just admired the loveliness of the place.<br />Bekah McNeel<br />The memorial itself is beautiful and terrible, perched on a treeless hill, its roofline jutting out into the sky like an elbow thrown into the ribs of our national apathy. Hanging below that bold angle, 800 pillars bear the names of counties and states, and below the places are the names of the victims. Some plaques along the wall told stories, linking them to specific places.<br />In 1887, in Thibodeaux, the same place where we picked tomatoes, dozens of black field workers were lynched for protesting low wages.<br />Some quick research revealed that none of the stops on our vacation were without a story. Our road trip, like our family tree, was knotted and gnarled with this collective injustice.<br />In 1901, in Ocean Springs, where we had dipped in the Gulf, Warren Stuart was lynched on the accusation that he had assaulted a white woman.<br />The front porch we enjoyed in Pascagoula sits next door to the Longfellow House, built by notoriously cruel slave trader Daniel Smith Graham.<br />Our home, Bexar County, had a pillar hanging in the memorial. It is for Alexander Washington, a man lynched for alleged attempted rape in 1886. The papers at the time reported that the black community supported the lynching, and that \""no attempt was being made to discover the parties who did the hanging.\"" The second statement is probably accurate, and the first is probably far more complicated, if not a blatant lie.<br />Which led to some reflection on the complicity of the press, and wondering what we will look back on in 50 years and feel ashamed to have printed.<br />While I walked and read among the Corten steel pillars hanging in the memorial, my daughter used her stick to draw in the dust and gravel along the edge where the roofline cast a shadow in the morning sun. She was getting peckish and tired, and her goodwill was waning. I know her limits, physically and psychologically. To avoid a scene, I let her stay in the shaded gravel.<br />A docent stood near her, a young, black woman wearing an Equal Justice Initiative T-shirt. I felt, again, that sticky white-person awkwardness, wondering if we came off as cavalier, my daughter sitting contentedly at the edge of a structure memorializing the cruelty her ancestors visited upon the ancestors of this docent. Was it offensive? Was it annoying? Was it entitled, or privileged, or tone-deaf?<br />When I came to retrieve my daughter a few minutes later, my face must have been battle-ready, because the docent held up her hand to say, Stand down, Mama.<br />\""She\'s been working hard to make something for you,\"" the docent said, cuing me to change my tone. My daughter proudly showed me the gravel etchings she\'d been working on.<br />\""She is so special,\"" the docent said. She told me what they had been discussing in my absence. Just two humans, enjoying the shade on a hot day. Even with history literally hanging over their heads, there was so much grace. Grace that made space for hope.<br />The memorial alludes to hope as well, in the Dana King sculptures of the women of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Which led us to explore this idea of segregation ... and desegregation.<br />After the memorial, we visited the Freedom Riders Museum. This was a chance to help my daughter understand nonviolent action and a role \""people with light skin\"" might play in supporting \""people with dark skin\"" in their continuing movement toward justice. Not to make it about us - but to make sure we aren\'t trying to rebuild what they\'re tearing down. These historic and present leaders showed my daughter (and her mama) that it\'s not up to her to wield a stick and save the world. Instead of paralyzing shame or panicky world-saving frenzy of white-person wokeness, the white Freedom Riders suggested we consider stubborn, humble solidarity.

5c72ffbd3d,China\'s early African swine fever cases due to kitchen waste feeding - Reuters,"China blames feeding kitchen waste to pigs for African swine fever spread<br />BEIJING (Reuters) - China\'s agriculture ministry said on Wednesday it would ban the feeding of kitchen waste to pigs after linking the practice to the majority of the early cases of African swine fever. FILE PHOTO: Pigs are pictured at a farm on the outskirts of Kunming, capital of southwest China\'s Yunnan province November 30, 2011. REUTERS/Jason Lee/File PhotoThe statement from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs is the government\'s first comment on how the deadly disease has spread in the world\'s top pork producer. China has reported more than 40 outbreaks of the highly contagious disease since early August, with farms across 12 provinces and municipalities already infected. It does not affect humans. Beijing has not yet said how the disease first entered the country but the ministry found 62 percent of the first 21 outbreaks were related to the feeding of kitchen waste, a statement published on its website said. \""These outbreaks were mostly located in urban-rural boundaries, and were particularly evident in several cases in early September in Anhui province,\"" the statement said. Anhui is an eastern province whose capital Hefei is located about 415 km (258 miles) west of Shanghai. The virus was also detected in kitchen waste fed to pigs on a farm in the Inner Mongolia region, it added. \""After the provinces with outbreaks and neighboring provinces completely banned feeding of kitchen waste to pigs, the epidemic was greatly reduced, which fully demonstrates the importance of completely prohibiting the feeding of waste,\"" the statement said. Kitchen waste or swill is widely used in China to feed hogs, particularly by small farmers, as it is cheaper than manufactured pig feed. Regulations require that the swill must be heated to a certain temperature before being consumed but industry experts say that step is often skipped. The ministry also said in the statement it will set up a registration system for vehicles transporting live hogs, poultry and other livestock to control the spread of the disease better. The long distance transport of live hogs has been the main channel for transmitting African swine fever across different regions, it said. Vehicles transporting pigs and other animals will also no longer be allowed to use the \""green channel\"" for priority on roads that is normally permitted for the trucking of fresh produce, added the ministry. It called for more slaughtering closer to farms and the use of refrigerated transportation to better manage the supply of livestock across different regions. China has promoted construction of new farms in the north-east in recent years, closer to its grain supplies. But the policy, which has not yet been accompanied by investment in new slaughterhouses, has led to large numbers of pigs being trucked long distances south.

W. Fenwick, Editor<br />DOI: 10.1128/JCM.00717-15<br />ABSTRACTDermatitis, pyrexia, and hemorrhagic syndrome (DPHS) is a rare bovine syndrome of unclear etiology. We describe two DPHS cases, the first to occur in Italy, with clinicopathological findings suggesting a potential pathogenetic role of bovine herpesvirus-4 (BoHV-4).CASE REPORTTwo Italian Holstein-Friesian cows, 5 and 6 years old, from the same herd were referred to the Teaching Hospital of the Department of Veterinary Science of Turin University because of acute onset of pyrexia, pruritus, and skin lesions. One animal (cow A) was referred 1 week after the onset of clinical signs and displayed forced decubitus; the other animal (cow B) was referred 36 h after the onset of clinical signs. Both animals were anorectic, showed signs of depressed mental status, with decreased/absent milk production, pyrexia (rectal temperature, >41.0°C), and disseminated pruritic papulocrustous dermatitis of the head, neck, tail, perineum, and udder (Fig. 1A to C). In addition, cow B presented hemorrhagic suffusion of the vulvar mucosal membrane (Fig. 1D) and bloody diarrhea.FIG 1 Clinical features observed in two dairy cows with dermatitis, pyrexia, and hemorrhagic syndrome. (A) Severe alopecic erythematous crusty skin lesions disseminated on the head; (B) severe alopecic and erythematous skin lesions on the ventral abdomen and udder; (C) severe alopecia of the tail; (D) hemorrhagic suffusion involving the vulvar mucosa.In cow A, the complete blood cell count (ADVIA 120 hematology system; Bayer) was unremarkable. In cow B, the hematological parameters were significantly altered: severe leukopenia (white blood cell count, 2,680 cells/ml [reference range, 6,200 to 13,600 cells/ml]), lymphopenia (2,004 cells/ml [reference range, 4,000 to 9,800 cells/ml]), neutropenia (390 cells/ml [reference range, 1,100 to 3,600 cells/ml]), monocytopenia (160 cells/ml [reference range, 200 to 1,300 cells/ml]), and thrombocytopenia (190,000 cells/ml [reference range, 412,000 to 1,000,030 cells/ml]). The biochemical profile (Cobas Mira; ABX Diagnostics) was consistent with muscular damage subsequent to forced decubitus in cow A (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], 500 IU [reference range, 47 to 127 IU]; creatine kinase [CK], 15,810 IU [reference range, 105 to 409 IU]; and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], 8,910 IU [reference range, 2,866 to 3,600 IU]). The biochemical profile in cow B was unremarkable.Serological investigations showed antibody (Ab) titers of 3+ and 2+ for bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) (PrimaCheck bovine respiratory syncytial virus [BRSV] Ab; Agrolabo) in cow A and cow B, respectively. No serum antibodies for BoHV-1, bovine BoHV-2, BoHV-5, bovine virus diarrhea/mucosal disease (BVD/MD), parainfluenza 3 virus (PI3), BRSV, pseudorabies virus (PrV), Mycoplasma spp., or Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis were detected in either animal.Parasitological and mycological investigations of the skin and hair samples were negative in both animals.Cow A was euthanized for animal welfare reasons; cow B died spontaneously after 8 days despite supportive treatment. Gross examination revealed multifocal whitish areas involving the renal cortex in both animals; subcutaneous hematomas and severe multifocal hemorrhages of the intercostal muscles were noted in cow B (Fig. 2A). The major histopathological findings for both animals were cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (Fig. 2B) associated with superficial and deep dermatitis, hyperkeratosis (Fig. 2C), and subepidermal separations and ulcerations, in addition to chronic interstitial nephritis associated with vasculitis (Fig. 2D). Severe and diffuse splenic depletion associated with histiocytic giant cells and neutrophilic infiltrates and minimal multifocal interstitial pneumonia were observed in cow B.FIG 2 Gross and histopathological lesions observed in the two dairy cows with clinical signs of dermatitis, pyrexia, and hemorrhagic syndrome. (A) Severe multifocal hemorrhages of the intercostal muscles. (B) Skin sample showing acute leukocytoclastic vasculitis characterized by neutrophilic infiltrates (arrows) also involving the wall of small vessels (asterisks). Magnification of hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain, 20×. (C) Skin sample showing chronic dermatitis characterized by heterogeneous inflammation involving the dermis (asterisk) and vessels (arrow) accompanied by hyperkeratosis (arrowhead). Magnification of HE stain, 10×. (D) Kidney sample showing chronic interstitial nephritis characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates around glomeruli (arrowhead) and tubules (arrow). Magnification of HE stain, 10×.Bacteriological examination and indirect immunofluorescence testing (IIFT) for anti-bovine IgG in skin, lung, kidney, liver, spleen, and heart tissue samples were negative. Toxicological investigations (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and high-performance liquid chromatography) of feed and rumen contents were negative for mycotoxins (citrinin; total fumonisins; aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2; zearalenone; and deoxynivalenol); herd history excluded the use of di-ureido isobutane (DUIB) and other potential toxic feed additives.Virus isolation procedures on the spleen and lung tissue samples were performed. Briefly, homogenates of fresh tissue samples were prepared and inoculated into confluent monolayers of Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) (ATCC CCL-22) cells. Interestingly, a strong rapid cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed 16 h postinoculation; the slides were then stained with anti-BoHV-4 conjugate (75 ?l/well) for 30 min at 37°C in a humidified chamber. In addition, 300 ?l of the MDBK cell culture supernatant, previously showing CPE to virus isolation, was extracted using a PureLink genomic DNA minikit (Promega). Amplification of a region of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene was obtained by pan-herpesvirus-nested PCR assay using degenerate consensus primers (1). Direct immunofluorescence was negative for BVD/MD, BRSV, ovine herpesvirus 2 (OHV-2), and blue tongue virus (BTV) but showed a signal for BoHV-4. Nested PCR gave amplicons of expected sizes (from 215 to 315 bp) that were directly sequenced on an ABI 3130 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies). BLAST analysis revealed maximum identity with published BoHV-4 sequences. In addition, electron microscopy showed herpesvirus-like particles in all the cell cultures inoculated with the lung and spleen samples. The numbers of virus particles varied depending on the sample, with a higher number found in the spleen samples.Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the glycoprotein B (gB) and thymidine kinase (TK) genes of BoHV-4. Amplification was carried out on samples that were positive by pan-herpesvirus diagnostic PCR employing the nested-PCR protocols described by Wellenberg et al. (2) for gB and Verna et al. (3) for TK. PCR products of the expected sizes were obtained during the first amplification round for both gene targets and directly sequenced on an ABI 3130 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies). The sequences retrieved from all samples were identical and used to create a representative consensus sequence. The newly generated consensus and BoHV-4 sequences available in GenBank were aligned using BioEdit. Nucleotide substitution models were evaluated using jModelTest2 (4), and the best model was selected according to Akaike information criterion analysis. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA; version 6) was used for calculating P distance matrices, and phylogeny inference was used according to the maximum-likelihood criterion. The nucleotide substitution model was set according to jModelTest2 output, and evolutionary distances for both data sets were calculated using the Jukes-Cantor model. The robustness of the hypothesis was tested in 1,000 nonparametric bootstrap analyses. Determination of sequence similarity based on nucleotide homology revealed that the analyzed gene regions of the detected BoHV-4 isolate shared a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity with known BoHV-4 sequences, 97.9 to 100% (gB) and 96.3 to 100% (TK), except with four gB sequences detected in Turkey in 2009 to 2011, which showed much lower values (71.3%).We detected no unique amino acid changes in our isolate for both the predicted partial gB and TK proteins in a comparison with sequences in GenBank. Phylogenetic trees based on the aligned nucleotide sequences of BoHV-4 gB and TK genes are shown in Fig. 3.FIG 3 Phylogeny inferred by maximum-likelihood analysis obtained by alignment of 335 nucleotides covering the partial glycoprotein B (gB) gene region of BoHV-4 (A) and 200 nucleotides covering the partial thymidine kinase (TK) gene region of BoHV-4 (B). The phylogenetic tree includes the novel BoHV-4 isolate (TO-1, red rhombus) and sequences available in GenBank. Country of origin and collection date, when available, are indicated together with the accession number for each sequence. Bootstrap (1,000 replicates) values of >50 are shown at the internal nodes. The length of each pair of branches represents the distance between sequence pairs. The scale bar represents the percentage of nucleotide differences.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of dermatitis, pyrexia, and hemorrhagic syndrome (DPHS) in Italy. The clinical signs and histopathological lesions in both cows resembled those previously described in dairy cows affected by the syndrome (5-10). Although its etiology is still unclear, citrinin mycotoxicosis (5, 11) or di-ureido isobutane (DUIB) poisoning (6) has been suggested as a potential cause. Toxic causes were excluded in the present cases. The clinicopathological findings suggested a potential pathogenetic role of BoHV-4. Indeed, published data, the complete blood cell count of cow B, electron microscopy, and viral isolation results from the lungs and spleens of both animals all suggested an active viral infection (12-15).Moreover, vasculitis has been reported as a consequence of systemic herpesvirus infections caused by malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) (16) and BoHV-4 (17), and bovine endothelial cell cultures were found to be susceptible to BoHV-4 infection (18). Although the pathogenesis of vasculitis remains unsolved, it is usually assumed that a small fraction of infected lymphocytes induces the proliferation and deregulation of uninfected cells with a nonspecific cytotoxic effect (19). In the present cases, both electron microscopy and viral culture of skin samples were negative, consistent with previous observations in cases of cutaneous MCF, in which viral particle detection and viral antigen expression in skin samples may be limited (19). Furthermore, BoHV-4 has been isolated from cattle with a variety of inflammatory lesions, such as mammary pustular dermatitis, metritis, pneumonia, diarrhea, respiratory infections, interdigital dermatitis, and vaginitis (20-23).We carried out phylogenetic analyses on partial gB and TK nucleotide sequences of BoHV-4. The gB analysis (Fig. 3A) showed that the BoHV-4 sequence locates within a major cluster with other GenBank sequences from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Brazil, and Turkey, confirming that this region of gB is quite conserved among BoHV-4 strains (24) and, therefore, not helpful in providing clues about their geographical origin. Of note, four Turkish isolates published in GenBank diverge from the major cluster into a separate branch, though they do not carry differences at the amino acid level. Phylogeny based on TK sequences revealed that the BoHV-4 sequence identified in this study clustered within genotype 1, without significant divergence from other known strains. Figure 3B illustrates the main clusters corresponding to the proposed genotypes, 1, 2, and 3, that include European (Mover-like, genotype 1) and American strains isolated from bison and cat, the African strain isolated from buffalo (DN599-like, genotype 2), and Argentinean and Brazilian strains (genotype 3) from bovine (3, 25).The clinicopathological findings were suggestive of an active BoHV-4 infection; however, molecular characterization of other field isolates and broadening of the spectrum of BoHV-4 phylogenetic targets are needed to clarify BoHV-4\'s role in the pathogenesis of DPHS syndrome.Nucleotide sequence accession numbers.Sequences reported in this study were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers KT166423 and KT166424.FOOTNOTESReceived 17 March 2015.Returned for modification 4 April 2015.Accepted 27 May 2015.Accepted manuscript posted online 3 June 2015.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

H5N6 has been linked to 17 human illnesses, all in China. Earlier this year, Myanmar and Taiwan reported their first H5N6 outbreaks in birds, marking increased spread of the virus in Asia.Manny Pinol, the Philippines\' agriculture secretary, said culling has been completed at outbreak sites in Pampanga and Nueva Ecija provinces, both located on Luzon, the country\'s largest island.Arlene Vytiaco, with the country\'s Bureau of Animal Industry, said no workers on the affected poultry farms have showed signs of illness.Outbreaks in South Africa, Italy, TaiwanOn the heels of recent H5N8 outbreaks in poultry, South Africa reported three new H5N8 events involving poultry and an ibis, according to an Aug 22 report from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).Start dates for the events range from Aug 12 to Aug 15. One of the outbreaks involved backyard hobby ducks and swans in newly affected North West province, killing 5 of 62 susceptible birds.The other two outbreaks occurred in different cities in already-affected Gauteng province. One involved backyard white geese, with the virus killing 19 of 34 birds. The other involved a sacred ibis found dead.Meanwhile, Italy over the past 2 days has reported four more highly pathogenic H5 outbreaks, according to statements from an Italian reference lab translated and posted today by AFD.Yesterday the lab said two more H5 outbreaks have been tested at commercial turkey farms, both in Veneto region.On Aug 22 the lab reported two more outbreaks, one involving an H5 virus at a turkey farm in Veneto region and one linked to H5N8 at a game bird farm in Lombardy region.After a surge of H5N8 outbreaks in the winter and spring in Europe, detections have decreased to just sporadic reports, except for Italy, which has continued to report a steady stream of outbreaks in poultry, mostly turkeys.In Taiwan, agriculture officials today reported a highly pathogenic H5N2 outbreak at a commercial farm housing native chickens in Yunlin County.

(Representational Image)Karachi:  A possible outbreak of the Congo fever in Pakistan\'s Sindh province has triggered fear among residents and health officials ahead of Eid next month after five people died due to the virus in a month.The most recent death happened yesterday when a cattle trader from Bahawalpur died of the Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), commonly known as the Congo fever, in Karachi.The CCHF is a tick-borne viral disease. Allah Ditta, 22, had come to Karachi to sell animals for sacrifice for next month\'s Eid-ul Azha. His was the fifth death in Karachi due to the virus in the past month.Mr Ditta was admitted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre on Wednesday and died on yesterday while he was being treated. He had high fever for seven days with gum and nose bleeding, and bruises on his hands for two days.Following Mr Ditta\'s death, Karachi administration has issued notices to the Deputy Commissioner Malir town and the supervisor of the animal market on Karachi\'s outskirts to screen all animals for deadly ticks that carry the virus.A Sindh government spokesman said all animals in the market will be screened before being cleared for trading.The animal market is considered the biggest in Asia with hundreds of thousands of sacrificial animals brought from all over Pakistan by traders and dealers ahead of Eid-ul Azha.Dr Zafar Mehdi, of the government facility for prevention of naegleria and CCHF, said: Mr Ditta\'s was the third death due to the virus in the past three weeks.A week before that, a 65-year-old man from Afghanistan died while a doctor from Bahawalpur has also died. The doctor contracted CCHF while treating a patient in Bahawalpur.The provincial health ministry has asked authorities to cordon off the market area where Mr Ditta had put his livestock.Authorities have begun setting up isolation wards at all government and private hospitals following Mr Ditta\'s death.The CCHF, endemic in Africa, Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, and is commonly known as Congo fever.",http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistans-sindh-braces-for-possible-congo-fever-outbreak-after-5-deaths-in-a-month-1446455,NDTV.com,Pakistan's Sindh Braces For Possible Congo Fever Outbreak After 5 Deaths In A Month,A possible outbreak of the Congo fever in Pakistan's Sindh province has triggered fear among residents and health officials ahead of next month's Eid after five people died due to the virus in a month.,ndtvhd://news/ndtv.com/news/view/ndtv/1446455/site=classic/,article,NA,NA,NA,"congo fever in pakistan,congo fever,pakistan sindh,tick-borne disease,congo fever deaths",13,0.8125,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Congo', 'Sindh', 'Congo', 'Karachi', 'Karachi', 'Sindh', 'Asia', 'Pakistan', 'naegleria', 'Afghanistan', 'Bahawalpur', 'Africa', 'Balkans', 'the Middle East', 'Congo'],Host(s):['cattle'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Pakistan\'s Sindh Braces For Possible Congo Fever Outbreak After 5 Deaths In A Month - NDTV.Pakistan\'s Sindh Braces For Possible Congo Fever Outbreak After 5 Deaths In A Month<br />Congo fever is a tick-borne viral disease., (Representational Image)Karachi:  A possible outbreak of the Congo fever in Pakistan\'s Sindh province has triggered fear among residents and health officials ahead of Eid next month after five people died due to the virus in a month., The most recent death happened yesterday when a cattle trader from Bahawalpur died of the Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), commonly known as the Congo fever, in Karachi., His was the fifth death in Karachi due to the virus in the past month., Mr Ditta was admitted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre on Wednesday and died on yesterday while he was being treated., Following Mr Ditta\'s death, Karachi administration has issued notices to the Deputy Commissioner Malir town and the supervisor of the animal market on Karachi\'s outskirts to screen all animals for deadly ticks that carry the virus., Dr Zafar Mehdi, of the government facility for prevention of naegleria and CCHF, said: Mr Ditta\'s was the third death due to the virus in the past three weeks., A week before that, a 65-year-old man from Afghanistan died while a doctor from Bahawalpur has also died., Authorities have begun setting up isolation wards at all government and private hospitals following Mr Ditta\'s death.],No. of outbreak Sentences:9",Insufficient Metadata,NDTV.com,9,0.5,"Spatial Entities---['Congo', 'Sindh', 'Congo', 'Karachi', 'Karachi', 'Sindh', 'Asia', 'Pakistan', 'naegleria', 'Afghanistan', 'Bahawalpur', 'Africa', 'Balkans', 'the Middle East', 'Congo']","Temporal Entities---['A Month', 'Eid next month', 'yesterday', '22', 'the past month', 'Wednesday', 'seven days', 'two days', 'the past three weeks', 'A week', '65-year-old']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['cattle'],Agent(s):[]",0.69,0.73

472c5229da,"Train employees, others before livestock disease outbreaks occur - Marshfield Mail (subscription)","Train employees, others before livestock disease outbreaks occur<br />One small breach of protocol can lead to a disease outbreak and financial loss for livestock producers.<br />An MU Extension team teaches livestock producers throughout Missouri to follow protocols that protect animal and human health, food and the environment.<br />The team recently received USDA Extension Education funding to offer a series of biosecurity workshops in Missouri.<br />Prevention of disease outbreaks saves animal lives and money, according to Joe Zulovich, principal investigator on the grant. Training staff and putting protocols in place can prevent or reduce losses.<br />The first step is to assess risks by reviewing workflow and traffic flow across farm and barn boundaries, says Zulovich.<br />Biosecurity begins with creation of \""clean zones\"" and \""dirty zones,\"" he said.<br />Livestock producers should create clearly defined boundaries inside and outside of the farm to prevent visitors and workers from carrying disease directly into areas where animals live.<br />Restricted access to the farm and buildings creates a buffer of protection to animals. Post warning signs at farm entrances and buildings where animals live, Zulovich said. Train employees, service personnel such as delivery drivers, and general visitors to break the chain of contamination. Keep supplies such as soap, sanitizer and plastic boots readily available to visitors.<br />Workers and approved visitors should wear clean, site-specific booties and clothing to prevent the spread of disease into animal-raising areas. People can carry disease on their boots, clothing, supplies, equipment and other objects. It can be airborne or brought in through animal food and water. Rodents, pests and birds also create risks.<br />Some systems require workers to shower on-site before entering the clean zone, and again when leaving the clean zone.<br />Establish barriers that limit access to the farm. Examine the workflow of your farm to consider openings where disease can come in. Restrict feed trucks by placing feed bins close to a perimeter fence, Zulovich says. Arrange for packages to be delivered off-site.<br />Zulovich says most swine and poultry producers have good systems in place. The challenge is in getting employees to follow the rules. Disease risk increases when employees do not strictly follow protocol at all times.<br />\""Make sure you train your employees,\"" said Teng Lim, co-principal investigator on the USDA grant. \""Details matter.\"" He urges producers to establish a written plan for training and response. Test and audit the plan on a regular basis, he says.<br />The materials presented in the workshops can be found at faculty.missouri.edu/limt/Biosecurity.shtml[1]. The webpage includes a short animated video illustrating the biosecurity checklist. The video can be used for quick reminders or in-house training, Lim said.<br />Producers should be on the lookout for disease presence, especially when other states and countries report disease. Producers should alert the state veterinarian when they see unusual symptoms or unexplained death losses in their herds or flocks, or when there is any suspicion of foreign animal disease. Contact the state veterinarian immediately when a mass mortality occurs due to disease, Zulovich said.<br />The state of Missouri requires that all animal mortalities be disposed of within 24 hours. MU Extension serves in an advisory role to the state veterinarian when there is a mass mortality. The MU Extension publication \""Composting Dead Swine\"" (WQ351) is available for download at extension.missouri.edu/p/WQ351[2]. \""The Feasibility of Ruminant Composting\"" is available at agebb.missouri.edu/commag/resources[3].<br />When a disease outbreak happens, the most feasible option may be burning or composting dead animals on-farm. Mortality composters are large, heated drums that rotate similarly to a concrete mixer.<br />In recent years, Missouri poultry producers have faced outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Seneca Valley virus are among the diseases found in Missouri in the last two decades.<br />Zulovich and Lim recommend that producers review biosecurity protocols before an outbreak occurs. \""Plan ahead,\"" Lim said.<br />Leading swine industry experts will discuss diseases at the Swine Health Symposium in Sedalia.

6493904c45,Indonesia on track to combat bird flu - Jakarta Post,"Indonesia on track to combat bird flu<br />Amid a rise in bird flu cases among fowls this year, the government confirms there have been no indications of human cases.  \""People should report [to the government] any cases of mass deaths of flocks of birds. Farmers are also urged to conduct proper bio-security procedures and vaccination,\"" Muhammad Azhar, the coordinator of the avian influenza quick control unit at the Agriculture Ministry, said recently.He explained that by conducting the preventive procedures, farmers could remain safe from the risk of avian influenza (AI) transmission. One simple measures, he said, was constructing a fence or wall to limit birds\' direct contact with the outside environment.The ministry has also encouraged farmers to implement a proper vaccination program. This includes using legal vaccine products from the Agriculture Ministry, giving vaccines according to the proper schedule and using clean equipment during the vaccination process.Data from the ministry in the first quarter of this year show that the 8,574 small and medium commercial farms in 10 provinces that received technical supervision and direction from the government recorded no cases of bird flu.The Agriculture Ministry has also collaborated with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the fight against bird flu. Live bird market surveillance was conducted to monitor avian influenza virus in live bird markets in large cities such as Greater Jakarta, Surabaya and Medan beginning in 2009. For instance, environmental samples were taken from markets selling live poultry or slaughtering poultry on-site.\""LBM surveillance is important to monitor the dynamics of AI viruses,\"" said James McGrane, the team leader of the FAO Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases Indonesia. With continuous effort and collaboration, the trend of bird flu cases that affected birds has dropped significantly from year to year, Azhar said.The ministry recorded 2,751 cases of avian influenza in birds in 2007. Four years later, the number dropped to 1,390 cases. In the first quarter of this year, the number stood at 188.The number of cases recorded until July, however, showed a slight increase compared with 123 cases recorded in 2015 due to extreme weather during the transitional period between the rainy and dry seasons in March and April, which decreases the poultry\'s resistance to disease, he explained.Most of the cases of bird flu this year occurred in West Java, followed by Lampung and South Sulawesi. Some of the most recent cases happened in Sidrap, South Sulawesi, in which 26,931 ducks died, and in Banyuwangi, in which 1,600 chickens and ducks died.  McGrane said the higher number of outbreaks in poultry might have been the result of a prior decrease in bird flu cases, which reduced farmers\' awareness of the threat.\""Moreover, knowledge of improved poultry husbandry is still low in backyard poultry farms,\"" he said, adding that in commercial poultry farms, awareness of correct and effective vaccination practices and farm bio-security still needed constant improvement.In order to prevent bird flu in birds from spreading to humans, the Health Ministry is striving continuously to educate the public about bird flu, its modes of transmission and ways to prevent its transmission, ministry Director General for Disease Control Mohamad Subuh said. \""This year, no cases of bird flu affecting humans have been recorded yet,\"" he said, adding that the number of cases had fallen from two deaths recorded in 2015.With a target of seeing the country free of bird flu by 2020, the Health Ministry said it would strengthen the joint efforts involving all related sectors including the Agriculture Ministry, FAO and the community.

1ece7a37a7,Health Alert: Monmouth County Tick-borne Diseases Lab Identifies New Tick Found in Hunterdon County - TAPinto.net,"Health Alert: Monmouth County Tick-borne Diseases Lab Identifies New Tick Found in Hunterdon County - Holmdel & Colts Neck NJ News<br />MONMOUTH COUNTY, N.J. - An exotic East Asian tick, also known as the longhorned tick or bush tick, was found on a farm in Hunterdon County on Nov. 9.<br />On Nov. 21, New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher announced the United States Department of Agriculture\'s National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa confirmed the tick\'s species. Initial identification was made by the Monmouth County Tick-borne Diseases Lab, located at Rutgers University and the Hunterdon County Division of Health. This tick was not known to be present in the U.S., although there are records of at least a dozen previous collections of this species in the country on animals and materials presented for entry at U.S. ports.<br />The species is dark brown in color and grows to the size of a pea when fully engorged. Both larval and nymphal stages are very small and difficult to observe with the naked eye. Adult ticks are seen mainly during early summer, larvae from late summer to early winter, and nymphs mainly in the spring.Sign Up for E-News[1]<br />This tick is a serious pest to livestock (including cattle, horses, farmed deer, sheep, and goats), particularly in New Zealand, as well as wildlife, pets, and humans. Farmers should monitor their livestock for the presence of this tick and decreased growth rates or signs of anemia in the animals. With respect to livestock, the tick is known to transmit a disease called Theileriosis to cattle, which results in severe anemia and possibly death. There are no human health or food safety risks associated with Theileria. This tick also has the potential to spread other bacterial and viral diseases to humans and other animals.<br />The animals and the property where the tick was found have been treated to eliminate the tick. To determine if the tick has spread to nearby wildlife, ongoing surveillance is being conducted by the NJ Division of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in cooperation with Wildlife Services from the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia.<br />The potential impact of this tick on tickborne illness in New Jersey residents is not yet known. In other parts of the world, the bush tick has been associated with several tickborne diseases, some of which are found in New Jersey, such as spotted fever rickettsioses. The Department of Agriculture is investigating if the ticks found locally are carrying any potential pathogens that may impact human or animal health.<br />Some tick species may become less active in the winter; however, it is important to take steps to prevent tick bites whenever you are in areas where ticks may be found. Protect yourself, your family and your pets from tick bites by:<br />Knowing where ticks are: ticks can live in or near wooded or grassy areas or on animals directly.<br />Using repellent on skin: use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone. Always follow product instructions.<br />Treating clothing, boots and camping gear with permethrin.<br />Covering up by wearing long sleeves and pants when spending time outdoors and consider tucking pants into socks to prevent ticks from getting under clothes.<br />Showering as soon as possible after coming indoors to remove unattached ticks.<br />Inspecting your body for ticks and removing ticks immediately.<br />Treating your pets with veterinarian-approved products to kill or repel ticks. Products are available for domestic animals like dogs and cats, as well as for animals like sheep, goats and cattle.<br />State and federal animal health and wildlife officials are working to address these findings. Response efforts will include surveillance of the property and wildlife within the region. If necessary, tick treatments will be conducted to reduce the risks of spread. The primary goal is to eradicate the tick before it spreads to new areas.<br />Questions about livestock can be directed to your local veterinarian or the State Veterinarian at 609-671-6400[2] during regular business hours.<br />This tick is a known pest in deer and has a wide host range, thus can infect a range of wildlife species. If the tick is detected in wildlife, then it should be immediately reported to the NJ Division of Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Wildlife Management at 609-984-6295[3] or the Office of Fish and Wildlife Health and Forensics at 908-637-4173 ext. 120[4].<br />For questions about tickborne illness in humans, contact your local health department (http://localhealth.nj.gov) or the New Jersey Department of Health during normal business hours at 609-826-5964[5][6]<br /> <br />Find us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/TAPintoHorses/[7]<br /> <br />References^ Sign Up for E-News (news.google.com)^ 609-671-6400 (news.google.com)^ 609-984-6295 (news.google.com)^ 908-637-4173 ext. 120 (news.google.com)^ http://localhealth.nj.gov (localhealth.nj.gov)^ 609-826-5964 (news.google.com)^ https://www.facebook.com/TAPintoHorses/ (www.facebook.com)",https://www.tapinto.net/towns/holmdel-and-colts-neck/sections/health-and-wellness/articles/health-alert-monmouth-county-tick-borne-diseases,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,,403,Restricted,"Location(s):['Monmouth County', 'Hunterdon County - TAPinto.net', 'Monmouth County', 'Hunterdon County - Holmdel & Colts Neck NJ', 'COUNTY', 'N.J.', 'Hunterdon County', 'New Jersey', 'Ames', 'Iowa', 'Monmouth County', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'New Zealand', 'Theileria', 'New Jersey', 'New Jersey', '/>For'],Host(s):['cattle', 'goats', 'humans', 'human'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Nov. 21, New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H.

D2CKQKKFWF,USDA taking precautions against African swine fever,"African swine fever (ASF) has been on the mind of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue every day of every week since the resurgence of the disease swept China, he shared at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s annual Agricultural Outlook Forum. With recent news that ASF has spread to Vietnam, Perdue continues to regularly ask his team about the techniques and protocols in place to guard U.S. borders.
As undersecretary of agriculture for marketing and regulatory affairs overseeing the efforts, Greg Ibach said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is busy on many fronts to protect the nation’s livestock industry not only from ASF but also classical swine fever and other similar diseases occurring around the world.
Related: China, U.S. swine industries gather to address African swine feverIbach said USDA continues to work closely with the pork industry. “They have fears and concerns. We want to be aware of what those fears and concerns are, and we want to have a good science-based discussion on whether these are things we should be worried about,” he said, adding that it’s also important to see if additional protocols should be put in place to safeguard against disease entry.
Ibach said the agency is reaching out to the U.S. Customs & Border Protection to inform those on the front lines which countries pose concerns. The epidemiology for ASF and classical swine fever is much the same as foot and mouth disease, which offers a blueprint for how to protect against disease entry domestically since it has been kept out of the U.S. successfully for more than 100 years.
Related: Vietnam confirms first ASF cases on three farms“If you have confidence in what we’ve done in the past in border protection, we’re upping the ante and asking for more surveillance from Customs & Border Protection. We’re using more dogs at the ports of entry for people who are moving, and we’re also talking to producers about biosecurity on the farms,” Ibach said.
Jack Shere, deputy administrator of veterinary services and chief veterinarian at USDA’s Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service, told attendees at the outlook forum on Feb. 22 that ASF is a difficult virus to get rid of and moves in uncured and uncooked meat. “Most of the movement we’ve seen historically has been done by people,” Shere noted. It has an incubation period of 5-21 days, and sometimes, there are no clinical signs of the virus.
Shere added that economists estimate that if ASF was to hit the U.S., it would cost the domestic pork industry $4 billion a year, as pork exports -- which currently comprise nearly one-fourth of total domestic pork production -- would come to a screeching halt. When you account for the additional impact on other commodities that serve the pork industry, you can see how the economic costs multiply.
Perdue, while speaking with Canada's Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay, said the North American nations, including Mexico, are working together in their efforts to prevent the entry of ASF to North America. Perdue likened it to a “neighborhood watch” that's designing a program to watch out for each other and establish protocols and standards of protection that all can agree upon.
“By defining protocols, our customers would know that they would be safe from us spreading those kinds of things,” Perdue said, explaining that the tremendous economic issues of sharing the long borders on the north and south make it important to “function together as one.”
MacAulay said he fully understands the devastation if hog exports are shut off. “I would like to sit down and put something together to deal with this issue not after it comes but before it comes,” he said. He related it to how nations deal with bovine tuberculosis whereby, if it is isolated and properly contained, exports can continue.
Perdue said the ongoing mobile nature of the world only increases the likelihood of things transferring from one nation to another. “We are committing even further to up our game in the neighborhood watch,” he said.",https://www.feedstuffs.com/news/usda-taking-precautions-against-african-swine-fever,NA,USDA taking precautions against African swine fever,Measures in places to protect U.S. producers from the spread of ASF according to top agricultural leaders.,https://www.feedstuffs.com/swine/usda-taking-precautions-against-african-swine-fever,article,en,NA,NA,"Swine, Livestock & Poultry Market news",13,,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['China', 'Vietnam', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Vietnam', 'U.S.', 'Canada', 'Mexico', 'North America'],Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[

Of the six samples sent by the Department of Animal Health in Hai Duong province, five were positive for virus ASF. The Department of Animal Health of the second section reported ASF in Hai Duong to the Government on the day. 
The ASF outbreak was reported in breeder Hoang Van Chinh's farm in Trai Moi village in Kim Mon district. 
The Department of Animal Health under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said it isolated outbreaks in farms in affected provinces, vets had to cull all dead and diseased hog herds in the neighborhood. 
So far, more than 2,300 pigs weighing 170,000 kilogram were culled. Consequently, breeders lost tens of billions of VND within two months. 
Worse, Head of the Department Pham Van Dong said that losing breeders have received a subsidy of VND38 ,000 ( $ 1.63 ) per kilogram of pig from the Government, breeders have received just VND27, 0000 per kilogram in some localities, much lower than the actual price. 
Moreover, breeders have to spend lots of time for finishing complicated paper work to receive the subsidy. Therefore, they have resorted to selling off their animals. 
Since the end of 2018 till now, many localities have merged animal health agencies into agricultural technique centers; hence, implementation of disease prevention task is stagnant. Violators of epidemiological hygiene have not been found and fined. 
Vets have not given bonus or quite low bonus for the special task in some localities; accordingly staffs of animal health departments were reluctant in taking part in prevention measures. 
Because of the high risk of ASF epidemic, the Government will convene an online tomorrow meeting with 63 cities and provinces on measures against ASF.

7NPP4HGLKZ,Deaths of Bald Eagles in Maryland Blamed on Poison,"At least seven eagles have died in areas along Maryland's Eastern Shore since March 1.Authorities believe they are being poisoned by a pesticide banned since 2009.The poison is passed through the food chain to the birds when they scavenge dead animals. Wildlife police say bald eagles are dying at an alarming rate along Maryland's Eastern Shore - likely thanks to reckless landowners who set out poison to kill foxes, raccoons and other ""nuisance"" animals.Six eagles were found dead March 1 in Kent County, near the Chesapeake Bay on the northern end of the Delmarva Peninsula, according to the Maryland Natural Resources Police. A great horned owl was also dead, and several other eagles were significantly sickened. Maryland officers as well as agents from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have since found several other dead eagles in the same area, and three seriously ill eagles were found about 45 miles south in Talbot County on April 3. Two of those were treated and are in stable condition, but one died at the scene. The eagles were scavenging on the carcass of a red fox. (MORE: New Wave of Satellites Could End Up as New Piles of Space Junk)All the dead and sickened eagles showed signs of ingesting poison. The illegal chemical carbofuran, a pesticide that killed millions of birds before it was banned in the U.S. in 2009, has been confirmed to have poisoned at least some of the bald eagles, Natural Resources Police Lt. Roy Rafter told the Associated Press. Police think old stocks of the pesticide are being used to kill foxes and other farm pests. The eagles, in turn, are poisoned when they feast on the dead animal's remains. Thirteen eagles were found sickened under similar circumstances in the same region of Maryland in 2016. “At best, it’s reckless, and, at worst, it could be a deliberate crime,” American Bird Conservancy President Mike Parr told the AP. Parr added: “It’s tragic. It seems deliberate from our point of view.”Maryland Natural Resources Police are offering a $10,000 reward for information that helps solve the case. “It is hard to believe that not one person has information of persons placing a toxic poison that has killed no fewer than twenty eagles in these areas,"" Fish and Wildlife Services Agent Jay Pilgrim said in a press release. ""The only way this stops is if the local communities come forward with information.” Bald eagles are no longer listed under the Endangered Species Act, but they are still federally protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.

92JDTJNPXZ,Wigan pet owners warned about deadly dog parasite,"Wigan pet owners are being urged to recognise the symptoms of a potentially fatal dog disease which has spread to the North of England.

Lungworm was originally believed to be limited to southern regions but research has revealed that the parasite has now reached as far as Scotland. To date there have been three recorded cases of lungworm in Wigan and 13 just over the border in St Helens and Warrington. Dr Huw Stacey, director of clinical services at Vets4Pets, said: “The continued spread of the lungworm parasite throughout the UK over the past ten years or so means the dog population is increasingly at risk.”Lungworm uses multiple species to help complete its life cycle. Dogs and foxes are the primary host, while slugs, snails and even frogs are the intermediate hosts.Larvae are produced inside the dog or fox and pass through their faeces, which are eaten by slugs and snails, where the parasite can then develop inside these hosts.If a dog accidentally eats an infected slug or snail, or comes into contact with their slime, they can become infected too. “Chewing grass, drinking from water bowls outside and playing with toys and sticks that have been in the garden overnight can all increase the risk of dogs contracting lungworm,” said Dr Stacey.The parasite can often be difficult to diagnose, with some dogs not showing signs of infection for months, meaning sudden death can occur, particularly in younger dogs. The signs can also be very variable, and the coughing and breathing difficulties can often be confused with conditions like kennel cough.Dr Stacey added: “Common signs of the disease include coughing and breathing problems, but also weight loss, vomiting, diarrhoea, tiredness, blood clotting or excessive bleeding from small wounds and changes in behaviour. However, in many cases of lungworm, a dog doesn’t display any clear signs of the disease for quite some time, or if they do, the signs can present very differently in each dog.”Although it can be fatal, lungworm is preventable. “It’s important that dog owners remember to keep up with their dog’s treatment every month,” said Dr Stacey. “Worming every three months, which is advised for other parasites, such as roundworm and tapeworm, will not be effective at preventing this parasite.""The outcome for an affected dog in most cases is very good if it is diagnosed quickly and the dog receives prompt treatment.”",https://www.wigantoday.net/news/wigan-pet-owners-warned-about-deadly-dog-parasite-1-9767523,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en-US,NA,NA,NA,9,,403,Restricted,"Location(s):['Scotland', 'St Helens', 'UK'],Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[To date there have been three recorded cases of lungworm in Wigan and 13 just over the border in St Helens and Warrington., If a dog accidentally eats an infected slug or snail, or comes into contact with their slime, they can become infected too., The parasite can often be difficult to diagnose, with some dogs not showing signs of infection for months, meaning sudden death can occur, particularly in younger dogs., However, in many cases of lungworm, a dog doesn’t display any clear signs of the disease for quite some time, or if they do, the signs can present very differently in each dog.”Although, ""The outcome for an affected dog in most cases is very good if it is diagnosed quickly and the dog receives prompt treatment.”],No. of outbreak Sentences:5",Insufficient Metadata,NA,7,,"Spatial Entities---['Scotland', 'St Helens', 'UK']","Temporal Entities---['the past ten years', 'months', 'every month', 'every three months']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]",,0.52
04LR8VRXRN,Why are so many gray whales dying in WA?,"While the necropsied animals so far are of both genders and all ages, “the one common thread seems to be that many of these whales are skinny and undernourished,” Milstein says. If more whales are competing for food, some of them might not be getting enough.
Scientists have observed some of the whales were emaciated enough for ribs to show. “They basically don’t have the body size and capacity that they typically would at this time of year [to get back to the Arctic for summer feedings] ... which mostly lasts them through the rest of the year,” Milstein says, “so for some reason some of these whales didn’t put on as much weight last summer, and have not had enough energy to make it all the way back there for the next feeding seasons.”
But scientists can’t rule out starving whales as a sign that something is amiss in their ecosystem. “[Strandings] could be exacerbated by changes in the environment — [gray whales] are a good reflection of what’s going on in the ocean,” Milstein says. “The bigger the population, the more sensitive it’s going to be to environmental changes.”
Millstein says this could be a sign of a decline in quantity, quality and availability of food. Because gray whales eat arthropods — insectlike creatures at the very bottom of the food chain — arthropod health impacts animal health all the way up the chain.
“The same thing that’s affecting [gray whales] may affect other species in different ways, if they either depend on the same food sources, or depend on food sources higher in the food web,” Milstein says.
NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center is investigating arthropod health in whale feeding areas, he says.
For whatever reason, the whales have also been exhibiting strange behavior this year, Milstein says. Whales don’t often come into Puget Sound, but more of them have been venturing into bays and sounds than usual.
“It's not uncommon for whales to duck into the bays on their way north from time to time, but then typically they’ll head back out and continue their migration to the Arctic,” he says. “ It’s not the main migration route by any means. So why these whales are stopping off in the bays and sounds is an open question. Given the increase of population, they may be looking for more habitat that hasn’t been occupied. They may be resting on their migration north or they may be running out of energy, like some of them seem to be.”
“We’re very interested in watching the [whale strandings] from that standpoint that they can be a reflection of the overall condition of the ocean,” Milstein says, “But we don’t see this as a threat to the population as a whole.”
Between the mortalities and strange behavior, though, Cascadia is conducting a survey for live whales.
“Along with these elevated mortalities, we often get gray whales in unusual areas or in poor body conditions that are sighted alive,” Calambokidis says. “Right now we’re surveying [Whidbey], an area where we often get almost every year the same dozen or so returning gray whales that feed here normally, and are part of a healthy dynamic, but we're surveying this area to look at which whales are here, are they the same whales we've seen in past years, and do they appear to be in good health or not.” 
Looking to history
This isn’t the first strange uptick in gray whale deaths in recent history. A similar spike took place over two years in 1999 and 2000, when 651 whales beached across the West Coast and the total population fell to 16,000. Almost 50 whales stranded themselves in Washington state.
Scientists still aren’t sure why that spike happened: Only three of those animals were necropsied, and all three were emaciated. Scientists observed that many other dead and living whales were also visibly underweight.
“That was part of a major mortality event, throughout the range of the eastern north Pacific grey whale, and that seems to be what’s developing here,” Calambokidis says. “But we're still early in the season. Peak mortality is April, May and June, so we're not even through our peak period.”
Depending on how this season pans out, scientists may be able to establish patterns between the two stranding crises. Scientists in California are already noting that there are fewer calves than normal making their way north, which can occur when mothers are too thin to carry babies to term.
Nevertheless, the population rebounded after the millennial stranding crisis. “The whale population as a whole is very resilient and healthy and has demonstrated that with the right protections and conservation measures, the population can do very well and flourish,” Milstein says.
Stressed-out responders
Whether whale deaths are indicative of something ominous or not, sources say there is concern for our ability to manage increased deaths. In a stranding response, volunteers work with NOAA, the Fish and Wildlife Department and local officials to remove whales from highly public areas to undisclosed shores suited to natural decomposition. Of the five stranded whales this month, all but the Harborview whale washed up on an outer coastal beach and was allowed to decompose where they landed. The Fish and Wildlife Department towed the Harborview animal by service boat.
The decomposition process typically takes up to two months, Wilkinson says; necropsied animals take about a month.
“[NOAA is] congressionally mandated to collect Level A data, which is very basic data on marine mammal strandings,” Wilkinson says. That data includes genus, species, initial observation, day of response, the condition of the carcass, whether the animal is alive, and more.
If the body is in good enough condition and accessible, NOAA performs necropsies to determine cause of death. Occasionally, samples are sent to a pathologist in Seattle.
In rare occasions, organizations with authorization letters can claim cleaned whale skeletons for educational purposes, Wilkinson says. Seattle Pacific University is currently going through the process of claiming a whale that stranded in February.
This takes lots of human effort and funding. Wilkinson says that removal and relocation of a single whale on average costs  $10,000 to $14,000; six scientists were needed to perform the Harborview necropsy. Sinking a whale carcass requires expensive ocean dumping permits through the Environmental Protection Agency. Field responders in the stranding network rely significantly on grants to supplement NOAA funding.
“It’s costly and complicated” to move a whale, Wilkinson says, especially in Puget Sound “due to the high human population and limited beach availability.”
“To do a necropsy you need at least a few people, and they need to be experienced, and there's a limit to that expertise that we have, so we really rely on our stranding network,” Milstein says. “All these groups are responding to more whales than we’ve seen in many years and that takes time and effort, and we couldn’t do it without them.”
Despite the stress, there are reasons to be hopeful, Calambokidis adds.
“We did today see at least seven healthy gray whales feeding in northern Puget Sound, so it’s not all doom and gloom,” he says. “Some of the animals up here in North Puget Sound that we saw today are animals we first identified in 1990, so we’ve seen them now for almost 30 years. And that was just in our survey today, so we’re kind of encouraged.""",https://crosscut.com/2019/05/why-are-so-many-gray-whales-dying-wa,Crosscut,Why are so many gray whales dying in WA?,"Eighteen gray whales have stranded themselves along Washington's shorelines in 2019, and experts are looking for answers.  ",https://crosscut.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_2000x2000/public/images/articles/whale_stranded.jpeg?itok=AsEceSnZ,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,13,0.8125,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Arctic', 'Cascadia', 'the West Coast', 'Washington', 'Pacific', 'California', 'Seattle', 'North Puget Sound'],Host(s):['duck', 'human'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Why are so many gray whales dying in WA?.While the necropsied animals so far are of both genders and all ages, “the one common thread seems to be that many of these whales are skinny and undernourished,” Milstein says.,

VYNNF8GLUT,GLDA hatchery closed after increased mortality seen among Muscovy ducklings,"The Guyana Livestock and Development Authority’s (GLDA) hatchery has been closed until further notice because of the increased mortality rate observed among the Muscovy breed of ducklings.
According to a GLDA notice appearing in today’s Guyana Chronicle, its surveillance team has seen an increased mortality rate of the ducklings being hatched at the facility and the GLDA says it has also been told by some farmers that a “similar occurrence was taking place on a number of farms throughout the various regions”.
The GLDA said that the high mortality rates were recorded primarily in the Muscovy breed of ducklings generally between the ages of two to three weeks. To date, it said that it has not received reports of high mortality in adult Muscovy ducks and other breeds such as Pekin and the Kunshan.
“The ducklings most affected are from the farms that toll hatch at the GLDA hatchery, therefore, as a result of this unusual occurrence, the GLDA is currently conducting an active surveillance exercise throughout all 5 coastal regions and (is) monitoring the breeding flocks of the affected farmers. We are hereby seeking the cooperation of the duck farmers to conduct the surveillance exercise”, the GLDA notice said.
The GLDA said that it was also working with an overseas reference laboratory to have this “unusual event” addressed as quickly as possible.
“We at the GLDA are aware that the economic impact on the duck farming community is going to be huge and we are working assiduously to have this situation rectified at the earliest opportune time”, the GLDA said.
The notice said that the duck farming community can rest assure that the GLDA has the full support of the Board of Directors and the Ministry of Agriculture and it is doing everything possible to have this matter resolved.
It said that it would welcome any information from the farming community in this regard and can be contacted on 220-6556 or 220-6557 or by email at glda1910@gmail.com",https://www.stabroeknews.com/2019/news/guyana/05/18/glda-hatchery-closed-after-increased-mortality-seen-among-muscovy-ducklings/,Stabroek News,GLDA hatchery closed after increased mortality seen among Muscovy ducklings - Stabroek News,The Guyana Livestock and Development Authority’s (GLDA) hatchery has been closed until further notice because of the increased mortality rate observed,https://www.stabroeknews.com/2019/05/18/news/guyana/glda-hatchery-closed-after-increased-mortality-seen-among-muscovy-ducklings/?ia_markup=1,article,en_US,NA,2019-05-18T14:21:32+00:00,NA,15,0.9375,200,Accessible,"Location(s):[],Host(s):['ducks', 'duck'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[To date, it said that it has not received reports of high mortality in adult Muscovy ducks and other breeds such as Pekin and the Kunshan.],No. of outbreak Sentences:1",Sufficient Metadata,Stabroek News,10,0.555555556,Spatial Entities---[],"Temporal Entities---['today', 'between the ages of two to three weeks']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['ducks', 'duck'],Agent(s):[]",0.84,0.83
S5IMWV3AA9,Chinese farm says it dumped dead pigs in river,"Story highlights Chinese media say a pig farm admits to dumping pigs into Huangpu RiverA porcine circovirus is found in a water sampleWeibo users voice skepticism over assurances of water safetyA Chinese farm admitted to dumping dead pigs into Huangpu River, which had about 6,000 bloated carcasses pulled from its water this week, state media reported. The labels in the ears of the pigs indicated Jiaxing City as their birthplace, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency. The city is south of Shanghai, in the Zhejiang Province. Earlier, local Chinese media had suggested the dead pigs had come from the area with local officials blaming dumping on ""local pig farmers who lack awareness of laws and regulations."" The city's government said a total of 70,000 pigs died from ""crude raising techniques and extreme weather"" at the beginning of the year, according to Xinhua. But it also insisted that the collected corpses were disposed safely. The selling of diseased pigs appears to be a bigger problem in the area as on Wednesday, a court in Zhejiang Province, issued prison sentences for 46 people convicted of selling meat from diseased pigs, Xinhua said.The sentences ranged from six months to 6 and a half years in prison, the report said.Shanghai water concernsThe ""dead pig dumping scandal"" in Shanghai has been growing since Friday, Xinhua reported. Chinese officials have said they expect to find more carcasses in the river -- but they insist the Shanghai water is fine. The scandal has incredulous residents one-upping each other on the country's popular microblog service, Sina Weibo. ""Since when is finding dead rotting pigs in a major river not a public health problem?"" Weibo user, @Muyunsanjun2011, asked. ""Answer: When this happens in China.""A report in the Shanghai Daily newspaper earlier Wednesday said that no pollution had been found in the river.""Since apparently, the water has not been contaminated, big leaders, please go ahead and have the first drink,"" Weibo user,@_Nina_Burbage quipped.However, a later water sample was found to contain a porcine circovirus, Xinhua said.The World Health Organization says there are two types of porcine circoviruses, but neither is known to cause disease in humans. An official from a Shanghai water plant was quoted in Xinhua saying, ""If the water is contaminated, we will put more the disinfectants and activated carbon to purify the water.""'Dead pigs all around'Sanitation workers, clad in masks and plastic suits, have been fishing the bruised pig bodies surfacing in the Huangpu River. The pink, decomposing blobs have wreaked foul odors and alarmed residents. ""There were dead pigs all around and they really stunk,"" one local resident told CNN. ""Of course, we're worried, but what can you do about it? It's water that we have to drink and use.""If the water treatment process is very effective and can handle the sudden glut of contaminants, it's possible to minimize the impact, said Julian Fyfe, a senior research consultant specializing in water quality at the University of Technology Sydney.However, ""most treatment plants would not be designed to accommodate that level of shock loading. It's such an unusual event,"" he added.Fyfe spoke in general terms about water quality issues, as he is not involved with Shanghai's water treatment.""If they are chlorinating heavily, which a lot of places may do, especially if they've got a very polluted water body to start with, then the effects could potentially be small,"" Fyfe said. Pig corpses that have been in the water for days would leak blood, intestinal fluids and other pollutants, which could alter the taste and color of tap water. Many residents have begun drinking bottled water due to fears of contamination, according to the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper.Ripe for satireThe agricultural commission in China said it had tested organ samples from the pigs and the results suggested the animals had contracted a porcine circovirus.On Tuesday, national officials acknowledged the pig incident in a press conference Tuesday.

TTKX075BPP,6 Nara deer deaths attributed to plastic in stomachs; tourists cautioned to feed animals properly,"One of the highlights of a visit to Nara is the chance to walk amongst the city’s free-roaming deer. And with more than two million foreign visitors last year alone, some of the deer in the area have been so well-fed by day trippers that they find it hard to stand on their feet during holiday periods.
However, it appears that some tourists have been feeding these nationally protected animals something other than the deer-friendly senbei crackers sold by vendors in the area. According to a recent report from the Nara Deer Welfare Association, the animals have been eating plastic, which has led to the deaths of a number of deer in recent months.
▼ A senbei vendor in Nara

A veterinarian from the association said a sickly looking deer was found near Todaiji temple in Nara Park on March 23, and although they attempted to feed it, it refused to eat. The severely weak 17-year-old female deer–which weighed 30 kilograms, 10 kilograms below the healthy weight range–died the next day.
An autopsy revealed that the stomach of the animal was almost entirely filled with hardened material that looked like a clump of polyethylene bags. The mass weighed 3.2 kilograms.
Like cows and sheep, deer chew their cud as part of a process called rumination in order to digest nutrients in plant-based foods. The food first enters the rumen, one of their four-chambered stomachs, where it’s broken down by bacteria before being regurgitated for the animal to chew in order to be fully digested. However, the accumulation of so many bags inside the deer’s stomach made it unable to regurgitate, digest, and ingest new food, resulting in its death.
A similar case was recorded last year, when a deer that still had its summer coat in November lost weight and died. An autopsy revealed a clump of bags in its stomach as well.
Since March this year, a total of eight deer with deaths from unknown causes have been autopsied. Six were found to have plastic bags in their stomachs, with the largest clump weighing 4.3 kilograms.
The association is now appealing to the public to help save the deer from themselves by being more careful with what they allow the deer to eat. Signs around Nara clearly state that deer should not be fed anything other than deer senbei, but there have been sightings of tourists holding out plastic bags with food for the deer to eat, and cases where deer bite into plastic bags carried by tourists. Deer are unable to tell the difference between food and plastic, and if tourists are carrying food or sweets inside plastic bags, which are at nose-height for the animals, the deer’s keen sense of smell will lead them to believe the bag and its contents are both edible food.
Littering around Nara Park is also a problem for the local deer population, so visitors are being reminded to take their litter with them. And in an effort to help tackle the problem, the Nara Deer Welfare Association has now developed a special environmentally friendly bag made from natural materials, to stop any possibility of plastic being consumed inadvertently.
So next time you’re traveling to Nara to meet the deer, you might want to ditch the plastic bags and keep an eye out for any plastic litter lying about. And don’t let the animals bully you into giving them everything they want, no matter how persistent they may be.

SKPOFGHPLN,Department declares end of foot and mouth outbreak in Limpopo,"Department declares end of foot and mouth outbreak in Limpopo 
A health officer checks cattle at a farm as a preventive measure against foot-and-mouth disease. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on Tuesday declared the end of a Foot-and-mouth disease ( FMD ) outbreak in Limpopo. File photo: Reuters.JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries ( DAFF ) on Tuesday declared the end of a Foot-and-mouth disease ( FMD ) outbreak, and said that there had not been any new cases of FMD in the declared disease management area since February. 
DAFF said that more than three incubation periods had lapsed. 

South Africa experienced an FMD outbreak in Limpopo and, as a result, lost its World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) recognised FMD-free zone without vaccination status. 
`` We should not rest but remain vigilant and continuously seek to improve biosecurity procedures and measures to protect our animals and our people against the spreading of disease, '' DAFF said. 
It said the intensive surveillance has demonstrated that the virus was no longer circulating. However, control measures remained in place in the area. 

The farming community and public were urged to remain vigilant. 
In April, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister, Senzeni Zokwana lead a high-profile delegation to the affected communities in Limpopo to express their heartfelt appreciation to the farmers and all other parties that worked with the DAFF to contain the outbreak and resolve the situation. 
The DAFF said it prepared and submitted a dossier to the OIE applying for a Containment Zone. This application does not form part of the normal OIE processes for zoning and thus will not be considered by a formal sitting of the OIE Scientific Commission but will rather be considered through an electronic round robin process. 

`` The DAFF is hopeful for a positive outcome of its application in the near future, '' the department said. 
The department said it has negotiated market access for safe commodities to most of the trading countries. 
The most recent success was China lifting its ban on wool imports from South Africa. Negotiations were still underway for beef exports to China, and the DAFF said it was in the process of confirming dates for the next inspection visit by the Chinese veterinary authority.

Q7ELTQFKFW,African swine fever continues to spread,"African swine fever continues to spread 
By Jonathan Martin. 
Staff Writer. 
Farms.com African swine fever ( ASF ) is still burning its way through China's swine herds. Over the past week, ASF has killed 87 pigs in three locations. The Chinese government is executing its ASF Epidemic Emergency Implementation Plan in a continued effort to contain the outbreaks, a May 21 Chinese state release says. Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs confirmed its first ASF outbreak in Liaoning Province on Aug. 3, 2018, officials have detected 133 ASF outbreaks in 32 regions. In total, officials and farmers have culled 1,129,000 pigs to try to prevent further spread of the disease, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reports.ASF has n't made its way into North America, but the U.S. and Canada have developed collaborative strategies to handle a potential outbreak. On May 24, the U.S. and Canada's chief veterinary officers announced that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the United States Department of Agriculture agreed to allow `` safe trade '' to continue in the event ASF is reported in either country. The two nations modified their export certificates to allow trade of live swine, swine semen, pet food, animal by-products and meat to continue in approved disease-free zones in the event of an ASF outbreak. In the U.S., pork producers marketed over 120 million hogs in 2017, which provided total cash receipts of more than US$ 20 billion. Canadian pork producers saw almost C$ 4.5 billion in cash receipts that same year. At a Feb. 21 meeting, the U.S., Canada and Mexico agreed to work together to prevent infected pork from crossing their respective borders. So far, the partnership has proved successful.

BISMARCK, N.D. ( News. 
Dakota.com ) -- North Dakota's state veterinarian is reminding livestock producers to vaccinate their animals against anthrax. Dr. Susan Keller says that with the precipitation which has fallen in much of the state, conditions are right for the disease to occur. 
An effective anthrax vaccine is readily available, but it takes about a week for immunity to be established, and it must be administered annually to maintain protection. 
`` Producers should consult with their veterinarians to make sure their animals are current on their anthrax vaccination schedule, '' Keller said. 
`` Producers should monitor their herds and report unexplained deaths to their veterinarian early to seek a diagnosis, '' Keller said. `` Even if not anthrax, it's important to attempt to determine the cause of death to prevent other potential losses. '' 
Anthrax has been more frequently reported in northeast, southeast and south central North Dakota, but historically, it has been found in almost every part of the state. 
It is not uncommon to have a few anthrax cases reported in North Dakota almost every year. In 2005, however, more than 500 confirmed deaths from anthrax were reported with total losses estimated at more than 1,000 head. Affected animals included cattle, bison, horses, sheep, llamas and farmed deer and elk. 
An anthrax factsheet is available on the North Dakota Department of Agriculture website at www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/anthrax. 
Anthrax is caused by the bacteria Bacillus anthracis. The bacterial spores can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions. The disease occurs most commonly following heavy rainfall, but may also occur during extremely dry conditions. Animals are exposed when they graze or consume forage or water contaminated with the spores.",https://www.newsdakota.com/2019/05/28/conditions-right-for-anthrax-in-livestock/,News Dakota,Conditions Right for Anthrax in Livestock,"BISMARCK, N.D.

9YLQP1HQ9R,Strangles in Horses: Interpreting Gold-Standard Test Results,"Strangles in Horses: Interpreting Gold-Standard Test Results 
An infectious respiratory disease caused by Streptococcus equi subspecies equi bacteria, strangles in horses spreads with ease. Thus, it's important that veterinarians diagnose it quickly and accurately to prevent outbreaks. They have two methods of doing so: culture and the more reliable qPCR test, which detects bacterial and viral DNA. Nicola Pusterla, DVM, PhD, Dipl. ACVIM, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, reviewed these methods and their efficacy at the 2018 American Association of Equine Practitioners Convention, held Dec. 1 - 5 in San Francisco, California. In recent years, he said, qPCR has supplanted traditional S. equi culture as the gold-standard diagnostic test for strangles in horses. While culture is convenient and cost-effective, it's time-consuming and can produce false negatives. The qPCR test is much faster, with better sensitivity and specificity ( ability to accurately identify results ). The results, however, can be difficult to interpret, said Pusterla, as veterinarians often ca n't determine whether it has detected a dead -- indicating past exposure or infection -- or live organism. `` This is important because we need to engage in appropriate biosecurity, as well as know when we can take ( an affected ) horse out of isolation, '' said Pusterla. So he conducted a study of 30 horses with suspected S. equi infection to determine how to best interpret qPCR results. Pusterla collected 85 biological samples via nasopharyngeal swabs and guttural pouch ( an internal sac that represents an outgrowth of the eustachian tube and acts to equalize pressure within the ear ) lavage. He used three molecular methods to determine organism viability: absolute quantitation of the target gene ( basically, determining its numbers ), detection of messenger RNA, and absolute quantitation after enrichment ( incubation in a culture broth to grow bacteria ). Based on his results, Pusterla said any of these qPCR approaches could be effective in diagnosing true cases of strangles in horses, but if absolute quantitation produces positives, consider those S. equi organisms to be viable. This can help the veterinarian determine whether a horse has an active infection and take the appropriate biosecurity steps to prevent disease spread, he said. It can also confirm whether it's safe to remove a horse from quarantine.",https://thehorse.com/173193/strangles-in-horses-interpreting-gold-standard-test-results/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,,403,Restricted,"Location(s):['San Francisco', 'California'],Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[The results, however, can be difficult to interpret, said Pusterla, as veterinarians often ca n't determine whether it has detected a dead -- indicating past exposure or infection -- or live organism., So he conducted a study of 30 horses with suspected S. equi infection to determine how to best interpret qPCR results., Based on his results, Pusterla said any of these qPCR approaches could be effective in diagnosing true cases of strangles in horses, but if absolute quantitation produces positives, consider those S. equi organisms to be viable., This can help the veterinarian determine whether a horse has an active infection and take the appropriate biosecurity steps to prevent disease spread, he said., It can also confirm whether it's safe to remove a horse from quarantine.],No. of outbreak Sentences:5",Insufficient Metadata,NA,7,,"Spatial Entities---['San Francisco', 'California']","Temporal Entities---['2018', 'Dec. 1 - 5', 'recent years']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]",,0.48

9S2DUXFSY9,Mosquitoes with West Nile virus identified in southern Israel,"Mosquitoes with West Nile virus identified in southern Israel 
Following routine tests carried out by the Ministry of Environmental Protection in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, for the first time this year, mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus were identified in Israel, in Moshav Idan in the Central Arava Regional Council. 
As soon as laboratory results were received from the Ministry of Health, the Southern District of the Ministry of Environmental Protection updated the Central Arava Regional Council with the results, and demanded that the local authority expand the scope of supervision and control, if necessary, of the mosquitoes in its area. 
In the wake of the rainy winter, stagnant water is present throughout the country, and there is concern over possible potential widespread growth in mosquito populations. In order to prevent high rates of sickness with West Nile virus and mosquito nuisances this year, all local authorities throughout the country are being called on to step up their actions to reduce mosquito hazards by expanding monitoring and control of mosquitoes in their territory. 
Alon Zasak, Senior Deputy Director General for Natural Resources at the Ministry of Environmental Protection, called on the local authorities to increase efforts to eliminate the hazards, while noting that the public can also act to reduce the number of mosquitoes through simple means, including drying water sources in courtyards, roofs and shelters, alongside notification of the local authority for every mosquito nuisance in the public domain. In addition, it is recommended to protect against mosquito bites by placing nets over the windows of one's house and applying mosquito repellants whenever one is in a mosquito-infested area. 
Infection with West Nile Virus is caused by a virus found mainly in birds, and transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. 
According to the Mayo Clinic, `` Most people infected with West Nile virus either do n't develop signs or symptoms or have only minor ones, such as fever and mild headache. However, some people develop a life-threatening illness that includes inflammation of the spinal cord or brain. ''

HP6MY4OVYP,Virulent ND in California sending wake-up call to US poultry industry,"Virulent ND in California sending wake-up call to US poultry industry 
Outbreaks of virulent Newcastle disease ( vND ) that have spread from backyard to commercial flocks in California are providing a wake-up call to the entire US poultry industry about the need for ND monitoring and adherence to strict biosecurity, Joseph Giambrone, PhD, a professor at Auburn University, told Poultry Health Today. 
As of this writing, USDA has confirmed more than 400 cases of vND in California that include three commercial layer flocks. There has also been a case in Utah as well as one in Arizona; both involve small backyard flocks and are believed to be connected to the California outbreak. 
`` No question about it, '' Giambrone said when asked if the US poultry industry should be concerned about these regional outbreaks. 
Virulent ND is a highly contagious, deadly viral disease also called `` exotic ND '' or velogenic ND. The professor explained that it affects both the respiratory and enteric tracts. The source is virtually always backyard birds. It's a difficult situation because it's impossible to keep track of backyard birds and their numbers, he said, and noted that wild birds can also be a source of infection. 
On commercial farms, poultry houses become an incubator for vND due to their large size, and the problem is amplified, he said. 
Monitoring is essential 
Giambrone stressed the importance of monitoring. `` It's similar to avian influenza in that you have to continually, continually monitor. '' If anything out of the ordinary is found, such as increased mortality or a combination of respiratory and enteric disease, it needs to be reported to the state veterinarian. The farm may need to be quarantined. 
Commercial farms need to remain vigilant about biosecurity and make sure anyone who comes onto the farm has no contact with backyard birds. Care must be taken to avoid exposing flocks to vND due to sharing of contaminated equipment, which is one of the ways avian influenza is spread, he said. 
At least in the southeastern US, where most of the poultry industry is concentrated, live-bird markets are n't permitted as they are in California, Giambrone added, which helps reduce the spread of vND. 
The role of vaccination, he continued, takes on added importance in light of the California vND outbreaks, but it can be difficult, particularly for layer producers with birds in cages and automated water systems. It's hard to get all the birds to drink the water, and live ND vaccines can be reactive and affect egg production and shell quality. 
`` So, commercial producers are reluctant to continue to vaccinate, '' he explained. In addition, it costs money to vaccinate, and both live and killed ND vaccines are only effective for a certain amount of time, Giambrone said. 
Nevertheless, he thinks vaccination is good insurance. The question is how much protection each farm needs. `` How much insurance are you willing to pay for? '' Giambrone asked. 
`` With Newcastle, at least we have the vaccines to prevent the spread. '' For commercial layer farms anywhere near farms with an outbreak, `` it would be incumbent on you to do serological testing ... then re-vaccinate, even if it's going to cost you in production, '' Giambrone said.",https://thepoultrysite.com/news/2019/05/virulent-nd-in-california-sending-wake-up-call-to-us-poultry-industry,NA,"	Virulent ND in California sending wake-up call to US poultry industry","	Virulent Newcastle disease is spreading from backyard poultry farms to commercial flocks, producers are urged to adhere to strict biosecurity measures",https://www.thepoultrysite.com/news/2019/05/virulent-nd-in-california-sending-wake-up-call-to-us-poultry-industry,website,en,NA,NA,NA,13,0.8125,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['California', 'US', 'California', 'US', 'Newcastle', 'California', 'US', 'California', 'Utah', 'Arizona', 'California', 'US', 'US', 'California', 'California', 'Newcastle'],Host(s):['poultry', 'birds', 'bird'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[

NS72FORJ1Q,California duck breeder finds low-pathogenic avian flu,"California duck breeder finds low-pathogenic avian flu 
As part of routine surveillance for H5/H7 avian influenza, H5 low-pathogenic avian influenza ( LPAI ) was detected in a commercial duck breeder flock in Monterey County, Cal., exposing 9,746 birds, according to information the U.S. Department of Agriculture submitted to the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) on April 24. 
According to the OIE report, partial HA sequencing determined the H5 to be a LPAI virus of North American wild bird lineage, but further characterization is pending virus recovery. There have been no clinical signs of illness or increased mortality on the premises, the report said. 
USDA's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) and the California Department of Food & Agriculture are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this finding, the OIE report said. 
Two additional commercial poultry premises associated with the initial premises have been quarantined and sampled for avian influenza virus, and the results are pending. 
Control measures applied in the case include movement controls, surveillance and quarantine. 
LPAI viruses typically cause few or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds ' feces and respiratory secretions and spreads primarily through direct contact among healthy and infected birds, according to APHIS. LPAI can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials. 
To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm, APHIS said. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Avian influenza viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must first be cleaned from the environment. 
On the other hand, highly pathogenic avian influenza is a serious disease and requires rapid response because it is highly contagious and often fatal to chickens and turkeys, APHIS said.",https://www.feedstuffs.com/nutrition-health/california-duck-breeder-finds-low-pathogenic-avian-flu,NA,California duck breeder finds low-pathogenic avian flu,California duck breeder finds low-pathogenic avian flu,https://www.feedstuffs.com/nutrition-and-health/california-duck-breeder-finds-low-pathogenic-avian-flu,article,en,NA,NA,"Nutrition & Health, Market News, Poultry",13,0.8125,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['California', 'California', 'Monterey County', 'premises'],Host(s):['duck', 'birds', 'bird', 'poultry', 'chickens', 'turkeys'],Agent(s):['LPAI', 'highly pathogenic']","Outbreak:[

TMU20ZEHWH,Leptospirosis cases rise in Kerala,"Leptospirosis cases rise in Kerala 
It is a disease that is easily preventable and curable when detected and treated early. Sadly, poor compliance with health advisories issued by the Health Department has been leading to unnecessary loss of lives due to leptospirosis in the State. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease that is transmitted through contact of the skin and mucous membranes with water or mud contaminated with rodent urine. A leptospirosis outbreak in the aftermath of a disaster was an eventuality that the department was prepared to tackle and sufficient warnings had been issued to the public. However, the department's health advisories do not seem to have been taken seriously by the general public. Leptospirosis is transmitted through contact of the skin and mucous membranes with water or mud contaminated with rodent urine. During heavy flooding, the infectious organism is spread to larger and distant areas and hence everyone who comes into contact with flood waters are at risk of contracting the infection. Despite the availability of a drug with proven efficacy as a pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylactic against leptospirosis, the refusal of people to take the drug continues to baffle the department. 

Never too late for doxycycline `` Doxycycline has been found to be over 70 % efficient even when one has been exposed to the infectious agent. The majority of those who have taken the drug will not get the disease if consumed as per the guidelines. Even if one were to contract the infectious agent, it would be only anicteric leptospirosis ( a mild, self-limiting flu-like illness ), '' says R. Aravind, Head of Infectious Diseases, Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College. `` About 90 % of the cases occurring in the community will always be anicteric and may not even be captured by the heath system data. It is only in 5-10 % cases of icteric leptospirosis or Weil's syndrome, with multi-organ involvement, that we expect the mortality to go up to 15 %, '' he says. Pulmonary haemorrhage. 
Pulmonary involvement is usually a late complication of leptospirosis, which affects all major organs. In the leptospirosis outbreak in South Gujarat in 2006, in the aftermath of heavy flooding, nearly 57 % of the deaths had been due to pulmonary haemorrhage. A similar situation seems to be happening in Kerala too right now a Doctors report pulmonary haemorrhagic syndrome as the lethal complication that seems to be setting in by the third or fourth day of the illness, leading to increased mortality. 
The situation in private sector, as per reports, is not alarming and serious cases of lepto complications are still being dealt by the Government Medical Colleges. `` What we are seeing in our ICUs are late presentation of patients, with pulmonary involvement and multi-organ failure setting in on the third or fourth day itself. The patient then requires ventilation and dialysis. If leptospirosis complications present as pulmonary haemorrhage and/or myocarditis, then 50-70 % mortality should be expected in any clinical settings, '' says Dr. Aravind. While pulmonary haemorrhagic presentation is not new, the sudden spike in the number of cases with this complication is worrying. One of the problems in the clinical scenario is that leptospirosis has a wide spectrum of symptoms which may mimic the clinical symptoms of tropical diseases like dengue, H1N1 or Scrub typhus and hence the diagnosis of an acute undifferentiated febrile illness could be very difficult. Medical literature says that in up to 8 % of the cases, there could be co-infections. Laboratory diagnosis of leptospirosis continues to be a challenge, because current serological tests which tests for antibodies, like ELISA, do not give confirmatory results in the acute phase of the disease. In recent years, the Health Department has introduced RT PCR tests for leptospirosis screening at the State Public Health Laboratories, which can give confirmatory results within the first week itself, in the early phase of the disease. But these are not widely available. However, in public health settings, especially in a post-disaster scenario, there is no significance for laboratory confirmation of leptospirosis, senior health officials point out. `` If there is a history of exposure to floodwaters and clinical symptoms include myalgia ( muscle pain, localised to calf and lumbar region ) and fever ( might be very mild ), the presumptive diagnosis should be leptospirosis. We can not wait for lab tests, the patient should be started on Doxycycline or Crystalline Penicillin therapy immediately, depending on the symptoms, '' an official said. Treatment protocol. 
While the treatment guidelines have remained the same, but with the case numbers going up, the Health Department has optimised the protocol so that doctors in PHCs/CHCs can be more sure when to refer a patient to a higher centre. Accordingly, any person presenting with fever and myalgia and should be given presumptive treatment with doxycycline ,100 mg twice a day for seven days. He should be followed up daily and if at all there are any red flag signs -- breathing difficulty, hypotension, jaundice, reduced urine output, any bleeding manifestations, altered sensorium -- he should be referred to a tertiary care centre and administered Penicillin therapy or third generation alternatives like ceftriaxone immediately to prevent the patient progressing into further complications. The measures taken by the Health department are adequate in the current situation but Health officials are worried that if the numbers were to go up, the health system resources could be under strain as more patients would require high-end care. `` People are right now cleaning their houses, which means that even though floodwaters have receded, they are continuously being exposed to infectious agents. It is important that even when on doxycycline, they use personal protective equipment and that they wash their hands well, ''",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/now-morbidity-woes/article24857975.ece,The Hindu,Leptospirosis cases rise in Kerala,It is transmitted through contact of the skin and mucous membranes with water or mud contaminated with rodent urine,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/now-morbidity-woes/article24857975.ece,article,en,NA,2018-09-04T09:33:42Z,,15,0.9375,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Kerala', 'Kerala', 'Weil', 'South Gujarat', 'Kerala'],Host(s):[],Agent(s):['H1N1']","Outbreak:[Leptospirosis cases rise in Kerala., Leptospirosis cases rise in Kerala

A Gutu farmer is counting his losses after officers from 
the Veterinary Services Department shot dead six beasts that he was taking to 
Koala Abbatoir in Harare for slaughter. 
Livestock from Gutu are under quarantine because of a foot 
and mouth outbreak in the area. The cattle which belonged to Gabriel Munguwe 
were intercepted at a roadblock by Chivhu Police. 
The cattle were shot and burnt in Chivhu. 
Director in the Department of Veterinary Services Josphat 
Nyika said Chinguwe moved the cattle outside Gutu without a permit, risking 
spread of foot and mouth disease. 
The Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural 
Resettlement Davis Marapira said farmers should desist from moving cattle 
outside zones that are under quarantine to avoid losses. 
`` Cattle which are moved without permits from 
restricted areas will be destroyed to contain the spread of diseases in green 
areas. Farmers should follow all the necessary procedures when moving their 
cattle to other areas so that they do not lose their livestock 
unnecessarily, '' said Marapira. 
Marapira added that the continued unauthorised movement of 
cattle from infested zones to disease-free areas was hindering the country s 
beef export process as it increased mortality rate of the cattle. 
In June this year, the Chivhu veterinary department 
destroyed 12 cattle that belonged to a local farmer after they were diagnosed 
with foot and mouth disease during a routine inspection.

Hong Kong confirmed its second case of African swine fever ( ASF ) late on Friday, another sign that the disease is continuing its lethal spread beyond mainland China. 
ASF was discovered in a slaughterhouse in the New Territories, bordering China's southern province of Guangdong, said Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan. The government ordered a cull of 4,700 animals and the slaughterhouse was closed Friday night for disinfection. 
The first reported case of ASF in Hong Kong was confirmed three weeks ago at Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse, prompting the government to order the cull more than 6,000 pigs to prevent the spread of the virus. 
The disease has spread to every province on the Chinese mainland since its initial detection in August 2018. On Friday, China reported that it had detected the ASF virus in pigs being illegally transported to its southwestern province of Guizhou. 
ASF is a highly transmissible, deadly disease of pigs, but it does not affect humans. The virus does not affect food safety.

Lesotho is a landlocked country encircled by South Africa. 
Last week, Dr Gerard Relebohile Mahloane, Director General of Veterinary Services, Livestock Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, Maseru, Lesotho reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health of at least 24 cattle deaths and another 106 susceptible. 
Maseru Central Veterinary Laboratory confirmed the anthrax by culture. 
The outbreak is ongoing and authorities in Lesotho have initiated control measures to contain the spread of the disease, namely: quarantine and restriction of movement of cattle within Lesotho, surveillance within the quarantine area, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, zoning, disinfection, and vaccination of animals. 
While government officials in Lesotho confirmed anthrax, skepticism among farmers abound in the country. According to an Eyewitness News report, Lesotho wool and mohair farmers allege that their government is faking an anthrax outbreak to scare South African and international markets from buying their products. 

South African officials say in light of the outbreak in Lesotho, livestock owners in provinces neighboring Lesotho are encouraged to ensure that their livestock is vaccinated against anthrax. Any sudden deaths among livestock in these areas should be reported to the responsible state or private veterinarian or animal health technician for investigation. Carcasses of animals that died suddenly with blood oozing from carcass openings should not be opened or consumed. Animals that are slaughtered at registered abattoirs undergo a thorough examination to ensure meat safety. Trading of animal and animal products takes place in compliance with international recommendations to ensure safe trade.

The animal came from a farm in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and importation from mainland China has been suspended until further notification, Sophia Chan, Secretary of the city's Food and Health Department said on Friday night. 
The government-run slaughterhouse in Sheung Shui will be closed for cleansing and disinfection, she added. 
Shoppers buy frozen meat at a stall after fresh pork sold out at a market in the Mong Kok district in Hong Kong on June 1, 2019. AFP PHOTOLast month around 6,000 pigs were culled after the virus was detected in a pig imported from a farm in the same province. Supply from across the border was temporarily suspended for a week during the disinfection of slaughterhouse. 
Pork is a staple of Chinese cuisine, with space-starved Hong Kong importing the majority of what it consumes from the mainland. 
After African swine fever spread across more than half of China's provinces last year, Hong Kong banned imports from any Chinese farm where the virus had been detected. 
Chinese officials have said hundreds of thousands of pigs were culled in a bid to stop its spread -- an effort that has also seen restrictions on transporting pigs from affected areas. 
With some of the world's most densely populated streets, Hong Kong remains on high alert to diseases. In 2003, some 300 people died during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease ( SARS ). 
The virus is not dangerous to humans but is fatal to pigs and wild boar. 
Meanwhile, South Korean troops stationed along the world's last Cold War frontier have been put on high alert in the face of a new infiltration threat from the nuclear-armed North -- fever-stricken wild boar. 
`` We need to focus on preventing wild boars in the North from entering our territory, '' the South's Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon said on Saturday after visiting a pig farm near the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) that divides the two countries. 
Pyongyang told the World Organization for Animal Health that 77 out of 99 pigs had died from the disease at a farm near the China border, according to Seoul's agricultural ministry. 
The ministry said Friday that the disease is `` highly likely '' to hit the South, and the government has ordered fences to be erected at farms along the border to prevent possible contact between pigs and wild boars. 
Seoul believes Pyongyang raises some 2.6 million pigs across 14 state-run farms. The outbreak could worsen food shortages in the impoverished North, where, according to the World Food Program, its output last year hit the lowest level since 2008. 
In the South, there are about 6,700 pig farms across the country, and pig farming accounts for 40 percent of the total livestock industry. 
In 2011, a devastating outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease hit the entire Korean peninsula and resulted in the culling of nearly 3.5 million cattle, pigs and other animals in South Korea alone.

Import bans 
After the spread of swine fever in more than half of the provinces of China last year, Hong Kong imposed import bans from all Chinese farms where the virus was detected. According to the Chinese authorities, hundreds of thousands of pigs have been slaughtered to contain the spread of the virus, a measure accompanied by a ban on the movement of pigs from the affected areas.

Three birds were found dead near to each other within a matter of days 

Tests have confirmed that two out of three red kites found dead in southern Scotland last month were illegally poisoned. The birds were discovered near Kirkcudbright in early May. Post mortem examinations have shown illegal pesticides were used to kill two of the birds with results on the third still awaited. Police said an investigation was ongoing and have asked for help from the public with information. Det Con Gary Story said they were working closely with the Scottish SPCA and Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture. `` What we have established is that illegal pesticides have been used to kill two of the birds, '' he said.

NYZSTRTCVM,N. Korean state media acknowledges swine flu outbreak,"N. Korean state media acknowledges swine flu outbreak 
The main newspaper of the North Korean regime acknowledged on Wednesday the existence of an outbreak of African swine fever in the country, the first official admission since Pyongyang reported several cases to the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) in May. 
`` Veterinary and emergency anti-epidemic projects have been actively implemented across the country to prevent the spread of African swine fever, which is a highly contagious viral disease, '' an article published by Rodong Sinmun and cited by Efe news said. 

This is the first mention of the disease by the North Korean media since informing the OIE about the outbreak in Chagang province on May 30. 
Since then, South Korea, whose government is concerned about the possible occurrence of the disease on its territory, has offered to cooperate with the North to combat the spread of the dangerous virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever in pigs and has a very high mortality rate, the report said. 
Pyongyang has not responded to the South's offer of cooperation. 
Although it is not known if any fresh cases have been reported in North Korea, the fact that the Rodong article speaks of measures activated `` across the country '' has led to suspicions about the possibility of new cases. 
The current outbreak, which affects east Asia, apparently began in China, where the first case was detected in August 2018 in Liaoning province. 
The virus - which does not affect humans - has already been detected in each of the administrative divisions of China and in other countries including Vietnam and Cambodia, in addition to North Korea, and has already led to the culling of millions of pigs.

B32KRZLHU6,H5N1 high pathogenic avian influenza identified in a recent outbreak in Bangladesh,"H5N1 high pathogenic avian influenza identified in a recent outbreak in Bangladesh 
A team of researchers 
at Bangladesh Agricultural University examined 15 dead or sick birds from 13 clinical outbreaks of avian influenza in Bangladesh. The birds in their sample included ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys. Researchers used RT-PCR ( a laboratory method used to detect genetic material and specific proteins ) to detect the virus that affected the birds in their sample. Results indicated that the birds were infected with a new variety of H5N1 influenza. 
The new iteration of the virus combined various genetic markers from other low pathogenic influenza types that were found in the region since 2013. Researchers hypothesised that this newer version of the virus will supplant the current strain that is infecting poultry and wild birds in Southern Asia. 
The researchers also concluded that the mutations detected in the H5N1 samples could be associated with increases in the virus ' ability to infect mammals and reductions in its susceptibility to antiviral agents.

One more sample, suspected to be Nipah-infected, has been found to be negative for the virus by the National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) in Pune, which has set up its field laboratory at Kochi. The Maharashtra government has, meanwhile, sent instructions to veterinary officers and doctors, asking them to remain alert and keep a watch for unusual mortality among pigs, which are also a carrier of the disease. 
Additional Commissioner of Animal Husbandry Department, Dr D D Parkale, has issued instructions to field staff, regional and deputy commissioners and other personnel to remain vigilant. The protocol followed after the Nipah outbreak in Kerala last year is being put in place again, said Dr V V Limaye, joint commissioner of animal husbandry department, disease investigation section. 
`` Our concern is that pigs are carriers of this disease and it is crucial to immediately quarantine the affected ones, if any. We have instructed mainly veterinary doctors to remain vigilant if they find unusual mortality or sickness among the pigs as this virus is highly contagious in them. They ... develop feverish illness and laboured breathing. It is also called barking pig syndrome, when they have an unusual barking cough, and in such cases Nipah should be suspected, '' said Limaye.

LKR674XJMZ,Bovine Trichomoniasis Found in Oglala Lakota County Herd,"Bovine Trichomoniasis Found in Oglala Lakota County Herd 
PIERRE, SD -- Bovine trichomoniasis ( trich ) has been detected in a South Dakota cattle herd. Two bulls from a beef cattle herd in Oglala Lakota County have tested positive for this economically devastating disease. The Animal Industry Board ( AIB ) is working with the herd owner and their veterinarians to develop a management plan to contain the disease. Neighboring herd owners with potential contact animals will be informed of the risk to their animals as the investigation continues. Trichomonas foetus is a protozoal parasite that is transmitted between cows and bulls during breeding andcan cause early term abortions. Producers are often unaware of the problem until the disease is well established in the herd. Signs that the disease may be present in a herd include a high number of open ( non-pregnant ) and late-calving cows than expected. Producers can take precautions to help prevent their herd from becoming infected. First, only purchase and use virgin bulls for breeding. If non-virgin bulls are used, they should be tested for trich prior to breeding. Bulls may also be tested two weeks after breeding for early detection of potential problems. Timely pregnancy testing of females following the breeding season and prompt removal of open cows to be sold for feeding and slaughter will also decrease the risk of disease spread. Finally, maintain good border fencing to keep livestock in their respective pastures and avoiding unintentional commingling of herds. In cooperation with the cattle industry the AIB has implemented rules in an effort to help prevent trich in cattle: • Non-virgin bulls must be tested negative for trich prior to being sold, loaned or leased in South Dakota for breeding purposes; • Any non-virgin bull entering South Dakota must be tested negative for trich; • Non-virgin, non-pregnant female cattle ( open cows ) may not be imported, loaned, leased nor acquired for breeding purposes in South Dakota. Cattle producers with concerns about trichomoniasis should contact their herd veterinarian or the AIB at 605-773-3321. -- South Dakota Animal Industry Board",https://www.tsln.com/news/bovine-trichomoniasis-found-in-oglala-lakota-county-herd/,NA,Bovine Trichomoniasis Found in Oglala Lakota County Herd,"PIERRE, SD– Bovine trichomoniasis (trich) has been detected in a South Dakota cattle herd.

5SJI5R60ST,Listeria outbreak: three patient deaths linked to chicken sandwiches,"Listeria outbreak: three patient deaths linked to chicken sandwiches 
Three hospital patients have died after eating chicken sandwiches contaminated with listeria bacteria, health officials have announced. 
The three victims, who have not been named, were very unwell and were receiving treatment for serious conditions, according to the officials. Two died under the care of Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust and the other Aintree University Hospital Foundation Trust in Liverpool. 
Six inpatients in total, all with underlying health conditions, fell ill from eating chicken sandwiches supplied by the Good Food Chain. The three survivors are recovering. 
The Good Food Chain ceased production voluntarily this week, as did North Country Cooked Meats, which sold it the chicken, after tests found traces of listeria at its premises. North Country Quality Foods, which distributes North Country Cooked Meats products, has also voluntarily ceased production. 
The Good Food Chain supplies about 40 hospitals across England but is currently not producing the sandwiches and salads under investigation as possible sources of the listeria. Public Health England sources said it was their working assumption that the chicken in the sandwiches was to blame. 
Food Standards Agency officials have been investigating the source of the outbreak. 
PHE sought to reassure the public that they were not in danger. Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of its national infection service, said: `` Our thoughts are with the families of those patients who have died. To date there have been no associated cases identified outside healthcare organisations, and any risk to the public is low. '' 
The Guardian understands that the first patient affected by the listeria fell ill on 25 April. 
Dr Kimon Andreas Karatzas, an associate professor in food microbiology at Reading University, said: `` Listeria monocytogenes is the most deadly foodborne bacteria, mainly associated with ready-to-eat foods that are eaten without any further processing by the consumer. It does not cause a large number of cases but it has a high mortality that can reach up to 30 %. 
`` The company has voluntarily ceased production and hopefully this can put an end to the outbreak. However, due to a relatively long incubation period it's possible that there could potentially be some more cases. '' 
Listeria does not usually cause symptoms worse than some gastrointestinal upset in healthy people, but it can be dangerous for older people, pregnant women and anyone whose immune system is suppressed. 
`` In this small outbreak, there appears a cluster of cases in hospitalised patients that were already ill, '' Karatzas said. `` Listeria can survive at refrigeration temperatures which means it can persist in food processing equipment and in the food chain. ''

ST. GEORGE — Zion National Park officials are concerned for the bighorn sheep herd in the park after discovering that some sheep had contracted a deadly strain of pneumonia.

Pneumonia can be deadly to bighorn sheep, and two have had to be euthanized in the past few weeks in order to diagnose the illness and strain after they found a female with the cough July 20, Zion spokeswoman Aly Baltrus said. 
The park is asking visitors to report any sheep that are displaying symptoms of pneumonia, specifically coughing, so that biologists can track the illness to determine how much of it has already spread.   
“You can hear it from a distance. It’s very much like a human cough,” Baltrus told the Associated Press.
Not all strains of pneumonia are deadly to the animals, but the one affecting those in Zion is, Baltrus told St. George News.
However, at this point, they are unsure what percent of the population will actually be affected. It can vary widely, ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent. The median mortality rate based on past events in other herds is 48 percent.
The signs that a sheep has pneumonia include a cough, nasal discharge, trouble breathing and laziness, but most of the time the diseased animal is found dead, according to a National Park Service article. There is currently no vaccination or cure for bighorn sheep pneumonia.

Pneumonia is relatively common in bighorn sheep. The animals are usually able to fight it off themselves if it is not a deadly strain. The pneumonia that the sheep have is not dangerous to humans.
This is the first case of pneumonia they have seen in the Zion herd. Approximately 500 of the 800 bighorn sheep living in Zion live at the slick rock areas on the east side of the park, Baltrus told the Associated Press.
Pneumonia can spread quickly and easily among the sheep. They can contract it from nose-to-nose contact or when one coughs on another, Jace Taylor, a bighorn sheep biologist with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, told the Associated Press.
Right now the male sheep are beginning to look for mates, making it difficult to contain the spread of pneumonia, Baltrus told the Associated Press.
Visitors who come across an infected sheep should not make contact with the animal, and should report it to Zion National Park at 435-772-0217 or Zion_park_information@nps.gov.

UPDATE 1-China reports first African swine fever outbreak in Guangdong province | Agricultural Commodities 
( Adding analyst comment, prices, and table ) 
BEIJING, Dec 19 ( Reuters ) - China confirmed on Wednesday the 
first African swine fever outbreak in southern Guangdong 
province, as the highly contagious disease continues to spread 
through the world s largest hog herd. 
The outbreak in Zhuhai city in Guangdong province killed 11 
animals in a slaughterhouse, the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Rural Affairs said on its website. 
Guangdong is a major pork consuming region and heavily 
relies on supplies from other provinces. The first outbreak of 
the disease reported there will likely further push up prices in 
the region, analysts said. 
Hog prices in Guangdong province were around 16 yuan ( $ 2.32 ) 
per kg on Wednesday, up 10 percent since early August, when the 
country reported its first African swine fever outbreak, 
according to data provided by consultancy China-America 
Commodity Data Analytics, due to a ban on live hog transport. 
`` Supplies in Guangdong have been quite tight already and 
prices are expected to jump in the long term in the region 
following the new outbreak, '' said Yao Guiling, an analyst with 
the consultancy. 
`` In the very short term, prices might drop, as more farmers 
might rush to send their pigs to slaughter following the 
outbreak, '' said Yao. 
Zhuhai is about 3,000 km from Shenyang in Liaoning province, 
where the country s first outbreak of the disease was found. 
China has reported some 90 cases since then. 
Beijing banned transport of live pigs from regions found 
with outbreaks and neighbouring provinces, in an effort to 
contain spread of the disease. 
The disease is deadly for pigs but does not harm humans. 
The table below shows the number of cases by province, 
according to data reported by the ministry.

JNNAXRDE46,African swine fever captured in Hebei Advanced Pig farm block outbreak,"African swine fever captured in Hebei Advanced Pig farm block outbreak 
`` Epoch February 23, 2019 '', Baoding, Hebei province, Xushui District, a high security class of large pig farms, because of African swine fever attack, one months has killed 15,000 pigs, the outbreak is still expanding. 
Local governments, on the other, blocked news and banned companies from reporting it. An insider who asked to remain anonymous disclosed the news on the same day, Radio Free Asia reported February 21. He said it was estimated to die 800 a day, with more than 700 deaths on 20th and 20 million or 30 million of dollars in losses. 
The point is that the workers have no food to eat, can no longer raise pigs, the industry is very dangerous. The large pig farm is jointly operated by New Hope Group and Hebei Grand afternoon group. 
According to people familiar with the case, the pig farm is a modern pig farm with a high safety level, and it is a special pig farm, so everyone is worried that the industry may have been completely destroyed. Located in Xushui district, Hebei Grand Lunch Agriculture and Pastoral Group Co., Ltd. is a collection of aquaculture, planting, processing industry, industry and other large-scale private enterprises. 
And by Liu Yongxing, Liu Yonghao and other four brothers created by the New Hope Group is one of the top 500 mainland enterprises, mainly engaged in agro-pastoral food, chemical industry, resources and so on. The governor of the Xushui district reportedly claimed to be a political event that prohibited businesses and people from reporting or leaking the outbreak. Local officials issued compensation of 1,200 yuan per pig, asking the people involved in the pig farm to shut up. 
An employee of the pig farm confirmed that she had to obtain permission from her boss to provide up-to-date information on the damage caused by the outbreak. In response to a reporter's inquiry, the Baoding Agriculture bureau in charge of Xushui district also denied that there was an outbreak of African swine fever in the area. 
The Xushui district government also refused to respond to the incident on the grounds of ignorance. Local media sources revealed that there is more than one place in the Xushui district where the outbreak of African swine fever is underreported. In recent days, as many as 70 dead pigs were found in the fields next to Yangcun Provincial road in Baoding. 
And the local control department not only did not sample the test after receiving the report, only by visual inspection on the hasty conclusion that it is not swine fever. Baoding police are still reportedly pursuing netizens who filmed and spread video of dead pigs. 
After being asked about the incident, the duty officer of the city's Bureau of Agriculture said he was unaware. It is not unusual for local authorities in the mainland to conceal the outbreak of swine fever in Africa. Lu Media has quoted the Inner Mongolia Zalantun Party building network released on the December 30, 2018 `` Outbreak News '' disclosure, Liaoning Province, Shenyang City, Anshan, Benxi, Dandong, Jinzhou, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Tieling, Panjin some counties, township government departments in the initial prevention and control work of mutual pushback, 
Some personnel have the problem of deliberately concealing the outbreak information, monitoring and troubleshooting the non-implementation of the responsibility. 
At present, the outbreak of swine fever in Africa continues to spread on the mainland, so far there have been 27 provincial administrative districts, leaving only 4 provinces of Xinjiang, Tibet, Hebei and Hainan without outbreak notification. At the end of December last year, Lai, an authoritative authority in Taiwan's veterinary community, told the US media that the first 5 months of the outbreak in the mainland had spread thousands of kilometers, while African swine fever had expanded at a rate of about 100 kilometers a year, and speculated that it might not be completely related to the mainland's handling of infected pigs. 
He also suspects that the Chinese Communist authorities have reported that the outbreak is opaque. Chen Bingzhong, a former Ministry of Health official of the Communist Party of China, also told overseas new Tang TV that '' [ the Chinese Communist Party ] is concealing the outbreak and the supervision is grossly remiss, then this is the cause of the expansion of the epidemic area.

360a2427f7,Kenya issues alert on foot and mouth disease outbreak - Xinhua,"Kenya issues alert on foot and mouth disease outbreak - Xinhua 
NAIROBI, Feb. 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Kenya on Wednesday issued an alert on mouth and foot disease across the country to help curb its spread. 
Obadiah Nyaga, the director of Veterinary Services in the Ministry of Agriculture, urged Kenyans to report the outbreak of the contagious viral infection immediately to the nearest veterinary office for action. 
`` The disease was detected in the country in 2017 where it spread into 26 counties and has continued to date, '' Nyaga said in a statement. 
He directed all livestock traders to obtain a livestock permit from the local veterinary offices before moving the livestock. 
Nyaga noted that the presence of the disease hinders local and international trade and movement of livestock. 
The disease is characterized by sores and wounds in the mouth and feet causing salivation and lameness that results into heavy losses in milk production, body condition and death especially in young livestock. 
The disease does not have a cure but sick livestock are managed through good feeding and care and treatment of wounds. 
Nyaga however blamed the control of disease to uncontrolled livestock movements due to drought, cattle rustling and roadside grazing. 
`` Very low vaccination converges has left majority of livestock susceptible to disease given that there is 60 million cattle, sheep and goats that require attention, '' he added. 
He revealed that they are worried that some of the outbreaks are linked to an apparent new variant of serotype `` O '' that has not been detected in the country but is in circulation in neighboring countries. 
`` The current vaccine appears to be unproductive but we are upgrading the vaccine to match all serotypes in circulation, '' he added. 
Nyaga said the government has in the meantime embarked on promoting production of vaccines that offer longer immunity like the recently launched oil based vaccines to ease logistics of vaccinations. 
He said the government has also issued guidelines for control measures to be undertaken by the county governments in their efforts to effectively control the disease. 
He directed farmers to disinfect contact materials and equipment and dispose infected carcasses or materials hygienically.",http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/28/c_137006220.htm,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kenya ,8,,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Kenya', 'Kenya', 'Kenya'],Host(s):['cattle', 'goats'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[

Dept reports unprecedented FMD outbreak in Papum Pare 
ITANAGAR, Dec 7: The department of animal husbandry, veterinary & dairy development ( AHV&DD ) on Friday informed that 26 mithuns have died of foot-and-mouth disease ( FMD ) in Papum Pare district since June. 
Stating that this FMD outbreak in Papum Pare is unprecedented, AHV&DD Director Dr ND Minto in a release said 2957 animals have been either treated or vaccinated in the district so far. 
Three mithuns have died in Balijan, five in Tarasso, 12 in Sangdupota and six in Toru circles, the release said. 
No FMD death has so far been reported from Sagalee, Kakoi, Doimukh and Itanagar. 
`` The department is making all-out efforts to contain the disease outbreak. Veterinary camps were organized wherever there was report of FMD, '' Dr Minto said. 
The director said veterinary officers and field personnel equipped with medicines were mobilized since FMD was first reported on 25 June from Tapioso area of Sangdupota circle. 
`` The FMD is basically a viral disease and its symptoms can be seen as lesions in foot and mouth areas in cloven-footed animals. The disease can easily be treated at an early stage. Most deaths occur due to late reporting, '' Dr Minto said. 
The department sought cooperation from the public at the time of biannual vaccination, which is carried out twice every year ( pre-monsoon and post-monsoon ), and urged them to report to the nearest veterinary dispensary or veterinary aid centre if any animal gets sick or is found infected with FMD virus, in order to contain the disease before it spreads to other animals.",https://arunachaltimes.in/index.php/2018/12/08/dept-reports-unprecedented-fmd-outbreak-in-papum-pare/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en-US,NA,NA,NA,9,,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Papum Pare - The Arunachal Times', 'Papum Pare', 'Balijan', 'Tarasso', 'Sangdupota', 'Toru', 'Kakoi', 'Itanagar', 'post-monsoon'],Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Dept reports unprecedented FMD outbreak in Papum Pare - The Arunachal Times., Dept reports unprecedented FMD outbreak in Papum Pare - The Arunachal Times

Flea-borne typhus outbreak hits downtown LA 
Downtown LA is hit by an outbreak of flea-borne TYPHUS amid fears feral cats and rats are spreading the disease. 
Occurs when faeces from an infected flea enter a person s cut or eyes. 
Most sufferers endure mild symptoms like headache, fever and rash. 
In severe cases, it can cause life-threatening hepatitis and internal bleeding By Alexandra Thompson Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline Published: 09:57 GMT, 5 October 2018 | Updated: 16:15 GMT, 5 October 2018 An outbreak of flea-borne typhus has hit downtown LA, the county department of public health has confirmed. At least a dozen cases of the disease, which spreads from fleas to humans, have appeared in a residential neighbourhood of the California city. All of the sufferers live or work in the area, with some being homeless, health officials said. Flea-borne typhus occurs when faeces from an infected insect come into contact with a person s cut or gets rubbed into their eyes. These fleas often live on feral cats and rats who are attracted to areas with trash on the streets. Most sufferers endure headache, fever and rash, however, in severe cases, typhus can lead to life-threatening hepatitis and internal bleeding. An outbreak of flea-borne typhus has hit downtown LA with at least a dozen cases ( stock ) Although typhus normally occurs throughout LA County, we are observing several cases in the downtown Los Angeles area, the city s county health officer Muntu Davis said in a statement. We encourage pet owners to practice safe flea control and encourage all cities in the county to ensure maintenance of their trash clean-up and rodent control activities. WHAT IS FLEA-BORNE TYPHUS? Flea-borne typhus is a bacterial disease that causes fever, headache, rash, muscle ache, and fever and chills. In severe cases, patients can require hospitalisation due to hepatitis or internal bleeding. It is caused by the bacteria Rickettsia typhi and possibly Rickettsia felis, which are carried by fleas. The fleas live on animals, particularly feral and stray cats, rats and opossums, but do not make their host animals unwell. Flea-borne typhus is endemic in parts of LA and Orange County. The disease also often occurs in Texas and Hawaii. Around 200 cases occur every year throughout the US, particularly in coastal regions. Bacteria spread when faeces from an infected flea contaminate a person s cut or graze while the flea is sucking their blood. If the person scratches the flea-bite area, the bacteria from the faeces can enter their bloodstream. Bacteria can also be rubbed into a person s eyes, or, in rare cases, inhaled. Symptoms then appear six-to - 14 days later. Flea-borne typhus can be treated via antibiotics, with most people recovering within a few days. Between two and four percent of people who do not receive treatment die worldwide. Flea-borne typhus can be prevented by avoiding contact with fleas via: Discouraging wild animals around the home. 
Keeping rubbish covered Using flea control on pets. 
Due to the infection taking up to two weeks to cause symptoms, the exact number of sufferers is unclear. Officials are investigating where exactly the cases occurred. NBC reports a dozen people have been struck down. Typhus usually affects around 200 people across the US every year, according to the California Department of Public Health ( CDPH ). Health officials were alerted to the outbreak when a cluster of nine cases occurred in downtown LA between July and August. The infection is endemic in parts of LA and Orange County, Southern California. Fleas carrying the infection can live on cats, rats or opossums, however, the animals themselves do not suffer symptoms. Typhus often spreads in areas where there is an accumulation of trash that attracts wild animals. The infection can not be transmitted from person-to-person and is treatable with antibiotics. There is no vaccine in the US. Up to four percent of people worldwide who are untreated die, the CDPH claims. To prevent infection, LA s public health department recommends residents: Use flea control on pets. 
Tuck their pants into their socks or boots when outside. 
Spray DEET on exposed areas. 
Avoid wild or stray animals, especially rats, cats and opossums. 
Store trash in cans with secure lids to avoid attracting animals. 
Clear areas where stray or feral animals may sleep, hide or seek food, such as attics and under decks This comes after Texas experienced a flea-borne typhus outbreak around this time last year. More than 400 cases occurred from the start of 2017 to the end of November - the highest number for 16 years.

The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries ( DAFF ) has confirmed an outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease ( FMD ) in Limpopo resulted in the withdrawal of its status as a FMD-free zone as declared by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) in January. 
`` Sero-surveillance samples have been taken from all dip tanks and/or crush pens in the disease management area and are being processed at Onderstepoort ( OVR ). 
`` More than 13,000 animals in the previous FMD-free zone will have been vaccinated twice by the end of March 2019. Movement control regulations are still in place and no animals may move out of, into or inside the disease management area without state veterinary approval, '' according to a DAFF statement. 
In addition, said the statement, no processed products of cloven-hoofed animals would be allowed out of the area. Roadblocks and roving patrols were in place to enforce the measures. 
DAFF said it would reapply for `` declaration of a disease containment zone '' before the end of April, which, if successful, would allow for the WHO to reinstate the rest of the country as disease-free. 
The reinstatement had huge implications for safe trade in commodities that included meat of cloven-hoofed animals such as pork and beef slaughtered before December 5, 2018, animal hides and skins, gelatine and collagen, as well as scoured wool. 
South Africa exports meat and meat products to countries including Bahrain, Lesotho, Egypt, Mozambique, Swaziland, Seychelles, Namibia and Qatar. According to DAFF, the approval of a disease containment zone would greatly assist in re-opening trade with these and other trading partners. 
The markets for dairy products had largely been restored. 
`` Though the outbreak is under control, this does not mean that it is resolved and that no further measures will be implemented. It is therefore imperative that all parties that have been instrumental in the success thus far remain committed and work together to resolve this outbreak as soon as possible, '' said the statement.

Bird flu outbreak: Culling of over 200,000 birds to be finished today | Headlines, News, The Philippine Star 
MANILA, Philippines - The Department of Agriculture targets to finish culling more than 200,000 poultry heads today as part of the government s precautionary measure following the first ever bird flu outbreak [ 1 ] in the country. 
? 
The DA is now in the process of culling an estimated 200,000 poultry heads-chicken, ducks, quails, pigeons and fighting roosters-within the town of San Luis in Pampanga to avoid the spread of the virus. 
? 
Pampanga has been placed in a state of calamity since Friday. 
? 
`` At most, we want to finish the depopulation not later than tomorrow [ Monday ]. We will be trying to exhaust all our efforts and resources to finish these until tomorrow. We have to understand that we are not only talking about captive birds, we have to cull those stray birds as well, '' Agriculture Undersecretary Ariel Cayanan said in a phone interview Sunday. 
? 
? 
Last Friday, the DA confirmed the outbreak of avian influenza virus ( bird flu ), the first case for the country, in San Luis, Pampanga which killed close to 40,000 poultry heads and placed the province in a state of calamity. 
? 
Initial field report as to how many heads have been culled already is still under validation. 
? 
Cayanan said Pampanga Gov. Lilia Pineda is shouldering the daily labor cost for the culling process. 
? 
`` She said we can hire as many as we need to fast track depopulation. She will also shoulder all identified logistics all throughout the depopulation period, '' he added. 
? 
Test specimens confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI ) subtype H5 in the town of San Agustin in San Luis, Pampanga, killing 37,000 birds covering six farms particularly poultry, quail and ducks. 
? 
According to Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pi?ol, quarantine officers will disinfect all the six farms after all birds in the area have been culled. 
? 
`` After 21 days, sentinel birds will be deployed in the affected farms to serve as the basis in determining whether the virus is still present in the area. If the sentinel birds will not show signs of the disease, the quarantine restrictions will be lifted after 90 days, '' Pi?ol said. 
Controlling the spread 
The department maintained that culling the rest of the poultry population in the area is necessary to control the spread of disease in the shortest possible time as the remaining 200,000 may also be infected with bird flu. 
? 
The Bureau of Animal Industry has already declared a quarantine zone within a one-kilometer radius of the farms where the outbreak was confirmed. 
? 
Another seven-kilometer radius has been declared as a controlled zone where no fowls, eggs or other products could be brought out. 
? 
? 
Apart from confining the area, the department has ordered the ban on the shipment of fowls from Luzon to the other parts of the country. 
? 
`` However, the transshipment through the Manila International Airport of chicks, hatching eggs and other fowls from other countries coming into Luzon or other parts of the country will be allowed with the advisory that stringent quarantine protocols must be observed, '' Pi?ol said. 
? 
This means that chicken brought in from the United States intended for shipment to the Visayas or Mindanao may not be taken out of the boxes and must be loaded directly into the connecting flights. 
Low chance of virus transmission to humans 
On the other hand, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Biodiversity Management Bureau warned the public on approaching migratory birds in light of fears that the current bird flu outbreak is caused by the birds. 
? 
`` We discourage the killing or poaching of the birds because this could just worsen the situation. Close contact with the birds will risk transmission, '' DENR-BMB? Director Mundita Lim said. 
? 
`` We may need to determine the actual strain and do some epidemiological assessments so we can make the proper disease management recommendations, along with the DA and the DOH, in accordance with the creation of an inter-agency committee on zoonosis, '' she added. 
? 
Zoonosis is a disease that can be transmitted to humans from animals. 
? 
There has been no report yet of poultry to human contamination and the DOH assured that virus transmission from animals to humans is low. 
? 
? 
BAI is now in the process of sending the samples to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, a World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) Reference Laboratory for avian influenza for further testing. 
? 
The DENR explained that the annual bird migration season in the Philippines is expected to start around September ( southward migration ) and return to their breeding grounds by March in the following year ( northward migration ). 
? 
This means that birds stop briefly along wetlands-swamps, marshes, intertidal and coastal areas, rivers, ponds, lakes, as well as forests throughout the country, to rest and refuel for their onward journey. 
? 
The DENR will also issue a memorandum to all its regional directors to intensify surveillance at airports and seaports pertaining to the smuggling of wild birds.

A2CGJOV84Z,"Foot and mouth disease outbreak in Nichula, Dagana","Foot and mouth disease outbreak in Nichula, Dagana 
The movement of live animals and dairy products including meat from Nichula gewog in Dagana is strictly banned from yesterday after an outbreak of foot and mouth diseases ( FMD ) in cattle were reported from the gewog. 
According to a notification issued by Dagana dzongdag Phintsho Choeden yesterday, the ban was to prevent further spread of the disease to other places and as per the Livestock Act. 
Dzongkhag Livestock officer, Pema Wangchuk, said the first case was reported on December 22 from Chakramari in Gangtokha chiwog and Maula herd in Nichula gewog. 
The notification states that the source of the outbreak is suspected to be from across the border area ( Assam, India ) as cross-border grazing is a common practice along the border. 
Foot and mouth disease is a severe and highly contagious viral disease that mostly causes illness in cows, pigs, sheep, goat and other animals with divided hooves. 
Pema Wangchuk said that as per the information from the gewog extension office, four cattle in Chakramari and 42 in Maula herd were affected by the FMD as of yesterday. 
`` After the case was reported, the officials at the gewog extension office immediately went to the site and started necessary treatments to the cattle like antibiotic treatment and foot and mouth wash, '' Pema Wangchuk said. 
No deaths in the cattle were reported as of now. 
Pema Wangchuk said that while the infected area is away from settlement in the gewog, ring vaccination has been carried out to prevent spreading of the disease. 
Ring vaccination controls an outbreak by vaccinating and monitoring a ring of individual or cattle around each infected individual or cattle. The idea is to form a buffer of immune individuals to prevent the spread of the disease. 
Both Chakramari, which is near Assam in India and Maula herd is about three to four hours walk from the gewog centre. 
Officials from the Dzongkhag Livestock office including the dzongkhag veterinary officer would visit the site today and take samples for further investigation. `` Only after that, we would know what to do next. Meanwhile, we will continue with the treatment and preventive measures. '' 
This is the first case of FMD reported in the dzongkhag this year. The ban on the movement of live animals and dairy products from the gewog would continue until further notice.

CV11CIK7P6,China reports new outbreak of African swine fever,"China reports new outbreak of African swine fever 
BEIJING -- China has reported a new outbreak of African swine fever that is threating the country's vital pork industry. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs reported Friday the disease had been detected on a farm in Yongzhou in the central province of Hunan, where 4,600 pigs were being raised. Although just 171 of the pigs had died and 270 were found sick, ministry regulations require all pigs on an affected farm must be culled and disposed of and the area quarantined and decontaminated. First detected in August, the disease has killed more than 1 million pigs in China, prompting restrictions on shipments of most of China's 700 million swine, even healthy ones. That has disrupted supplies of pork, China's staple meat, to big cities while prices collapsed in areas with an oversupply of pigs that farmers are barred from shipping to other provinces. It also resulted in additional stress on pig farmers already beset by rising feed costs from Beijing's tariff fight with President Donald Trump. African swine fever does n't affect humans but is highly contagious in pigs. Dozens of cases have been detected over recent months in at least 20 provinces. It was n't clear how the virus reached China, but it was found to be genetically similar to versions in Russia, Poland and Georgia. The outbreak could cause longer-term disruption if farmers respond to lower prices and higher costs by raising fewer pigs, leading to shortages and higher prices. The government maintains stocks of frozen pork in case of shortages but has yet to say whether any will be released this year. Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

WFX9MEW25R,USDA's Efforts to Prepare for a Potential Outbreak Could Be Strengthened,"USDA's Efforts to Prepare for a Potential Outbreak Could Be Strengthened 
What GAO Found 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's ( USDA ) planned approach for responding to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease ( FMD ) includes several strategies. These strategies generally rely on killing infected and susceptible animals, vaccinating uninfected animals, or a combination of both approaches. USDA would implement one or more of the strategies, depending on factors such as the outbreak's size and the resources available, according to agency documents. 

USDA would likely face significant challenges in pursuing its response goals of detecting, controlling, and containing FMD quickly; eradicating FMD while seeking to stabilize industry and the economy; and facilitating continuity of commerce in uninfected animals. GAO identified challenges in 11 areas -- including allocating a limited supply of FMD vaccine -- based on its review of USDA documents, responses to GAO's questionnaire, and interviews with agency officials and others with expertise on FMD. According to USDA, the agency may not have a sufficient supply of FMD vaccine to control more than a small outbreak because of limited resources to obtain vaccine. As shown below, the current vaccine supply would be sufficient to protect about 14 percent of Texas's cattle or about 4 percent of Iowa's swine; these states ' cattle and swine populations are the nation's largest. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 includes a provision to increase the FMD vaccine supply. 

Foot-and-Mouth Disease ( FMD ) Vaccine Doses Needed to Protect Cattle and Swine in Texas and Iowa, Compared with Vaccine Doses Available, 2018 

USDA has identified dozens of corrective actions to mitigate the challenges of responding to an FMD outbreak, as called for in USDA procedures, but has not prioritized these corrective actions or monitored their completion, as also called for in its procedures. USDA has identified the corrective actions through exercises simulating FMD outbreaks, surveys, and lessons learned from other foreign animal disease outbreaks. However, USDA has not completed all of the corrective actions, including actions related to vaccination. Agency officials stated that they have not completed such corrective actions because they have been responding to outbreaks of other animal diseases and have limited resources. Without following agency procedures to prioritize and monitor corrective actions, USDA can not ensure that it is allocating its resources to the most beneficial actions to prepare for a possible FMD outbreak. 

Why GAO Did This Study 

FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that causes painful lesions on the hooves and mouths of some livestock, making it difficult for them to stand or eat, thus greatly reducing meat and milk production. The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but FMD is present in much of the world. An FMD outbreak in the United States could have serious economic impacts, in part because trade partners would likely halt all imports of U.S. livestock and livestock products until the disease was eradicated. These imports were valued at more than $ 19 billion in 2017. 

GAO was asked to review USDA's efforts to prepare for an FMD outbreak. This report examines ( 1 ) USDA's planned approach for responding to an FMD outbreak; ( 2 ) challenges USDA would face in pursuing its response goals; and ( 3 ) how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to mitigate the challenges. GAO observed a USDA FMD preparedness exercise; reviewed agency documents and nongeneralizable questionnaire responses from 29 respondents from federal and state government, livestock industries, and universities; and interviewed officials from federal and state governments and representatives of livestock industries and universities. 

What GAO Recommends 

GAO is recommending that USDA follow its procedures to prioritize and monitor the completion of corrective actions that the agency has identified for FMD preparedness. USDA agreed with these recommendations, and described actions it will take to implement them.

DAQMP5WI7E,South Korea ramps up disinfection to protect against North's outbreak of African swine fever,"South Korea ramps up disinfection to protect against North's outbreak of African swine fever 
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korea will boost disinfection measures to prevent an outbreak of African swine fever from spreading to its pig herd, after the disease was found in North Korea, the agriculture ministry said on Friday. FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: A pig is seen on the farm of pig farmer Han Yi at a village in Changtu county, Liaoning province, China, January 17, 2019. / File Photo. 
There is no vaccine for the highly contagious disease fatal to pigs, but which does not affect humans. It spread rapidly across China after being detected there last August, and has also been reported in Vietnam. The North's outbreak was confirmed on Saturday at a farm in its province of Jagang near the border with China, South Korea's agriculture ministry said in a statement, with more than 20 hogs culled and more than 70 dead from the virus. `` There is a possibility that the virus could spread to the South and we plan to carry out extra disinfection measures, '' Oh Soon-min, the ministry's director general, told a news briefing after a government meeting on ways to block the virus. Measures will include stepping up disinfection in areas near the shared border, the ministry said. South Korea's unification ministry said it would make use of a liaison office with its reclusive neighbor to work out detailed protection measures with the North. Pork, cheaper than beef, is a popular meat in South Korea, which had about 11.2 million pigs in the first quarter, data from Statistics Korea shows. North Korea has not confirmed the swine fever outbreak, but the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Friday carried three articles on the risks posed by the virus and its rapid spread. However, South Korea's agriculture ministry said its neighbor had reported the outbreak to the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) on Thursday, and took steps to control its spread, including disinfection. LACK OF PREVENTION CAPABILITY The North's outbreak comes as it grapples with food shortages, when four in ten citizens are going hungry after the worst harvest in a decade, the United Nations said this month. `` The food and nutrition insecurity situation in North Korea is worrying and the African swine fever outbreak puts additional pressure on the availability of proteins of animal origin, '' said Vincent Martin, an official of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization in China and North Korea. The North's pork consumption has increased recently as leader Kim Jong Un pushed to increase meat supply, said Kwon Tae-jin of the GSnJ Institute, an expert on its agriculture. `` It will mainly affect the elite because not every North Korean can easily eat pork or other types of meat, '' he said, referring to the virus outbreak. `` The biggest concern is lack of sanitary and prevention capability. '' North Korea raises mainly chicken, ducks and rabbits, but its pig population in 2017 rose 8.9 % on the year to 2.6 million, according to Statistics Korea. South Korean pork producers worry that wild boars near the border could carry in the virus, hitting pig farms. `` Prevention is the best way to counter the virus, '' said Oh Yu-hwan, an official of the Korea Pork Producers ' Association. `` The government should step up controlling wild boars, otherwise it could threaten the foundation of the industry. '' The government plans to build more fences to protect farm animals from wild boars and relax rules on hunting them, the ministry said. However, the average retail price of pork belly changed little in South Korea, standing at 1,857 won ( $ 1.56 ) per 100 gram ( 0.22 lb ) on May 30 from 1,854 won a year earlier, data from state-run Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp shows. Shares of South Korean animal medicine suppliers, Eagle Veterinary Technology and Cheil Bio rallied as much as 23 % and 16 %, respectively, while those of animal feed maker Woosung Feed jumped more than 12 %.

India reports bird flu outbreak 
An outbreak of the highly pathogenic bird flu strain H5N8, which ripped through Asia, Europe and the Middle East in the last 12 months, has been reported in India, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ). The Paris-based organisation said the outbreak was confirmed by a report it had received from Devendra Chaudhry, secretary for the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, a branch of India s Ministry of Agriculture. In total, 942 birds were culled. The report did not specify whether the avian animals were commercial poultry or wild birds.A source of the outbreak remains inconclusive at this stage, according to the OIE. Control measures have been set up by the Indian government: movement restrictions inside the country have been established; surveillance outside the contamination zone is underway; farms within the containment zone are being checked for traces of the bird flu strain; and officials are disposing of carcases, by-products and avian waste in Karnataka. The outbreak is a reoccurrence of the H5N8 bird flu strain. India suffered multiple outbreaks of the strain in 2017 and 2016.

Niger Rift Valley Fever outbreak could spread across borders: health experts 
| Reuters 
DAKAR ( Thomson Reuters Foundation ) - An outbreak of Rift Valley fever that has killed at least 28 people in western Niger in recent months could spread to neighboring Mali and Algeria, health officials warned on Monday. The highly contagious disease, which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes or close contact with contaminated animals, has infected 90 people in Niger s western region of Tahoua since early August, according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ). With no specific treatment or effective human vaccine, Rift Valley fever can cause blindness and severe hemorrhaging, leading the victim to vomit blood or even bleed to death. There is a high risk that the disease could spread to the West African nation s neighbors amid insecurity in the region, the movement of nomadic herdsmen and limited health facilities in the affected areas, the WHO said in a statement. 
`` Herders migrating with their livestock pose the biggest risk of the epidemic crossing borders, '' Oumarou Maidadji, medical coordinator for The Alliance for International Medical Action ( ALIMA ), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. The danger is particularly acute at present following a recent festival in the region that gathered nomadic groups and their cattle from several neighboring countries, he added. Herders and farmers are deemed at higher risk of infection from the disease, which can devastate livestock, and account for most of the 90 cases recorded so far, according to the WHO. 
People in Tahoua should avoid handling meat from infected animals, boil raw milk before consumption, and ensure corpses of dead animals are buried carefully, Niger s health ministry said last month after confirming the outbreak.ALIMA has opened an emergency treatment center - in the hardest-hit district of Tchintabaraden - to look after the ill, and is working with partners including the Red Cross to inform the public about the disease and how to stop it from spreading. 
The WHO said it has sent a team of experts to the region and set up a mobile laboratory, but warned that cases could be going undetected. `` The risk that only severe cases are being detected and reported can not be ruled out, '' it said in a statement.

G6PZI2A73U,West Nile virus found near Fresno State campus,"West Nile virus found near Fresno State campus 
The Fresno County Department of Public Health ( FCDPH ) issued a warning regarding the West Nile virus ( WNV ) on Friday. 
According to the FCDPH website, mosquitoes collected within the City of Fresno have tested positive for the virus. The mosquitoes were found around the 93710 ZIP code, which includes the Fresno State campus. 
`` This confirmation is a strong reminder that everyone should take this disease seriously and should take every precaution to protect themselves and their families from mosquito bites, '' says Leticia Berber, Health Educator Fresno County Department of Public Health. 
Precautionary measures include contacting local mosquito control district regarding standing water or mosquito problems, as well as to report any neglected swimming pools and practicing the `` three Ds '' proposed by the FCDPH. 
DEET 
For those who may be in areas where they may come in contact with mosquitos they should apply insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535, according to the FCDPH. 
DAWN AND DUSK 
The most common time of day that mosquitoes are at their height of activity is in the early morning and evening. To avoid having mosquitoes enter homes, residents in the area should make sure that their doors and windows remain closed during these times, and have tight-fitting screens to keep mosquitoes out. Residents should repair or replace screens that have tears or holes as soon as possible. 
DRAIN 
Mosquitoes are attracted to and lay eggs in areas with standing water. The release suggests that people eliminate all sources of standing water by emptying flower pots, old car tires, buckets, and other containers. Also all swimming pools should be properly maintained. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention symptoms and signs of WNV include fever, headache, body aches, skin rash and swollen lymph nodes to those who have been bitten. In some cases a small percentage can cause serious, and sometimes fatal, illness.

Z1L4S3AS0A,China’s swine flu has changed dry bulk patterns for years to come,"China's swine flu has changed dry bulk patterns for years to come 
Forget Vale's disastrous start to the year, the real pain point for dry bulk -- and one that will last years and change global trading patterns -- is the disastrous impact of African swine flu in China. The outbreak of African swine fever in the world's most populous nation and largest soybean buyer is reducing soybean imports massively. The deadly pig disease spreading through China is likely to reshape the global soybean market for years to come. Noel White, the boss of Tyson Foods, America's largest meat-packing firm, said last month that in his 39 years in the business he had `` never seen an event that has the potential to change global protein production and consumption patterns '' as much as China's epidemic of African swine fever. China is the global leader in pork consumption and requires an enormous quantity of soybeans to crush into high-protein meal to feed its hog herd, the world's largest, with the US serving as the world's largest supplier of soybeans. The disease broke out in August last year, with Chinese official reports ever since under playing the severe extent of the crisis.A report released by international shipowning body BIMCO last week showed the real negative impact on the dry bulk market from the deadly swine disease, citing import data into China. The report had some very big figures to digest for dry bulk owners. China has 56 % of the world's pigs, according to data provider Statista. As much as a third ( 130m ) of all Chinese pigs may be culled because of African swine fever, according to estimates by industry sources. `` From a dry bulk shipping perspective, this is a significant amount of lost soya bean tonne-miles, mainly from Brazil and the US. On the other hand, reefer containers may benefit from increased imports of pork to make up for the lost domestic production at an unchanged level of consumption, '' BIMCO said in the report. Chinese imports of soya beans have dropped by 14.4 % ( 2.8 m tonnes less ) in the first quarter this year compared with the same period last year. This extends the decline, as Chinese imports already dropped by 7.1 m tonnes in November - December 2018 from the previous year, BIMCO noted.A recent report by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) estimated China's soybean imports are estimated to fall to 84m tons in marketing year 18/19 and 83m tonnes in 19 / 20, compared to 94.1 m tonnes in 17 / 18. Meanwhile, China's rapeseed imports from Canada are expected to fall by almost 40 % during the second half of 18/19 compared to the same period in the previous year, due to reported phytosanitary concerns. Randy Giveans, vice president of equity research at Jefferies, told Splash that the disease combined with the ongoing trade war with the US is likely to mean the global soybean trade will shrink in 2019 for the first time in over a decade. Rahul Sharan, Drewry's lead analyst for dry bulk shipping, has tracked declining soybean imports throughout the last 12 months. `` Towards the end of 2018, Brazilian soybean prices also declined indicating a sluggishness in demand, '' Sharan observed. `` The problem is that -- China has not been able to contain the spread of the disease, and worse even -- it is spreading into other countries such as Vietnam. Vietnam is also a soybean importer and due to swine fever Vietnam has also started culling pigs. If it continues this way, soybean trade could further contract this year, '' Sharan added. Darin Friedrichs, senior Asia commodity analyst at financial services company INTL FCStone, has the official data, telling readers China's soybean imports were down 4.42 m tonnes to 31.75 m tonnes from January to May this year. `` The average size of each shipment is probably 66k MT. This comes out to 67 less bulk shipments to China, '' Friedrichs told Splash. The swine fever situation in China will lead to a shift towards containerised imports of meat, and away from bulk imports of grain, according to Friedrichs. `` Normally China is importing grain to feed animals domestically, but swine fever has reduced the hog herd. China will be shifting to importing pork, and other proteins like beef and chicken from other countries which will mean a shift to more refrigerated containers, '' Friedrichs concluded.",https://splash247.com/chinas-swine-flu-has-changed-dry-bulk-patterns-for-years-to-come/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,9,,403,Restricted,"Location(s):['China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'America', 'China', 'China', 'US', 'China', 'China', 'Brazil', 'US', 'China', 'China', 'Canada', 'Jefferies', 'US', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'Asia', 'China', 'MT', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China'],Host(s):['pig', 'pigs', 'chicken'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[The disease broke out in August last year, with Chinese official reports ever since under playing the severe extent of the crisis., A report released by international shipowning body BIMCO last week showed the real negative impact on the dry bulk market from the deadly swine disease, citing import data into China., The report had some very big figures to digest for dry bulk owners., On the other hand, reefer containers may benefit from increased imports of pork to make up for the lost domestic production at an unchanged level of consumption, '' BIMCO said in the report., A recent report by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) estimated China's soybean imports are estimated to fall to 84m tons in marketing year 18/19 and 83m tonnes in 19 / 20, compared to 94.1 m tonnes in 17 / 18., Meanwhile, China's rapeseed imports from Canada are expected to fall by almost 40 % during the second half of 18/19 compared to the same period in the previous year, due to reported phytosanitary concerns.],No. of outbreak Sentences:6",Insufficient Metadata,NA,8,,"Spatial Entities---['China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'America', 'China', 'China', 'US', 'China', 'China', 'Brazil', 'US', 'China', 'China', 'Canada', 'Jefferies', 'US', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'Vietnam', 'Asia', 'China', 'MT', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China']","Temporal Entities---['years', 'the year', 'last years', 'last month', 'his 39 years', 'August last year', 'last week', 'the first quarter this year', 'the same period last year', 'November - December 2018', 'the previous year', 'year 18/19', '19 / 20', '17 / 18', 'the second half of 18/19', '2019', 'over a decade', 'the last 12 months', 'the end of 2018', 'this year', 'January to May this year']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['pig', 'pigs', 'chicken'],Agent(s):[]",,0.55
I63W0ETUJX,Authorities vigilant but downplay local concerns as African swine fever sweeps Asia,"Authorities vigilant but downplay local concerns as African swine fever sweeps Asia 
GEORGE TOWN, June 17 -- Malaysia has adequate pork and pig product supplies to meet local demand, Sim Tze Tzin said amid concern that an African swine fever ( ASF ) outbreak may disrupt availability. The agriculture and agro-based industries deputy minister also said locally available pork and pig products were safe for consumption, but cautioned against piglets as these were commonly sourced from Vietnam due to limited production here. Sim pointed out that Malaysia has banned imports of pig and pig products from countries affected by the ASF, including Vietnam. `` Yet, we still see roasted piglets are being served in Chinese restaurants, so there are now concerns about illegal smuggling in of pigs and pig products into the country, '' he told Malay Mail when contacted. He advised consumers to avoid consuming piglets as a precaution and to eliminate demand for black market suppliers. Sim's ministry has also launched border control operations to stop these activities. `` We are working with Customs, Maqis and the border security agency to tighten our borders and to stop illegal smuggling of pigs and pig products into our country, '' he said, referring to the Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services. Currently, seaports and the Thailand border are under heavy monitoring for smuggling attempts. The ministry and the Department of Veterinary Services ( DVS ) are also on high alert to prevent the spread of ASF to Malaysian pig farms, but Sim expressed concern that not all agencies may be aware of the urgency and threat to the biosecurity of pig farms here. None has yet been arrested for smuggling pigs into Malaysia, but Sim said vigilance was still critical. Even passengers coming from ASF affected countries will have their hand luggage checked to ensure that they do not bring in inadvertently bring in contaminated pig products from their home countries, he added. On the home front, the deputy minister said the DVS and his ministry have also been educating local pig farmers on how to increase biosecurity in their farms. The recommended measures include securing their farm fencing to prevent wild animals from encroaching and ensuring the feed given to the pigs are from known and safe sources. `` They must not feed the pigs with products of unknown sources, such as food wastes which is very dangerous and can compromise the biosecurity of the farms, '' he said. He said pig farmers were also advised not to visit other farms in countries with ASF as they could inadvertently bring back contaminated items that could then spread to their farms here. Pig farmers must be responsible in protecting their farms by adhering to set guidelines, Sim stressed before urging farmers to immediately inform the authorities if they detect any signs of ASF infection. This was so these could be quickly quarantined to try and reduce the risk of further outbreak. `` As long as the pig farmers cooperate with us, we are safe from ASF but we must always be on high alert to prevent it, '' he said. Sim also assured the public that the ASF was non-communicable to humans and there was no need for health concerns. Malaysia banned the import of pork and pig products from China, Poland, Belgium, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia as a precautionary measure against a regional outbreak of the ASF. According to the Federation of Livestock Farmers Association Malaysia ( FLFAM ), the ban will not affect the prices of local pork supplies.FLFAM pig unit acting chairman David Lee said pork prices may have risen in affected countries, but remained between RM6 .80 and RM7 .80 per kilogramme here on average. He said there are over 500 pig farms in the country that provided sufficient supply for Malaysian consumers. `` About 93 per cent of our pork in the country are locally supplied, so imported pork only makes up a small portion, '' he told the Malay Mail when contacted.

5ZN4BOLAPB,Liam Dann: Swine fever casts new shadow on global economy,"Liam Dann: Swine fever casts new shadow on global economy 
COMMENT: The swine fever epidemic has been described by scientists as the biggest animal disease outbreak we 've ever had on the planet. Given that scale it seems a bit of an understatement to talk about the butterfly effect. That's the idea that a small event somewhere can have implications that ripple far and wide -- i.e. a butterfly's wings cause a tiny atmospheric disturbance which snowballs to result in a hurricane on the other side of the world. It is relevant in the sense that this news story still looks a distant - dramatic but far removed. New Zealand is constantly being buffeted by the chaotic fallout of global events. But the ripple effect of this one has the potential to change our economic equations. It could yet rival the much higher profile US/China trade war for a place in the world's social, economic and political history. Food supply has that kind of power. And while New Zealand is not a significant pork producer, our fortunes are tied inextricably to protein production. It's as a major disruption to global protein markets that we should view crisis. China's population of pigs will shrink by 134 million heads, or 20 per cent, this year, the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) says. That puts pressure on China to import the meat -- estimated by the USDA to rise 41 per cent this year to 2.2 million tonnes -- to make up for the shortfall. But that's just the start. Customers buy frozen pork at a local market in Hong Kong. Photo / AP Bloomberg reports that while official estimates count 1 million culled hogs, slaughter data suggest 100 times more will be removed from China's 440 million-strong swine herd in 2019. Christine Mc. 
Cracken, senior animal protein analyst at Rabobank, has estimated that 200 million pigs could eventually be culled in China -- more than half the pigs in the country, which supplies around 50 per cent of the world's pork. Thankfully, the disease does n't effect humans but it is spreading - through Mongolia, Vietnam and Cambodia and now into Eastern Europe. `` This is the biggest animal disease outbreak we 've ever had on the planet, '' Dirk Pfeiffer, a veterinary epidemiologist in Hong Kong and expert on African swine fever, told The Guardian. `` It makes the foot and mouth disease and BSE outbreaks pale in comparison to the damage that is being done. And we have no way to stop it from spreading. '' Despite a spike of roughly 40 per cent in pork prices, they still have n't topped relatively recent highs hit in 2016. So in terms of market impact we have n't really seen anything yet. But it is almost certainly coming. All the signs are pointing to a market shift of historic proportions. Global food scares are often a double-edged sword for New Zealand. As long as they are n't directly happening to us they tend to be positive for our export prices. Beef and Lamb NZ chief executive Sam Mc. 
Ivor told the Herald this week that the outbreak had given the New Zealand meat sector a boost, both in terms of value and volume. From January to April, sheepmeat exports to the PRC shot up to 95,000 tonnes from 75,000 tonnes at the same time last year. For beef, exports almost doubled to 67,000 tonnes from 36,000 tonnes over the same comparative periods. In terms of value, beef receipts shot to $ 476 million from January to April from $ 244m a year earlier. A worker pushes a beef carcass at the meatworks in Horotiu. Photo / File We may even see the impending pork shortage drive demand for lamb and dairy products. Economists who look at food consumption trends tend to group foods by nutritional class. When dairy prices spiked too high several years ago we saw cheese consumption drop as consumers switched to alternative proteins. The price followed. But these things are never simple and there are risks for New Zealand This is clearly not good news for China's economy -- already struggling with the trade war and slowing consumer demand. Any headwinds to the Chinese economy eventually flow through to New Zealand in terms of consumer demand for our higher end products and in tourist numbers. Meanwhile there are also risks of other undesirable trade outcomes. As a response, China has started to relax meat import restrictions for less favoured nations. If the nation opens up to more sheep and beef from the likes of India, Russia and Mongolia then there is a risk New Zealand exporters could lose some of the competitive advantage they enjoy as part of the Free Trade Agreement. Events like this can come out of the blue and change the all equations for economists. Given the forecasters are already up to their neck in the global politics of trade wars, oil, tech disruption and low inflation this is hardly a welcome addition. If all this was n't enough of a big deal, we should also consider the fundamental place that food supply issues have in much of the big social upheavals of history. From the French Revolution to the Arab Spring, food shortages and price shocks are notorious for sparking social unrest, popular uprising and political change. The final fall-out from this outbreak is impossible to predict. Perhaps it wil be managed and controlled by the Chinese authorities with minimal impact outside of the meat trade. But it will be a stern test of Beijing's power.

A virus decimating China's hog industry is likely to benefit Finnish meat processors who are selling more pork to cover shortages caused by African swine fever. Juha Gröhn, CEO of Finnish meat company Atria, said the firm's exports to pork-loving China could double this year as African swine fever sweeps over the country which produces half of the world's pork. With outbreaks reported in every part of mainland China, some analysts predict up to 200 million pigs could die or be culled this year, causing a huge shortage of pork locally. This year Atria expects to export five to seven million kilos of pork to China -- the world's largest consumer of pork. Atria, which began pork exports to China two years ago, now expects a temporary spike in demand. The company is, however, not planning to up production to avoid running the risk of a surplus. `` Most likely China will solve the problem, shrinking export opportunity, '' Gröhn explained. Finnish food group HKScan, which has been exporting to China for the past year, told Yle its products were fetching slightly higher prices in the Chinese market. `` Our goal in the first year was three million kilos, increasing to nine million kilos by year three, '' said Jukka Nikkinen, HKScan export director.

China's increased demand for foreign pork has already raised global prices. In the EU, the average price for 100 kilos of pork has jumped from 135 euros in February to 175 euros. Spain and Germany are the EU's main pork exporters, with the bloc's sales expected to grow by 11 percent this year over 2018, according to Pellervo Economic Research PTT. Finnish pork producers have faced sustainability problems, which is why the Finnish agricultural lobby group MTK said it hoped the upward price pressure brought on by Chinese demand would trickle down to farmers. `` This is a welcome boost if it also raises producer prices, '' said Marjukka Manninen of the MTK. Johannes Piipponen of Pellervo said he believed Chinese consumers will eventually turn to chicken and beef as scarcity drives up pork prices. But HKScan said it believed in the power of pork. `` Pork is a central part of Chinese cuisine, and it's on the dinner table every night, '' Nikkinen said. While African swine fever does n't pass from pigs to humans, it is a major threat to pork production globally as no effective vaccine or treatment exists.",https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/african_swine_fever_epidemic_benefits_finnish_meat_industry/10834530,News,African swine fever epidemic benefits Finnish meat industry,China’s pork shortage may be an opportunity for Finnish meat producers.,https://yle.fi/a/3-10834530,article,en,NA,2019-06-16T13:57:25+03:00,NA,15,0.9375,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Vatsyayana', 'China', 'Spain', 'Germany'],Host(s):['pigs', 'chicken', 'humans'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[With outbreaks reported in every part of mainland China, some analysts predict up to 200 million pigs could die or be culled this year, causing a huge shortage of pork locally.],No. of outbreak Sentences:1",Sufficient Metadata,News,11,0.611111111,"Spatial Entities---['China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Vietnam', 'Vatsyayana', 'China', 'Spain', 'Germany']","Temporal Entities---['this year', 'two years ago', 'the past year', 'the first year', 'year three', 'February', '2018']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['pigs', 'chicken', 'humans'],Agent(s):[]",0.79,0.87
W88SSFT7A0,PPA: Seoul investigates sending diagnostic equipment to North Korea,"More and more voices are being raised to highlight the need to provide aid to North Korea, which has been affected by African Swine Fever (APP), which has a mortality rate of up to 100%. In this context, the South Korean government is preparing to send sanitary equipment across the border.

Among them is the real-time chain polymerization reaction machine (PCR). It can diagnose not only PPA but also other outbreaks such as foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza. Its price is relatively high, between 37,000 and 74,000 euros per unit.

This equipment is not installed on a farm but in a laboratory. The examination takes place on a sample and it takes an average of four hours to know the result. However, some believe he may be affected by international sanctions against Kim Jong-un's regime. Hence the need to initiate the exemption procedure.

South Korea has not seen any cases of African swine fever, while the disease has caused havoc in several Asian countries such as China, Vietnam and Cambodia. However, in the face of the outbreak in North Korea, the South Korean authorities are seeking to prevent its spread by various means.

OM0SYPVZ7I,African Swine Plague: A Belgian Mystery,"Polish wild boars transported to Belgium?

In mid-September 2018, two carcasses of wild boars carrying African swine fever were found in Belgium, ten kilometres from the French border. While the mystery remains as to this disease, which came from Eastern Europe but spanned Germany, an investigation is still under way in the hunting community.

African swine fever was previously restricted to eastern Europe due to high mortality in the white as a man (bloodhounds, pigs) but safe for humans. Detected on European soil in 2012, the virus first spread from Ukraine to Russia, before entering the European Union in 2014 (Lithuania, Latvia, Poland) and then in 2017 in the Czech Republic and Romania.

Without knowing which path it took, the disease was found in mid-September 2018 in two carcasses of wild boars on the Walloon commune of Etalle, near the French border. Faced with the economic danger to the hog industry, preventive measures were quickly put in place. Notably on the French side, with the establishment of a 'white zone' (Ardennes, Meuse, Meurthe-et-Moselle) in which all wild boars are to be slaughtered.

Highly suspected hunters

Nine months after the discovery of the Belgian carcasses, the debate continues on the origin of a disease that spared Germany. The only certainty is that man is no stranger to it. And the eyes quickly turned to the cynegetic environment. At issue is the possible introduction of Polish wild boars for hunting, an illegal practice in Belgium, explains Lionel Delvaux, agriculture and biodiversity mission officer of the Inter-Environment Wallonia Association (IEW).

In early February, four people were taken into custody. While two were quickly released, two others remained in detention, before being released on conditions, one (a hunter) at the end of February, the other (hunter and private guard in Buzenol, in the commune of Etalle) at the end of March. The two men are suspected of having participated in the trafficking of wild boars from eastern countries, a practice prohibited in Belgium.

A not very clear feeding?

Another cynegetic practice may have led to the onset of the disease in Belgian wild boars, in this case the feeding of large game. This is indeed allowed south of the Sambre and Meuse furrow (not to the north), but only from grass hay and/or legumes.

However, some hunters used food waste illegally, some from restaurants, which may have facilitated transmission, for example via contaminated pork, Delvaux suggests. In addition, feeding, strongly criticized by associations, is suspected of promoting the density of wild boars, thus epidemic transmission.

Polish and military sandwich in gutter

Contacted by the JDLE, Benoît Petit, president of the Royal Saint-Hubert Club (the main Belgian association of hunters), believes that the possibility of an importation of infected wild boars does not hold up. At issue: a sick wild boar would not survive the time of the trip. ""The investigation is ongoing, but there is nothing at all, it is a judicial machination,"" he said.

Another avenue mentioned by the authorities, when the first two cases appeared, was that of food waste abandoned by truck drivers in Eastern Europe during a passage through Belgium, for example via an abandoned ham sandwich on a motorway.

Benoît Petit also suspects a military base in the commune of Etalle, whose soldiers went ""in operation in the spring in Latvia and Estonia"", while Czech soldiers came to train there. This assumption is not credible according to Lionel Delvaux, who acknowledges that it is ""difficult to know where the responsibilities are"".

Could this be the greatest animal epidemic of all time? Since its detection in August 2018 in China, home to nearly half of the world's pig population, African swine fever has wreaked havoc. Since then, it has spread to Vietnam, Cambodia, Mongolia and North Korea, and is expected to spread to other Asian countries, including Thailand, Laos, Burma and the Philippines. In China, some experts estimate that 200 million animals could be slaughtered, the British daily The Guardian reports.","http://www.journaldelenvironnement.net/article/peste-porcine-africaine-un-mystere-belge,97906",Red On Line (FR),Contactez-nous - Red On Line (FR),"Vous souhaitez en savoir plus sur le fonctionnement de nos solutions HSE (Hygiène, sécurité et environnement) ?

CT2QNGJE7R,ONSSA reassures about the health status of the herd,"The National Cattle Control Program continues and extends to sheep and goats.
Launch of a booster vaccination campaign for cattle.
Launch of a preventive vaccination campaign for sheep and goats.
 
As part of the monitoring of the health status of the national cattle herd, sheep and goats, recent field investigations by the Veterinary Services of the National Food Safety Office (ONSSA) have found cases of lameness in adult sheep and goats without serious health, and deaths mainly in the births of sheep and goats less than one month of age. 
The regions concerned are mainly Fez - Meknes, Oriental and Rabat - Salé - Keritra, says the ONSSA.
Following the finding of these deaths, an in-depth diagnosis was carried out by the veterinary services of the ONSSA at the national level to determine the exact causes through investigations and investigations carried out in the field. 
At the same time, extensive laboratory analyses were carried out to identify a circulation of foot-and-mouth disease in sheep and goats, whose molecular characterization showed that it was the same viral strain that affected cattle in early 2019, namely the ""O/EA-3, East Africa"" virus.
Virus against which a national control programme has been implemented, which has helped to control the disease in cattle at the national level, notably through the widespread vaccination of the cattle herd, which has nearly 3 million head, the Agency informs;
It should be noted that this disease (foot-and-mouth fever) mainly affects cattle, which can cause considerable economic damage (mortality, decreased production, ..) if adequate control measures are not taken. The disease has already been declared in 2018 by some countries in the region.
In addition, it has also been established that sheep and goats can carry the foot-and-mouth virus without showing clinical symptoms.
However, the characteristic of this new viral strain (O/EA-3), introduced from outside the country, is that it is capable of causing mortality in sheep and goat births.
This phenomenon is exacerbated by the extensive breeding method and mobility of animals as well as the coexistence of other factors, including the presence of certain diseases of rearing (colibacilloses, enterotoxics, parasitic diseases) and climatic conditions.
It is important to remember that in sheep and goat breeding, it is usually accepted to normally observe a low mortality rate due to several factors, says the ONSSA.
Thus, in the continuity of the national action programme against bovine FMD fever that has been in place since the emergence in Morocco of this new viral strain in January 2019, control actions will be extended to sheep and goats and implemented from next June, as soon as the vaccine is adapted to this new viral strain is received.
These control actions will include:
- A vaccination campaign to recall cattle against foot-and-mouth disease to strengthen herd immunity;
- A vaccination campaign, as a preventive measure, of sheep and goats against this new viral strain.
These campaigns will be carried out free of charge for the benefit of breeders by the mandated health veterinarians and the veterinary services of the ONSSA.
Breeders with abnormal mortality in young sheep and goats are also encouraged to contact the nearest ONSSA provincial veterinary service. 
It should be noted that foot-and-mouth disease is an animal-specific disease that is not transmissible to humans.

0Y2QHP09PM,Human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) in Nepal,"In Nepal, on 2 May 2019, the Division of Epidemiology and Disease Control of the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population reported the first human death from influenza avian A (H5N1) infection.
According to health officials, the victim was a 21-year-old man from Kavrepalanchok district.
The Himalayan Times reported that the person died on March 29 after contracting the flu. 
The laboratory tests, received on 30 April, tested positive for the A(H5N1) virus. Health officials who had diagnosed avian influenza as the cause of the patient's death had sent the sample to Japan for further testing.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the A(H5N1) virus is a type of influenza virus that causes severe and highly infectious respiratory illness in birds. Human cases of avian influenza with H5N1 viruses occur from time to time, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people are infected, the mortality rate is about 60%.
Almost all cases of infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds or in environments contaminated with the A(H5N1) virus. The virus does not easily infect humans and its spread appears to be unusual.
The last cases of human infection were reported in 2017 in Indonesia and Egypt. Prior to this case, since 2003, a total of 860 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection, including 454 deaths, have been reported to WHO in 16 countries.

About 15 animals are believed to have died on the Comorian island of Mohéli, in Fomboni, France Mayotte Matin reports. While the samples still need to be analyzed in the laboratory for confirmation, the animals had all the symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease. The disease is particularly contagious in cattle, pigs, sheep and goats. It is rarely fatal for adults but causes over-mortality of young people. It is not transmissible to humans, but it can become a vector.

Mayotte did not wait for the results of the tests to take precautionary and preventive measures. Pediluvians to disinfect passengers' shoes have been installed at the airport, the port of Longoni and the landing site of Petite-Terre. Health and customs controls have also been strengthened with travellers in order to enforce the ban on the importation of animal products (meat, milk and dairy products, animal skins, etc.).

If a outbreak is detected, international protocols are very clear: all livestock must be slaughtered in a way that minimizes the risk of spread. A sword of Damocles above the Mahorese breeders already well struck by Rift fever.

Threat in the Mascarene?

Mayotte is not the only island in the Indian Ocean to take all its precautions against foot-and-mouth disease. Last January, Mauritius and Rodrigues doubled controls on their livestock, reports the Express.mu. An emergency protocol that comes after the announcement of contamination of livestock on South African farms. With the two Islands of the Mascarene exporting a lot of oxen and cabris from South Africa, the Mauritian government did not want to take any risks.

No cases of foot-and-mouth disease are currently reported on the sister island, but the memory of 2016 remains strong... Three years ago, Rodrigues was hit hard by the epidemic. Nearly 3,200 animals were slaughtered while 2,118 died from the disease. In Mauritius, 1,695 animals had died. At the time, Reunion Prefecture had put in place a heightened vigilance system.

9QKDRW7CY5,"Rift Valley Fever: 2 new human cases, and 2 livestock this week","Situation update on outbreaks of human and animal cases as of April 3, 2019
Animal diseases of viral origin, Rift Valley fever mainly affects domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), causing abortions and high mortality in young animals. It can be transmitted from the sick animal to humans.
In the past week, 2 new animal outbreaks and 2 human cases have been reported, for a total of 86 animal outbreaks and 116 human cases since the first cases occurred at the end of November 2018. In this epidemic context, the prefecture of Mayotte, in collaboration with the ARS Indian Ocean and the Directorate of Food, Agriculture and The Forest of Mayotte (DAAF) recalls the importance of preventive measures to protect against the disease.
Epidemiological situation as of April 4, 2019
In total, since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November):
Veterinarians' samples from sick animals or abortions identified 86 outbreaks of sick animals (including 71 cattle outbreaks). Animal outbreaks are mainly located in the central and northwestern part of the island, but some animal outbreaks have been found in the commune of Mamoudzou.
116 human cases of RVF have been reported to the OI OI Monitoring and Emergency Platform (CVAGS) in Mayotte by the CHM laboratory.
Since the beginning of the health alert, human cases have remained mainly located in the central and northwestern parts of the island. The trend observed over the past 3 weeks to the decrease in the number of new infections is confirmed.
Recommendations
In ruminants, surveillance of Rift Valley Fever includes the monitoring of abortions. Breeders are asked to report to veterinarians immediately any abortion or stillbirth occurring in their animals or any sick animal in order to take samples in search of the disease.
A ban on the marketing of heat-treated untreated milk has been in effect since 27/02/2019.
An order banning the export of live animals, raw meat and milk, produced by mahorais ruminant farms, has been in force since 20/03/2019.
In humans, the disease usually manifests itself in influenza syndrome: high fever (39 degrees), muscle and/or joint pain, severe headache, fatigue. In the vast majority of cases, healing occurs within a few days.
It is recommended that you consult a doctor as soon as the signs appear so that samples for the disease are taken.
Recommendations to protect yourself from the disease:
For breeders and people in contact with animals:
o Wash your hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats).
o Do not handle sick or aborted animals or abortion products without protection.
o Do not handle animal carcasses without protection.
o Wear gloves, covering goggles and above all a mask for the slaughter of any animal. Infected animals may show no signs, although they can transmit the virus.
For food:
o Boil the milk
o Do not consume curd unless it has been boiled and curdled by lactic ferments.
o Wash your hands after cutting meat.
o Do not eat uncooked meat
o Do not eat the meat of a sick animal.
To protect yourself from mosquito bites:
o Eliminate larval deposits, empty any containers that may contain water.
o Use mosquito nets and repellents.

G2JNBRC0KX,The spectre of an African swine fever epidemic is making Canadian producers shudder,"According to Andrew Dickson, Executive Director of Pork Manitoba, the discovery of the PPP would be a disaster for Canadian producers.
""Our exports would stop immediately if the disease was discovered,"" he says. It would be a major disaster for our industry. »
He explains that 70% of Canadian pork and 90% of Manitoba pork are destined for export.

According to Canada's Department of Agriculture, Canada's hog industry contributes $24 billion to the country's economy and accounts for $4.5 billion in exports.
More than 8,000 farms and 100,000 workers, mostly in Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba, could be affected if the PPP arrives in Canada.
The disease was detected in Europe in July 2017 and in China in the summer of 2018.
African swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease that affects farmed and wild pigs. The virus causes high mortality rates and can infect herds. There is no treatment or vaccine.
Take the necessary precautions
Although the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is not yet concerned about the arrival of the disease in Canada, important precautions are being taken.
""Our government takes very seriously the threat that PPP poses to the health of our animals and the Canadian hog industry. While PPP poses no risk to human health, it is known to have a devastating effect on farms and those dependent on the hog industry,"" said Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Lawrence MacAulay.
In 2017, Manitoba's largest pork producer, HyLife, was hit hard by THE DEP. More than 35,000 pigs had to be slaughtered to prevent the spread. Over the past five years, nearly 100,000 animals have been slaughtered in Manitoba as a result of PED.
HyLife President Claude Vielfaure wants to prevent a similar epidemic from happening again, especially since exports would be suspended this time.
""For us, it would be a disaster. China buys a lot of our products,"" he says.
Mr. Vielfaure also said he paid particular attention to his imports, which could contaminate herds.
""We bring a lot of products imported from China and we work at the national level with the Canadian Pork Council to make sure we import products that are safe,"" he says.
The Canadian government says the disease can enter the country in a number of ways:

Travellers entering or returning to Canada who do not report meat or meat-containing products;
Travellers visiting farms in PPP-infected countries or areas and, on their return, visit farms in Canada;
Fodder and forage ingredients from infected countries;
Feeding pigs with meat or meat-containing products (kitchen scraps, pet food, etc.), an illegal practice in Canada;
Inadequate measures on the farm to prevent infection.

""The federal government is responsible for ensuring that the disease does not enter Canada,"" says Dickson, who admits, however, that producers also have a role to play.
The Department of Agriculture says a management committee on THE PPP, bringing together leaders from the federal and provincial governments as well as industry in this sector, has been set up. The committee will review measures, then adopt and implement them quickly, and coordinate efforts to respond quickly should an outbreak occur in the country.",https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1152966/peste-porcine-africaine-porc-manitoba-gouvernement-canada-inspection-aliment-protection,Radio-Canada,Le spectre d'une épidémie de peste porcine africaine fait frémir les producteurs canadiens,"Cinq ans après les premiers cas de diarrhée épidémique porcine (DEP) au Canada, la peste porcine africaine (PPA) rend les autorités nerveuses.

The number of sheep killed by the plague of small ruminants reached 3150 head on Tuesday (January 15th), said the DSV, which denied all other figures put forward by other parties and which indicate several thousand or even tens of thousands of cases.
Almost all of the animals killed by the disease are lambs less than a month old because ""they can't stand the fever caused by the disease or the heat shock they endure because of the low temperatures in the affected areas,"" according to Kaddour.
The first cases of sheep deaths were reported between September and October, according to the official of the Ministry of Agriculture.
""We immediately looked at these cases and saw symptoms that allowed us to suspect the plague of small ruminants, especially since it is a disease that exists in all Maghreb countries as well as in Africa and Asia,"" he explains.
The epidemic subsequently grew until it necessitated the closure of livestock markets and the regulation of animal movements as early as December, ""without stopping the supply of slaughterhouses because the population needs to be fed sheep meat,"" according to Kaddour.
The suspicions of the Ministry of Agriculture were confirmed by analyses carried out by the reference laboratory located in France. ""As soon as we had the diagnosis, the Prime Minister gave us his approval to purchase the vaccine under special conditions. . . . We have ordered 21 million doses and are waiting for the first quantities to be delivered by the end of January,"" the DSV said.
1400 veterinarians mobilized
El Hachemi Karim Kaddour reassures the situation on the ground and the management of reported cases and breeders, in particular thanks to the mobilization of 1,400 veterinarians in the Ministry of Agriculture.
""All veterinary services are mobilized, we give advice and, at the same time, we take a daily toll on losses,"" Kaddour reassures.
""When we are told of a health problem, our services go to the breeder to identify the pathology, because there are other pathologies than the plague. When it comes to a notifiable disease, our services are mobilized,"" says the DSV.
Among the measures taken by the ministry to contain the epidemic, the isolation of affected animals, the distribution ""to all breeders"" of disinfectant and the start, as soon as the first batches of vaccine are received, at the end of January, the vaccination campaign. ""The vaccination system is already in place and we will start with the most affected wilayas to generalize the operation later to the whole national territory,"" promises Dr El Hachemi Karim Kaddour.
""Strong suspicion"" of a sub-Saharan origin of contagion
A sub-saharan origin of the contagion of the Algerian herd by the plague of small ruminants is ""highly suspected"", according to Dr El Hachemi.
The plague of small ruminants is ""a cross-border disease and all the viruses we have isolated are from the Sahel countries,"" the official said. For him, the disease ""has gone up from south to north.""
The disease is present in North Africa but even more so in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where sheep and cattle breeds ""forbidden to move back to northern Algeria"" exist, according to the DSV.
But animals acquired in the extreme south of the country ""at a low price"" are transported north to be resold with a large profit margin. This practice is suspected to have contributed to the spread of sheep and goat plague from the south to the north of the country.
""On several occasions the security and customs services intercepted convoys of these animals and destroyed them,"" says Dr. El Hachemi, for whom ""the fraudulent importation of a single infected animal can cause the spread of the disease.""

OV77EEWD72,La peste des petits ruminants : 13 wilayas touchées,"C’est la première fois que la maladie est officiellement reconnue et déclarée en Algérie : la peste des petits ruminants a décimé des milliers d’ovins, à travers 13 wilayas du pays.
Cette maladie virale et hautement contagieuse menace le cheptel algérien. Heureusement, selon les vétérinaires, les viandes bien cuites issues des ovins atteints par cette maladie, sont propres à la consommation,car le virus de la peste des petits ruminants n’est pas dangereux pour l’homme.
L’impact est plutôt économique que sanitaire. Selon les services vétérinaires dépendant du ministère de l’Agriculture, les analyses des prélèvements effectués sur des ovins et des camelins malades, ont confirmé qu’ils sont atteints de la peste des petits ruminants. Les premiers cas de  la maladies ont été découverts, il y a deux mois, dans les wilayas de Tébessa, Béjaïa,Laghouat et Djelfa. Le ministère de l’Agriculture, du Développement rural et de la Pêche a ordonné la fermeture des marchés hebdomadaires de bétail pendant un mois, et l’interdiction du transport des ovins sans autorisation des services de l’abattoir,pour protéger le cheptel contre la propagation de la fièvre aphteuse et de la peste des petits ruminants. Les services vétérinaires entameront, en janvier prochain, une campagne de vaccination du cheptel. Le ministère de l’Agriculture a déclaré avoir « mobilisé un budget de 400millions de dinars, pour l’acquisition du vaccin contre la peste des petits ruminants ». Malgré les déclarations rassurantes des autorités, beaucoup de vétérinaires contactés par TSA, sont sceptiques. « Les chiffres déclarés ne correspondent pas à la réalité. Les autorités sanitaires des DSA minimisent la situation, et ont tendance à dire que tout va bien et que la situation est maîtrisée. Or, ce n’est pas le cas « , critique un vétérinaire qui a préféré requérir l’anonymat. Ce vétérinaire nous livre un certain nombre d’informations concernant cette maladie. « La peste des petits ruminants touche principalement les chèvres et les moutons. La maladie sévit surtout en Afrique de l’Ouest. En 2008, des foyers ont été signalés au Maroc. Quatre ans après, un foyer a été enregistré en Tunisie. Les animaux infectés excrètent le virus par les larmes, les sécrétions nasales, les expectorations et les matières fécales ». « La maladie se propage par contact étroit entre animaux, notamment par inhalation de fines gouttelettes libérées dans l’air, par la toux et les éternuements des animaux infectés. Comme le virus est excrété par les animaux avant qu’ils ne présentent les signes de la maladie, il peut se propager lors du déplacement des bêtes infectées », poursuit encore ce vétérinaire. Et d’ajouter : « La maladie peut être suspectée face à l’apparition d’une fièvre brutale, de sécrétions nasales, et d’une diarrhée chez les ovins et les caprins, les bovins n’étant pas affectés. Étant donné que la maladie peut ressembler à un grand nombre de maladies fréquentes, notamment la fièvre aphteuse,la fièvre catarrhale du mouton ou la peste bovine, la confirmation biologique est indispensable. L’identification du virus et les tests sérologiques sont effectués dans les laboratoires ». « Quand la maladie apparaît dans une zone, la mise en quarantaine, le contrôle des déplacements, l’abattage sanitaire, ainsi que le nettoyage et la désinfection, doivent être appliqués. En dehors de la vaccination et d’un traitement symptomatique visant à réduire la mortalité, aucun traitement curatif n’existe contre la maladie »,explique ce vétérinaire.
Les précisions du ministère de l’Agriculture
« L’enquête du ministère de l’Agriculture a confirmé l’existence de deux maladies virales graves du bétail, notamment la fièvre aphteuse et la Peste des petits ruminants ( PPR) », a révélé, hier, le Directeur des services vétérinaires auprès du ministère de l’Agriculture, du Développement rural et de la Pêche, Hachemi Karim Kaddour. Évoquant ce point précis, M. Kaddour explique, lors d’une conférence de presse, que les moutons qui ont trouvé la mort dans certaines wilayas du pays, étaient atteints de la fièvre aphteuse et de la PPR. Cependant, M.Kaddour assure que « l’Algérie n’est pas dans un état d’alerte » et que « la situation est maîtrisée », soulignant qu’ »on attend les résultats définitifs des laboratoires spécialisés, pour prendre toutes les dispositions et éviter le pire ».
Le même intervenant rappelle, que le ministère de l’Agriculture a pris une panoplie de mesures, pour limiter la contagion à même de fixer l’éleveur dans sa localité et éviter le déplacement du bétail. « Tous les marchés du bétail vont être être fermés auniveau national, et les déplacements du bétail vont être réglementés », a t-il détaillé.Concernant la peste bovine, il rappelle que 400 têtes ont été abattues dans un cadre sanitaire, et plus d’un million de bovins ont été vaccinés au niveau national.",https://www.algerie360.com/la-peste-des-petits-ruminants-13-wilayas-touchees/,NA,La peste des petits ruminants : 13 wilayas touchées,NA,https://www.algerie360.com/la-peste-des-petits-ruminants-13-wilayas-touchees/,article,fr_FR,NA,2018-12-31T10:25:51+00:00,NA,13,,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['reconnue', 'Béjaïa', 'des marchés', 'des autorités', 'Maroc', 'la', 'la', 'une zone', 'la', 'le', 'rappelle'],Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]",NA,Insufficient Metadata,NA,6,,"Spatial Entities---['reconnue', 'Béjaïa', 'des marchés', 'des autorités', 'Maroc', 'la', 'la', 'une zone', 'la', 'le', 'rappelle']",Temporal Entities---['2008'],"Thematic Entities--- Host(s):[],Agent(s):[]",,0.61

An organic agricultural cooperative in An Binh ward of Rach Gia city, the Mekong Delta province of Kien Giang ( Photo: VNA ) 
Hanoi ( VNA ) -- The whole agricultural sector has 
maintained relatively good growth in the first half of 2019 despite a number of 
difficulties, especially the African swine fever epidemic, which has left a 
heavy impact on domestic animal husbandry. 

The information was released by Deputy Minister 
of Agriculture and Rural Development Phung Duc Tien at a press meeting in Hanoi 
on June 17. 

He noted in the six months, the growth rate of 
agricultural production value was estimated at 2.7 -- 2.9 percent compared to 
the same period last year. That comprises the expansion of 1.68 percent in 
agriculture ( including plant and animal farming ), 4.53 percent in forestry, and 
6.5 percent in fisheries. 

The sector has worked to develop cattle, poultry 
and aquatic farming to make up for a possible pork shortage at the end of this 
year as a result of the African swine fever epidemic. 

Tien cited data of the General Statistics Office 
as showing that the number of cattle farmed nationwide has increased by 2.9 
percent while the amount of live cattle sold for meat was about 193,000 tonnes, 
up 4 percent from a year earlier, thanks to good consumption and high prices 
which have encouraged the farming. 

The number of farmed poultry has risen by 11 -- 
12 percent as there were no epidemics. Meanwhile, good growth has also been 
recorded in fisheries and it is hoped at 6.5 -- 6.7 percent in 2019. 

Highlighting the growth in overseas shipments, 
the official said the exports target of 43 billion USD for this year is high 
but still achievable, adding that the proportion of high-quality products in 
agricultural production and exports has increased. 

Total agro-forestry-fishery exports are estimated 
at 19.75 billion USD in the reviewed period, up 2.1 percent year on year.-VNA",https://en.vietnamplus.vn/agriculture-still-grows-braving-african-swine-fever-epidemic/154522.vnp,VietnamPlus,"Agriculture still grows, braving African swine fever epidemic | Business | Vietnam+ (VietnamPlus)","The whole agricultural sector has maintained relatively good growth in the first half of 2019 despite a number of difficulties, especially the African swine fever epidemic, which has left a heavy impact on domestic animal husbandry.",https://cdnimgen.vietnamplus.vn/t460/Uploaded/wbxx/2019_06_17/agricultural_sector.jpg,article,NA,NA,2019-06-17T21:27:00+07:00,"Vietnam's agricultural sector, Vietnam's agricultural growth, African swine fever, agricultural production value, agro-forestry-fishery exports, cattle farming, poultry farming, updated Vietnam news, Vietnamplus, Vietnam News Agency",14,0.875,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['An Binh', 'Mekong Delta', 'Hanoi', 'Hanoi'],Host(s):['cattle', 'poultry'],Agent(s):[]",NA,Sufficient Metadata,VietnamPlus,11,0.611111111,"Spatial Entities---['An Binh', 'Mekong Delta', 'Hanoi', 'Hanoi']","Temporal Entities---['Monday, June 17, 2019 - 21:27:00', 'the first half of 2019', 'June 17', 'the six months', 'the same period last year', 'this \nyear', 'a year earlier', '2019', 'this year']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['cattle', 'poultry'],Agent(s):[]",0.79,0.83

What is being done to stop the spread of swine flu? Imports of live pigs from countries that test positive for African Swine Fever has now been banned in reaction to the news. The movement of pigs between farms will be strictly controlled, the director of veterinary and livestock services, Xolani Dlamini, said in a statement in the Swazi Observer. Dlamini said his office would introduce a system to identify and track pigs. He said: `` Importations are only from slaughterhouses and establishments that are located in ASF-free zones and also source their slaughter stock from registered and supervised disease-free compartments. '' China has also been struggling to contain an outbreak of ASF since last year, causing major losses to the world's largest hog herd. African Swine Flu global impact. 
The impact of ASF disease has been significant. Some 114million metric tons of pork are annually produced with China accounting for almost half of the market.

Since last February, at least 2.47 million pigs have died. There is no vaccine or cure for the disease, which is not transmitted to humans. On 11 June, the outbreak reached Hồ Chi Minh City. So far, the country has lost US$ 154 million. Vietnam has the seventh largest pig population in the world ( 30 million animals ) and is the sixth producer of pork. Pork constitutes 70 per cent of the local diet. 

Hồ Chi Minh City ( Asia. 
News ) -- The African swine fever ( ASF ) pandemic has brought Vietnam's food industry to its knees and hit thousands of farming families hard. 
The first cases of the disease -- for which there is no vaccine or treatment -- were reported in early February in the northern province of Hưng Yên. So far 59 of Vietnam's 63 provinces and province-level cities have been affected and at least 2.47 million pigs have died. 
On 11 June, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Hồ Chi Minh City ( former Saigon ) announced that the outbreak had reached the city, infecting a pig farm in the outlying District 9. 
Government officials report that they culled 163 pigs at a farm owned by Ms Lê Thị Ngọc Cẩm. The authorities destroyed the food left and buried the carcasses in a deep pit, which is sterilised every day. 
`` The first case of African swine cholera in Hồ Chi Minh City is from a household that raised pigs on leftovers from food shops and small restaurants in the district, '' said Nguyễn Phước Trung, director of the Hồ Chi Minh City Department of Agriculture and Rural Development 
`` We are most worried about pigs that are imported into the city by small trade across borders without taxes ( đường tiểu ngạch ), said Ms Phạm Khánh Phong Lan, head of the Hồ Chí Minh City Management Board of Food Safety. `` This means smuggling across Vietnam's borders. '' 
What is more, `` Currently, some crooks are appearing and announcing that they sell vaccine to prevent African swine cholera, '' she added. `` But I confirm that so far experts and researchers are still studying the kind of vaccine. We hope that we will have the vaccine as soon as possible. So those who are advertising and selling the vaccine are fraudulent ''. 
Vietnam lost and an estimated 3.6 trillion dongs ( US$ 154 million ) from the outbreak so far, including the costs of culling infected pigs and spraying affected areas with disinfectants. 
The Southeast Asian nation has the seventh largest number of pigs in the world, 30 million, and is the sixth largest pork producer. Pig farming provides a livelihood to 2.4 million households, according to official figures, and pork constitutes 70 percent of the average Vietnamese diet. 
The Ministry of Industry and Trade is looking at frozen pork supplies as a plan to meet a possible pork shortage. In fact, pork imports rose 6.7 times in the first four months of this year from the same period last year to US$ 23.58 million. 
African swine fever does not affect humans.

`` Swine Fever Vaccines Swine Disease Monitoring Report, the first African swine fever ( ASF ) outbreak in Hong Kong is discussed. The first two outbreaks were detected at slaughterhouses in animals imported from mainland China and led to the culling of more than 10,500 pigs. The first ASF outbreak in North Korea was reported in May as well. Classical swine fever ( CSF ), also known as hog cholera, is a contagious viral disease of pigs, including wild boar. The causative virus is a member of the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, and is closely related to the viruses of bovine viral diarrhoea and border disease.

Swatini bans imports of live pigs from countries affected by African swine fever 
MBABANE ( Reuters ) -- The Kingdom of e. 
Swatini, formerly known as Swaziland, banned imports of live pigs on Monday from countries that test positive for African Swine Fever ( ASF ) after an outbreak of the disease in neighboring South Africa. The movement of pigs between farms will be strictly controlled, the director of veterinary and livestock services, Xolani Dlamini, said in a statement in the Swazi Observer. The disease is highly contagious and fatal among pigs and there is no vaccine against it. It does not affect humans. Dlamini said his office would introduce a system to identify and track pigs. `` Importations are only from slaughter houses and establishments that are located in ASF-free zones and also source their slaughter stock from registered and supervised disease-free compartments, '' Dlamini said. Last month South Africa's agricultural ministry said the outbreak of the disease had spread to a fourth province in the country. China has also been struggling to contain an outbreak of ASF since last year, causing major losses to the world's largest hog herd.

2N2ZHW2AXZ,New suspicious cow death at the plain of the Cafres,"Yesterday, a farmer from the plain of the Cafres once again found one of her dead cows. The cause of death is unknown. It is the 6th cow that has died since the beginning of the year 2019 on the exploitation of the Lauret family.

A new cow died at la Plaine des Cafres

Since January 2019, six cows and two calves have died on the exploitation of the Lauret family, located at Bois Court in tampon.

And for breeders, this high mortality has no explanation. Yesterday, Melusine Lauret refused to have the dead cow taken over by the squaring service without taking any samples from the brain. A prelevelent necessary to determine the cause of death.

The veterinarian visited the operation of the Lauret family. An autopsy is scheduled in the next few hours.

Suspected bovine chlamydiosis

Melusine Lauret explained that he had recently learned that his herd was suffering from bovine chlamydiosis. The anxiety is great for this dairy cow breeder. This morning, all those who visited the exploitaiton had to wear a combination and a mask, as a precaution.

Chlamydiosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus chlamydia. It can affect many animal species: sheep, goats... but also cattle and some birds "".

VDI12LZGUY,Mysterious cattle deaths affect future of biogas digester projects,"DOMBOSHAVA — The future and sustainability of the cattle dung manure-fed biogas digesters hangs in the balance following widespread deaths of cattle in Goromonzi district under mysterious circumstances.
BY TONDERAYI MATONHO
The community in Ward four is still puzzled by the situation, particularly, when the responsible ministry for livestock development, has failed to come up with an explanation.
Cornelius Chataika, the treasurer of the Domboshava Development Community Association (DDCA), said “about 90% of the cattle around the ward, died due to an unknown air borne disease and this had affected the availability of cow dung to feed the digesters”.
“The future and sustainability of the biogas digester projects in this ward and other surrounding areas is now threatened with the deaths of hundreds of cattle in 2017 with experts in the livestock ministry even failing to explain the mysterious disease,” he said.
“The situation was so severe and what we only observed during this period after the deaths were blisters around the livers of the cattle.”

This information was disclosed during a recent field visit organised by ZERO, a regional non-governmental organisation, to delegates from the civil society organisations and government ministries, the private sector and representatives from the Domboshava community.
Meanwhile, an official from the Energy and Power Development Ministry, Chido Mado, said during the field visit, “lack of constant feeding of digesters leads to the development of ‘scum’, a thick dirty foam layer on the surface of the liquid manure and this will require a complete renovation of the plant for effective biogas production”. 
“In order to counter that, it is better to provide minimal feed to the plant than completely desist from feeding”, Mado said, equating biogas digesters to the human body which requires everyday feeding for its survival.
On the issue of packaging gas into containers for sale, she noted that “this was expensive” and the best solution was to connect neighbours at village level to the bio digesters, so that one can earn some income from selling the gas.
A trust was formed after the realisation that there was no longer enough fuel wood from the remaining forests due to massive deforestation and degradation in the Mungate community, which forms part of Ward Four. There was need to look for alternative solution to the energy crisis.

To date, the trust has constructed 31 biogas digesters in this community, with 14 constructed through monthly contributions by the community. The American Embassy then donated $9 800 in 2014, to speed up construction of biogas digesters for the members of the trust.
“Of the 31 bio digesters constructed, only two are 10 cubic metres and the rest are 5 cubic metres, installed at a cost of $800 each with a 50-year guarantee,” Chataika said, adding that the five cubic metre one produces enough energy for a family of eight while having three meals a day.
Barbra Warikandwa, a bio digester beneficiary, said that her family uses cow dung, vegetable waste and chicken waste to feed their 10 cubic metre bio-digester plant.
“Even though our plant has not received feed for the past year due to the cattle deaths, it is still producing enough energy for cooking, with household costs getting lower ever since we started to use biogas for cooking,” said Warikandwa.
She also noted that as farmers, their horticulture business has boomed because the slurry from the plant is used as fertilizer for horticultural plants. Warikandwa is currently supplying horticultural produce to supermarkets such as TM, OK and Spar and was also supplier of the year in 2017 at TM/Pick and Pay at the main Borrowdale Shopping Centre.
“The project has relieved women and children of traditional chores that have tended to keep women disadvantaged and is also allowing children to attend school more often and participate in other social activities rather than looking for firewood”, she said.

Gamuchirai Chipangura, a programme officer at the Zimbabwe Women Resource Centre and Network, said there was need to seriously involve and broaden issues of women, widows and child-headed households, as this was critical in the progress of such bio digester projects as these vulnerable groups now dominate many rural communities.
“There is a lack of consideration of complete participation of vulnerable groups in many such community development projects. Many of these vulnerable groups are not well represented and are not benefitting from such projects,” she said on the sidelines of the recent field visit.
ZERO programme officer, Wellington Madumira, said: “Community involvement, local partnerships, smart solar and bio gas design with continued training, maintenance and renewable energy policy alignment are essential in meeting rural communities’ energy needs”.
The deputy director, research and technology, in the Higher and Tertiary Education ministry, Charles Musari, also noted that the food security and technology promotion equation needed to be seriously considered in such projects.
“We have a situation where cattle dump is required to be fed into bio digester plants and at the same time, the same material is required as manure in household crop fields and given this scenario the issue of sustainability of projects tends to be threatened, affecting household food security,” he observed.
The Ministry of Energy and Power Development in collaboration with SNV is working with communities in the biogas schemes for women in Mungate Village of Goromonzi District to achieve universal access to energy.
The overall work programme is expected to contribute towards the achievement of universal energy access for all by 2030 through decentralised and renewable energy options for poor rural and peri-urban communities.",https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/07/mysterious-cattle-deaths-affect-future-of-biogas-digester-projects/,NewsDay,Mysterious cattle deaths affect future of biogas digester projects,Mysterious cattle deaths affect future of biogas digester projects,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/newsday/uploads/2018/07/cattle-death-e1531157472580.jpg,website,en,NA,NA,,14,0.875,200,Accessible,"Location(s):['Goromonzi', 'Ward', 'communities', 'Mungate Village of', 'Goromonzi District'],Host(s):['cattle', 'human', 'chicken'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[Mysterious cattle deaths affect future of biogas digester projects., DOMBOSHAVA — The future and sustainability of the cattle dung manure-fed biogas digesters hangs in the balance following widespread deaths of cattle in Goromonzi district under mysterious circumstances.,

The victims developed difficulties in breathing besides swellings around their necks. Although the health officials could not immediately confirm the strange disease, the county's public health director Mutabari Inanga revealed cases of anthrax attack had been reported during Easter holidays. Mutabari was, however, quick to allay any fear saying investigations are still ongoing. `` We can not say it is an insect bite or anthrax because it has mainly affected children and a few women. No man has been affected. If we say it is anthrax, why are men not affected yet they slaughter animals? '' he posed. Anthrax is an infectious disease that is caused by bacteria and which usually affects farm animals like cows and sheep. One can be infected if he or she gets in contact with infected animals. Some of symptoms include itchy blisters, a sore on skin and swelling around the sore. Do you have an inspirational story you would like us to publish?

27LD8M027S,China successfully separates the first African swine fever virus strain-Xinhua,"China successfully separates the first African swine fever virus strain-Xinhua 
Recently, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Harbin Veterinary Research Institute published articles in international journals, said that the successful separation of China's first African swine fever virus strain. The article, published in the Nature Publishing Group's online journal New pathogens and infections, says researchers at the National African Swine Fever Laboratory of the Harbin Institute of Veterinary Medicine have systematically studied the biological characteristics of isolated strains, such as infection, pathogenicity and propagation, and established animal infection models. 
This study preliminarily expounds the genomic characteristics and evolutionary relationship of the epidemic strains of African swine fever virus in China, and provides an important scientific basis for the effective prevention and control of the epidemic of ASF ( African swine fever ) in China, and lays an important foundation for the detection technology and the development of prevention and treatment of vaccines. On December 16 last year, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Han Changfu reportedly visited the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Medicine to investigate research on the prevention and control of African swine fever. 
Han Changfu pointed out: to grasp the prevention and control of swine fever epidemic in Africa is the most serious work at present, and as a scientific research institution in the field of expertise, we should give full play to the advantages of scientific and technological talents, promote vaccine research and development as a strategic science and technology project, and strive to achieve early breakthroughs. 
Focus 1 What are the characteristics of the African swine fever virus? Structural complex low temperature resistant reporters recently interviewed the researchers involved in the separation of African swine fever virus strains, he said, the swine fever virus is a DNA virus, with a double-stranded DNA structure, `` is a very large DNA virus, the genome is large, the number of genes and complex, unlike influenza virus only more than 10 protein, The swine fever virus has nearly hundreds of proteins. More protein, which increases the difficulty of research. 
`` The African swine fever virus is slightly more sensitive to heat, but more tolerant of hypothermia, '' according to research by researchers at the Institute of Veterinary Research. Research researchers believe that the main reason why the African swine fever virus is now missing is that there is no good breeding system. Normal viruses have good cell lines to amplify, but African swine fever virus does not, need a primary cell culture. He said that the international study is not deep, there has been no pathogen in the country before, there is no basis for research, many areas are unknown. 
It is not yet conclusive why African swine fever is so powerful. 
Focus 2 What is the severe African swine fever virus? 
Inactivated vaccines are not good to use. The researchers point out that the development difficulties of different animal vaccines are not the same, and the difficulty of the African swine fever vaccine lies in the poor use of inactivated vaccines. Many viral inactivated vaccines can be used for vaccination, he explains, and many will be vaccinated with `` home seedlings ''. `` For example, if a pig has an unknown disease, grind the tissue of the sick pig and vaccinate the other pigs, just like the previous smallpox, it can be protected. '' But the outbreak of swine fever in Africa is not easy to use and will not have a protective effect. 
Linda Dixon, an expert on African swine fever at the Pilbright Institute in the UK, also said in a speech at the 2019 International Innovation Forum on vaccines that experiments with infected pigs had shown that the pig's innate immune system had failed to control the virus completely. The researchers said that the previous inactivated seedlings can play a protective role, mainly humoral immunity plays a major role, the production of comprehensive antibodies can be protected, `` We have learned from middle school students, animals have cellular immunity and humoral immunity. '' For African swine fever, humoral immunity only produces partial protection and also requires a large role in cellular immunity. Linda Dixon also points out that for African swine fever, inactivated vaccines are useless and require live vaccines. 
However, live attenuated vaccines provide the quickest way to develop vaccines and can be vaccinated against pigs and wild boars. 
Focus 3 What is the importance of separating strains? 
Research and development of vaccine essential materials The researchers explained that the isolated strains would be used as experimental materials for vaccine development, and that no strains of the virus would be able to carry out their work, including basic and applied research, all of which would require viral strains. 
At yesterday's International Innovation Forum on Vaccines, Zhao Yarong, dean of the Tripp Institute of Biological Products, also pointed out that there was no good strain and everything was empty talk. 
It is understood that after the outbreak of African swine fever in China, the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences National African swine Fever Professional laboratory in accordance with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural areas and China Academy of Agricultural Sciences party work deployment, relying on the National animal disease prevention and control of high-level biosafety laboratory, emergency organization of African swine fever 
In fact, the separation of the strain has already been completed. Last year, after the outbreak, the Agricultural and Rural ministry authorized the Institute to conduct live virus research and was the only institution capable of conducting animal experiments on the swine fever virus. After that, the study of pathogenic studies and animal cases was carried out, and a breakthrough was made two months before and after. 
Although the paper has just been issued, in fact, the submission time was in early December last year, when the experiment was completed. 
Focus 4 Where does China's African swine fever virus originate? 
It could be the same virus strain. Although how African swine fever is introduced into our country is not clear, but now the domestic spread of the outbreak is likely to originate from a virus. 
The researchers used the first African swine fever virus strain in China, using pig samples from Jiamus outbreak in Heilongjiang province on September 3 last year and inoculated with porcine primary alveolar macrophages. `` Our study found that African swine fever, which was popular last August to September, had only one virus. The African swine fever virus, which was separated from Shenyang at the time, and the virus we separated from the Heilongjiang epidemic area, had exactly the same DNA. 
`` The researchers believe that the domestic African swine fever virus is very large and likely to be a virus. Last year, a sample of pig blood powder from a feed processing enterprise in Liaoning Province was found to contaminate the African swine fever virus. 
The research of the researchers of the research researchers at the same time suggests that the standardized production process of pig blood powder can kill the polluted African swine fever virus, but pig blood powder, as a feed component, has a great risk of spreading the African swine fever virus, which should be paid great attention to. 
Focus 5 Why has n't a vaccine been developed abroad? 
The prevention and treatment of outbreaks to kill the main African swine fever has been found abroad for more than more than 100 years, why there is no effective vaccine developed? The researchers said that many of the literature shows that there are many vaccine candidates abroad, after the immunization has a protective effect, some experts feel that the protection is very good. There may be some well-protected candidate strains that have not published articles and that have been published are well protected, with just some side effects. However, after the outbreak of African swine fever abroad, mainly to take the form of culling to extinguish the virus, because the use of vaccines also have other concerns. 
If you can kill, try not to use the vaccine. 
Linda Dixon said that since the 1960s, it has been known that surviving pigs infected with the African swine fever virus are resistant to related toxic viruses, suggesting that there are great prospects for developing the African swine fever vaccine. However, the researchers said that countries generally study local strains, different strains are not the same. The work of Hatha research is mainly to reveal the biological characteristics of the popular African swine fever in China. Because the region is not the same, the popular strain genotype is different, the characteristics are different. 
Even with the same genotype, there are differences in viruses. 
Focus 6 What's going on with vaccine development? Little progress, but it could be a long way. After the separation of the strains, the main work of the Research institute was transferred to vaccine development and advanced under the deployment of the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural areas and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, the researchers said. 
At present, vaccine research has made small progress, but still in the R & amp; d Stage, the research researchers give up rest to tackle the key. 
Vaccine development may take a long process, and Linda Dixon believes the estimated time is 8 years. 
From August last year to the present, the situation of African swine fever in China is not optimistic, although it is a point-like spread, but from the national point of view, the mainland in addition to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hainan did not find outbreaks, other provinces have been notified of the relevant outbreaks. Yesterday, Du Jian, an expert at the China Animal Disease Prevention and Control center, also raised another concern at the International Innovation Forum for Vaccines: the traditional belief that African swine fever only infects pigs, but now that new research in the country has shown that the `` figure '' of African swine fever can be found in cattle and sheep, at least at the molecular level, because conditions do not exist, So no animal experiments were carried out. If African swine fever spreads across species, the dire situation of epidemic prevention will be unthinkable.

THE ministry of agriculture on Wednesday morning issued a notice warning farmers about an outbreak of the highly pathogenic Avian Influenza affecting birds in Namibia. Avian Influenza, also known as Avian flu, is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains, which occurs worldwide, although some species are more resistant than others. The ministry's acting chief veterinary officer Albertina Shilongo said that the disease was detected in penguins in the Halifax Island near! Naminus at Lüderitz in the / / Kharas region on 2 February 2019. Shilongo said over 200 penguins have been reported dead so far from an estimated population of about 7000 penguins, although no cases in domestic birds have been detected. Symptoms of the disease include swelling and purple discoloration of the head, comb and wattle, swelling and red discoloration of the feet, bleeding of internal organs and muscles, greenish diarrhoea, twisting of the neck, staggering movement and paralysis of wings and legs. Shilongo also said that wild birds play a major role in the maintenance and spread of the virus. She urged farmers to take preventative measures, including reporting any suspicion of Avian Influenza in domestic or wild birds to the nearest state veterinary office. Farmers are also urged to keep poultry away from areas frequented by wild birds and to keep away elements that may attract wild birds, including poultry feed products placed outside the building. Shilongo also adviced farmers to avoid the introduction of birds of unknown disease status into the flock, ensure appropriate disposal of manure, litter and dead poultry.",https://www.namibian.com.na/75620/read/Agriculture-ministry-on-alert-for-virus-afflicting-birds,The Namibian,Page not found - The Namibian,NA,NA,NA,en_GB,NA,NA,NA,11,0.6875,404,Not Available,"Location(s):['Namibia', 'the Halifax Island', 'Shilongo', 'Shilongo', 'Shilongo'],Host(s):['birds', 'poultry'],Agent(s):['highly pathogenic']","Outbreak:[Shilongo said over 200 penguins have been reported dead so far from an estimated population of about 7000 penguins, although no cases in domestic birds have been detected., She urged farmers to take preventative measures, including reporting any suspicion of Avian Influenza in domestic or wild birds to the nearest state veterinary office.],No. of outbreak Sentences:2",Insufficient Metadata,The Namibian,9,0.5,"Spatial Entities---['Namibia', 'the Halifax Island', 'Shilongo', 'Shilongo', 'Shilongo']","Temporal Entities---['Wednesday', '2 February 2019']","Thematic Entities--- Host(s):['birds', 'poultry'],Agent(s):['highly pathogenic']",0.72,0.67

MANALI/DHARAMSHALA: A shepherd and 116 livestock were killed after a huge mountain face collapsed in Sargha panchayat area of Nirmand subdivision in Kullu district on Monday afternoon. Police said as the region is too far from the village, they received the information late in the evening. 
Some shepherds were grazing sheep, goats and cattle near Humka village when the mountain face collapsed suddenly, said cops. As tonnes of debris and boulders came rolling down the hill side, many shepherds saved their lives by running from the spot but Bega Nand, a resident of Humka village, was buried under it. His body was later found embedded between uprooted deodar trees in the evening. 
Anni sub-divisional magistrate Chet Singh said, `` Seven persons lost their livestock in the calamity. A total of 116 livestock, including 110 sheep and goats, three cows, two bullocks and a mule were killed. Relief amount has been handed over to the deceased s family members and owners of the dead animals. '' 
Though the monsoon has weakened in Himachal, incessant rains in July and August have loosened the mountains. Most parts of the state witnessed a sunny day on Monday. Shepherds had not expected rockslide as it was not raining in the area. 
In Dharamshala, death of cattle heads in villages adjacent to Pong dam in Kangra district has spread fear among residents. People allege that about 35 heads of cattle have died in the last four days and they fear that the disease may spread among human beings. Teams of veterinary doctors have toured the area and collected blood samples of sick animals. These would be sent for testing at a laboratory in Shimla.

News. 
Spread of Anthrax Suspected in Inner Mongolia; Suspected Victims in Stable Condition14 August 2018 MONGOLIA - Eight people may have been infected with anthrax in Tongliao, the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, during a suspected outbreak in cattle, local authorities said. Nine head of cattle in Shengli village, in the city s Keerqin district, died of unknown causes, though anthrax is suspected, according to a statement released by the district government on Sunday. 
Eight people might have been infected by anthrax. They are in the hospital and in stable condition, the statement said. 
Local authorities have provided vaccinations to cattle and sterilized bodies of the cattle. The disease is under control, it said. 
Anthrax affects livestock such as cattle and sheep, as well as humans. Infection is caused mostly by contact with the skin and fur of infected animals, the statement said. The government called on the public not to panic, since the disease is preventable and curable. 
Keerqin district has imposed quarantine measures on Shengli village since Sunday. Animals prone to the disease will be banned from entering or exiting the village. Humans and vehicles entering or exiting will undergo sterilization measures. 
All animals in the village prone to the disease, including cattle and sheep, will be quarantined and put under close inspection, and will be killed and sterilized if they display typical symptoms. 
A nearby livestock trade market has also been closed until further notice, the statement said. 
Earlier, another outbreak occurred in sheep in neighboring Heilongjiang province, causing 14 people to become infected with anthrax, including one who has recovered, the province said on Friday. 
Authorities have slaughtered 818 sheep in Huanan and Yilan counties to prevent the spread of the disease, the government said, adding it s under effective control. 
Feng Shuzhang, a professor in animal infectious diseases at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, said anthrax is a deadly infectious disease among livestock, mostly cattle and sheep. It causes bleeding of their internal organs, mouth and nose and brings death within hours. 
`` Scattered outbreaks of the disease have occurred every year in parts of China, including northeastern and northwestern areas, in the past 10 years, '' he said. `` Normally such outbreaks will not develop into major pandemics. '' 
Feng said the disease infects between 300 and 500 people every year, most of them herdsmen who have close contact with the animals. There are a few deaths every year in China. 
`` The disease causes skin necrosis in areas such as the arms and back, but can be cured with proper treatment, '' he said. `` But in some remote areas infected people may not get timely diagnosis and treatment, which can result in death. 
16 suspected anthrax victims in stable condition 
Sixteen villagers suspected of being infected with anthrax in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region were in stable condition on Monday afternoon, authorities said on Tuesday. 
The anthrax outbreak - which broke out in Shengli village on 7 August - had killed 21 cattle as of 5 pm on Monday, Tongliao city s Keerqin district government told China National Radio. 
Another eight cattle died from adverse reactions to vaccinations administered after the outbreak. 
Quarantine measures have been implemented in the village to prevent the disease spreading, and 66 people who had close contact with cattle and people suspected of being infected are under observation at home, the district government said. 
Anthrax is a major animal infectious disease in China and can be transmitted to humans. Although it is deadly to livestock such as cattle and sheep, human cases are curable with antibiotic treatment. 
There were 318 human anthrax cases reported on the Chinese mainland last year, according to the National Health Commission. Three people died.

The sudden deaths of livestock has also broken the backbone of the owners who depend on it for a living. Villagers blamed veterinary officials and administration who have not conducted routine examination of the cattle resulting in the deaths. 
Cattle owners said the animals suffer from fever and later their throats get swollen and they die after a few days. Most of the dead animals were large-sized cattle, they said. Chikinia villagers informed that they have lost count of the cattle deaths. `` Around 50 cattle have died in five to seven villages of Raghunathpur block besides those in the villages of Tirtol, Kujang and Balikuda blocks. '' 
Last month, local livestock inspectors were reluctant to receive vaccines from the department because of lack of storage facilities at LI centres. Acute shortage of staff and vaccines not being administered to the cattle have lead to their deaths, the villagers said. 
The harassed villagers started treating their cattle themselves without proper diagnosis but that failed to yield result. Meanwhile, the Veterinary department has started treatment of cattle in Raghunathpur and Tirtol areas.

BISMARCK -- North Dakota's state veterinarian is reminding livestock producers to vaccinate their animals against anthrax. Dr. Susan Keller says that with the precipitation which has fallen in much of the state, conditions are right for the disease to occur. An effective anthrax vaccine is readily available, but it takes about a week for immunity to be established, and it must be administered annually to maintain protection. `` Producers should consult with their veterinarians to make sure their animals are current on their anthrax vaccination schedule, '' Keller said. `` Producers should monitor their herds and report unexplained deaths to their veterinarian early to seek a diagnosis, '' Keller said. `` Even if not anthrax, it's important to attempt to determine the cause of death to prevent other potential losses. '' Anthrax has been more frequently reported in northeast, southeast and south central North Dakota, but historically, it has been found in almost every part of the state. It is not uncommon to have a few anthrax cases reported in North Dakota almost every year. In 2005, however, more than 500 confirmed deaths from anthrax were reported with total losses estimated at more than 1,000 head. Affected animals included cattle, bison, horses, sheep, llamas and farmed deer and elk. An anthrax factsheet is available on the North Dakota Department of Agriculture website at http://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/anthrax. Anthrax is caused by the bacteria Bacillus anthracis. The bacterial spores can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions. The disease occurs most commonly following heavy rainfall, but may also occur during extremely dry conditions. Animals are exposed when they graze or consume forage or water contaminated with the spores. -- North Dakota Department of Agriculture",https://www.tsln.com/news/nd-state-vet-conditions-right-for-anthrax-in-livestock/,NA,ND State Vet: Conditions right for anthrax in livestock,BISMARCK – North Dakota’s state veterinarian is reminding livestock producers to vaccinate their animals against anthrax.

Welsh poultry flocks put on alert for return of bird flu 
Poultry farmers are being warned to be on the look-out for bird flu now that the bird migration season is underway. Wales chief vet Dr Christianne Glossop [ 1 ] stressed the importance of good biosecurity and urged poultry keepers to report any unexplained deaths or sickness. The UK was declared free of H5N8 avian influenza [ 2 ] only in mid September but already there are fears this status is being threatened. Germany recently reported a case near the border with the Netherlands, while in October Italy confirmed 17 more outbreaks: at one farm alone, more than 850,000 birds were destroyed. Current threat levels in the UK are rated medium for wild birds and low for poultry, but Dr Glossop said the return of bird flu was a `` constant risk ''. Read More 
Three cases of bird flu were identified in Wales during last winter s UK outbreak. These were all in wild birds - wigeon, buzzard and teal 
( Image: Danny Lawson/PA Wire ) 
She said: `` The wild bird migration season is well under way. This means birds will be arriving into the UK from areas where we know avian flu is present. `` I can not stress enough the importance of poultry keepers continuing to practice the very highest levels of biosecurity. `` Even when birds are housed, there remains a risk of infection and keepers of poultry and other captive birds should ensure every effort is made to prevent contact with wild birds. `` The movement of poultry should be minimised, and clothing and equipment should always be disinfected.

As well as reviewing biosecurity, owners of both small backyard flocks and large commercial premises should sign up for disease alerts and register their birds with the Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ). The latter is a legal requirement if keepers have more than 49 birds. Read More 
Public Health Wales has said the risk to public health is very low while the Food Standards Agency has stressed the disease does not pose a food safety risk for consumers.

The area in which the sick animals were found was immediately cordoned off and the infected or exposed pigs are gradually being destroyed. In parallel, specialists are disinfecting the area. 
A further outbreak of African swine fever was recorded on August 1 when infected livestock were found on a farm in Shenyang City. 
Because of the dangerous situation, the authorities decided to ban the transport of live pigs from the contaminated area to other localities in China. The export of animals outside the city was also banned. At present, representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture of China state that the situation is under control. 
African swine fever is a particularly dangerous viral disease easily spread among animals. It is not communicable to humans. The concern here is its effect on the agricultural sector, since infected livestock must be destroyed. It is possible to stop the further spread of African swine fever through strict quarantine measures.

Angola, Ethiopia, Pakistan report new polio cases. 
Two countries in Africa and Pakistan have recorded new polio cases in the past week, according to an update today from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ). Pakistan has reported two wild poliovirus type 1 ( WPV1 ) cases in Shangla and Bannu districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, with onset of paralysis on May 18 and 24. The cases raise Pakistan's total in 2019 to 24. A circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 ( cVDPV2 ) was confirmed in Angola, in a patient with acute flaccid paralysis ( AFP ) who experienced onset of paralysis on Apr 5. The case-patient lives in Lunda Norte province, which borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ). GPEI said DRC has been monitoring cVDPV2 outbreaks since 2017. An AFP patient in Somali province, Ethiopia, also tested positive for cVDPV2. The patient reported an onset of paralysis on May 20. `` Genetic sequencing confirms that the isolated virus is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak detected in the Horn of Africa in 2018, with cases reported in Somalia as well as from an environmental sample in Kenya, '' the GPEI said. Jun 20 GPEI update CDC ends investigation into 209-case E coli outbreak tied to ground beef. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) announced an end to its investigation of an Escherichia coli O103 outbreak linked to contaminated ground beef. The outbreak resulted in 209 illnesses reported in 10 states -- 13 more cases than in the agency's last update on May 13. No deaths were recorded, but 29 people were hospitalized for their infections. Two cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, were reported. `` This outbreak appears to be over. Ill people in this outbreak ate ground beef from many sources. No single supplier, distributor, or brand of ground beef was identified, '' the CDC said. On Apr 24, Grant Park Packing of Franklin Park, Illinois, recalled approximately 53,200 pounds of raw ground beef products distributed to restaurants. The day before, K2D Foods, doing business as Colorado Premium Foods in Carrolton, Georgia, recalled 113,424 pounds of ground beef. Patients reported symptom onset from Mar 1 to May 1. Of 159 people interviewed, 125 ( 79 % ) reported eating ground beef in the week prior to illness. Kentucky and Tennessee recorded the most cases, with 76 and 59 cases respectively. Georgia reported 51. Jun 19 CDC update More H5 avian flu confirmed in Namibian penguins, Taiwanese poultry. 
In the latest highly pathogenic avian flu developments with wild birds and poultry, Namibia reported three more detections in penguins and Taiwan reported three more poultry events involving H5N2, according to notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). Namibia reported its first H5N8 outbreak in February at a penguin breeding site on Halifax Island. Yesterday it reported two others that occurred in February, one on Halifax Island and the other on Ichaboe Island. The third outbreak began on Jun 20 on Mercury Island, another coastal seabird conservation area. Taken together, the outbreaks killed 238 jackass penguins. Officials said the source of the virus is migratory waterfowl. Taiwan's latest H5N2 events are part of outbreaks in poultry that have been under way since 2015. The three outbreaks began between May 27 and Jun 8. One involved discarded dead geese in Yunlin County, a second occurred in native chickens at a slaughterhouse in Taipei City, and the third involved native chickens at a farm in Yunlin County. Among the three outbreaks, the virus killed 594 of 12,505 susceptible birds.

E6WLYCOVXX,First Getah virus infection confirmed in a horse in China,"First Getah virus infection confirmed in a horse in China 
Researchers have confirmed the first case of Getah virus infection in a horse in China. 
Samples taken when the horse suddenly developed a fever confirmed the presence of the mosquito-borne virus, which was first isolated in 1955 in Malaysia. 
There is no effective antiviral treatment for horses with the infection. The 17-year-old warmblood, who lives at an equestrian center in Guangdong Province with 14 others horses, was prescribed rest. 
Its fever began to gradually subside after the fourth day and its temperature was back to normal after 12 days. 
Throughout the illness, the horse showed no nasal discharge. No depression or loss of appetite was observed. 

Tests of a blood sample collected from the animal 13 days after it got sick revealed no remaining signs of the virus. 
None of the other horses at the equestrian center got sick, and blood samples from all 14 animals tested negative for the virus. 

Gang Lu and his colleagues, writing in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology, said the presence of the virus was confirmed through molecular-based testing, which was also undertaken for other potential viral causes of the horse's illness. 
It was, they said, the first unequivocal report of Getah virus infection in a horse in China. 
The study team dubbed the strain they analyzed as GZ201808, which was very similar to a strain detected in pigs in China in 2017. 
The strain clustered in an independent branch distant from other horse-derived GETV strains identified overseas. 
They said the virus posed a potential threat to the racehorse industry in China, and urged the development of a vaccine. 
Getah virus is capable of infecting humans and many other mammals. 
Cases in horses have been reported in Japan and India. The virus has been responsible for six major outbreaks among racehorses, causing huge economic losses. 
In China, Getah virus was first identified in Hainan Province in southern China in 1964. 
The virus has since been identified in mosquitoes, pigs, foxes, and cattle, with a wide geographical distribution across the country. However, it has not been detected in horses until now. 
Considering the high detection frequency of the virus recently in mosquitoes and domestic animals in China, the study team analyzed 320 archived horse serum samples collected between 2014 and 2018. They found no evidence of the virus. 
The full study team comprised Gang Lu, Jiajun Ou, Jinzhao Ji, Zixin Ren, Xue Hu, Caiying Wang and Shoujun Li, all with the South China Agricultural University.

African swine fever ( Montgomery disease ) is a contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. The disease bears no threat to humans. The virus is transmitted by direct contact between sick and healthy animals, through pork products, and also transmitted by ticks and mechanically ( by vehicles during transportation of people and animals ). There are no vaccines against the virus. Almost all infected pigs die. The virus is destroyed by heating to extremely high temperatures.

New measures have been taken by Walloon Minister René Collin to combat African swine fever in the south of the country, while new positive wild boars have been found in Rachecourt (Aubange), L'Avenir and Le Soir reported on Friday. All traffic is prohibited in an additional 7,000 hectares of forest in the southern province of Luxembourg.
""African swine fever is not a finished story,"" the Walloon minister in charge of the case, René Collin, said at a press conference in Libramont on Thursday.
The Minister detailed a series of measures he had just taken following, among other things, the discovery of new carcasses of animals affected by the disease. ""Recently, on the side of Rachecourt (Aubange), a series of cases of viral-positive wild boars have been found. It is a new, relatively important home. This led me, on Thursday, June 27, to take a new traffic order in the forest.""
""Due to the calvings that took place this spring and to ensure maximum tranquility and prevent the spread of the virus by not disrupting wild boar populations while facilitating carcass search operations, I have decided to ban all 7,000 hectares, in an area between Virton, Aubange and Stockem, and on a second area from northern Stockem, Etalle and Tintigny,"" announced René Collin. Throughout this area, systematic carcass search operations will be carried out.
The new decree, which will be in effect from Monday 1 July until at least 14 September, only allows free movement in the forest in the triangle between Arlon-Etalle-Virton.

China reports 1st African swine fever outbreak, culls 1,000 hogs 
BEIJING: China reported its first outbreak of the deadly African swine fever ( ASF ) on Friday, as authorities in Liaoning province in the country s northeast culled almost 1,000 hogs and rushed to control the highly contagious disease. 
News of the infection will stoke concern about its spread in the world s largest pig herd, and possibly to Japan, the Korean Peninsula and other parts of Asia. Cases have been recorded across Europe, Russia and sub-Saharan Africa, but it has never occurred in East Asia until now, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ). 
Some 913 hogs were slaughtered near Shenyang, capital of Liaoning, and the outbreak had been effectively contained, the provincial animal health bureau said. 
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued an alert following the outbreak, banning farmers from transporting hogs from the affected areas and from feeding the animals with untreated food waste. 
The ministry said the infection was discovered on Wednesday on a small farm with a herd of 383 pigs in Shenbei New district in Shenyang and was confirmed on Friday. Some 47 pigs died from the disease. 
`` If it can be put under control, it should not be a problem ... but we have to watch the developments very carefully, '' said Yao Guiling, an analyst with consultancy China-America Commodity Data Analytics. 
`` If the disease gets out of control, the losses will be immeasurable. '' 
The appearance of the disease is the latest blow to Chinese hog farmers, who have been struggling with a prolonged rout as years of frenzied investment to boost production have created oversupply, with output well beyond stagnating domestic demand. 
A widespread outbreak and major culling would help remove some of the excess but it may also damage demand just as China prepares for a pick up in consumption during the week-long Midautumn holiday in October. 
ASF is one of the most devastating diseases to affect swine herds. It occurs among pigs and wild boars, transmitted by ticks and direct contact between animals. Its effects are often deadly, and there is no vaccine. 
It does not affect humans. 
China is home to about half of the global pig population, with thousands of backyard and large-scale farms operating in the northern, central and southern regions. It produces about half of the world s pork and is the top consumer of the meat. 
Smallhold farmers are less likely to have safety standards or biosecurity in place to protect against the disease. A big wild boar population can also make an area more vulnerable to infection, experts say. 
An official at South Korea s agriculture ministry said the country has not introduced any steps to increase quarantine checks or curb imports from China, but the country does not import from ASF-infected countries.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-reports-1st-african-swine-fever-outbreak-culls-1000-hogs/articleshow/65348145.cms,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Page Not Found,8,,410,Restricted,"Location(s):['China', 'China', 'India', 'China', 'China', 'Liaoning province', 'Japan', 'the Korean Peninsula', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'Russia', 'East Asia', 'Shenyang', 'Liaoning', 'Shenyang', 'China', 'China', 'South Korea', 'China'],Host(s):['pig', 'pigs', 'humans'],Agent(s):[]","Outbreak:[China reports 1st African swine fever outbreak, culls 1000 hogs - Times of India., China reports 1st African swine fever outbreak, culls 1000 hogs - Times of India

Officials with the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture ( computer translated ) have reported the first outbreak of African swine fever in the country. 
47 infected pigs were found dead in a local pig farm in Shenbei New District, Shenyang City, Liaoning Province. This is also the first reported case in East Asia.

The virus was laboratory confirmed by the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, National Research center for exotic animal diseases. 
According to the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ), another 8,000 swine from the farm were killed and disposed of. 
The local government launched the African Swine Fever Contingency Plan and Emergency Response Level II, according to the Standards & Protocols for African swine fever. A series of control measures have been taken. 
African Swine Fever ( ASF ) is a highly contagious, generalized disease of pigs caused by an Iridovirus of family Asfarviridae that exhibits varying virulence between strains and is very hardy to physical and chemical inactivation. The agent can remain viable for long periods in blood, feces and tissues. It can also multiply in its vectors. 
It most commonly appears in the acute form as a hemorrhagic fever. Subacute and chronic forms of the disease also exist. Mortality is usually close to 100 percent and pigs of all ages are affected. 
ASF is considered endemic in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It is now established beyond Africa, in the Caucasus and Eastern Europe. In the past, the virus was already detected outside Africa from the 1950s to the 1980s in Europe, the Caribbean and Brazil. The disease was effectively eradicated from outside of Africa with the exception of the Italian island of Sardinia, which remains endemic. 
ASF poses no threat to humans.

There is no antidote or vaccine, and the only known method to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass cull of the infected livestock. AFPUpdated: August 4, 2018, 7:55 AM IST Representative image: Reuters 

Beijing: China reported on Friday its first outbreak of African swine fever, the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) said, and had destroyed 336 pigs as it tried to prevent the spread of the disease. 

The notification on the OIE website said the outbreak in Shenyang, the capital of the northeastern Liaoning province, began on Wednesday and was ongoing. 

African swine fever ( ASF ) is not harmful to humans but causes haemorrhagic fever in domesticated swine and wild boar that almost always ends in death within a few days. 

There is no antidote or vaccine, and the only known method to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass cull of the infected livestock. 

The report said 47 pigs had died from the disease and another 336 exposed animals had been put down and disposed of. 

The report, made by the China Animal Disease Control Centre under the Agriculture Ministry, listed the origin of the infection as being unknown or inconclusive. 

It said an emergency plan had been launched and control measures taken, including setting up a quarantine zone and disinfection. 

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) warned in May of the risk of the spread of African swine fever from Russia. 

China is a major producer and consumer of pork. Around half of the world's pigs are raised in China, and the Chinese are the biggest consumers of pork per capita, according to the FAO.

Breaking News: African Swine Fever Found in China 
African Swine Fever has been identified for the first time in China. The announcement came on Friday, Aug. 3. 
( Farm Journal ) 
The first case of African Swine Fever ( ASF ) in China ( LINK ) was reported on Friday, August 3, reported the Swine Health Information Center ( SHIC ). The virus was reportedly first identified on August 1: The outbreak was located in the northeast part of the country, in the city Shenyang, district of Shenbei New, in the province Liaoning, SHIC said in a news release. This is a swine dense area 130 miles ( 208km ) of the North Korean border. 
`` Infection on a small farm with a herd of 383 pigs, where 47 pigs died from the disease, was confirmed by China Animal Health and Epidemiolology Center on Friday August 3, 11 a.m., local time, '' SHIC reported. 
SHIC noted that the Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention officially reports a level two outbreak, and `` it has been contained with the slaughter of a herd of close to 1,000 pigs, '' the center reported. 
`` The transport of pigs in and out of the area has been banned, along with the feeding of untreated food waste, '' SHIC stated. 
In the event of a major outbreak, the Chinese Center for Disease Control ( CCDC ) said that provincial veterinary authorities in the affected provinces will `` immediately launch a working day reporting system for the prevention and control of ASF, and suspend the transfer of live pigs and related products from the affected counties and districts. '' 
Relevant provinces are required to carry out emergency epidemiological investigation, according to the CCDC. All relevant departments are working together to prevent and control the epidemic, `` in accordance with their respective responsibilities. '' 
Thousands of miles from any known case of ASF, the introduction into China is a major concern, SHIC stated. It said the way that this disease was introduced is unknown, `` but it is indicative that this disease can travel long distances, not only in infected pigs but also by contaminated food, feed, with international travelers, and other articles. '' 
Officials noted there is major concern about ASF spreading further in the Chinese pig herd, and potentially to Japan, the Korean Peninsula and other parts of Asia. 
The current ASF challenge outside Africa started in 2007 in Georgia, from there to the Russian Federation and eastern Europe, including EU countries in the Baltic States, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic. Latvia and Romania are facing now several ASF outbreaks, and its rapid spread in wild boars and commercial herds. 
The Global Agricultural Information Network reports that pork producers and animal quarantine officials in Bulgaria are currently monitoring for African swine fever ( ASF ), as recent ASF outbreaks have occurred just over the border with Romania, and elsewhere in the region. Pork remains the most widely produced and consumed meat in Bulgaria. 
The history of ASF outbreaks in Europe highlights the factors affecting spread as well as the challenges for eradication. In regions with mainly housed commercial pig production, spread was successfully prevented in the past through strict animal movement control and implementation of culling policies, states an article in the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. In contrast, extensive pig production systems with poor biosecurity facilitate the establishment of the disease in the first place, as was seen in Portugal and southwest Spain in 1960. 
Farm Journal s PORK reported on the challenges with African Swine Fever in Europe earlier this year in this article: https://www.porkbusiness.com/article/african-swine-fever-remains-challenge-europe 
`` The People s Republic of China has more than half of the world s pig population, with thousands of backyard and large-scale farms operating in the northern, central and southern regions, and currently produces about half of the world s pork and is the top consumer of the meat, '' SHIC reports. `` If this virus is already in other herds, the challenge to contain the disease in this region will be daunting. By the time of document, this single outbreak was officially reported, and no other outbreaks have been published. '' 
No vaccines are currently available for ASF, so prevention methods, such as further surveillance, rapid response, and restriction of sales and animal movement are critical. 
`` This outbreak illustrates again that protection against this foreign animal diseases ( FAD s ) not only involves vigilance at our borders, but on each of our farms [ in the U.S. ], SHIC said in the news release. `` Restrictions of the introduction of imported foodstuffs, especially meats, and recent travelers, especially from countries battling FAD s, should be examined. '' 
ASF outbreak reported in a small pig farm in district of Shenbei New, in the province of Liaoning, Northeast China. This city is 130 miles ( 208 km ) from North Korea border, and is located at 800 miles ( 1,300 km ) from Japan ( in straight line across the water ). Also, it s 652 miles ( 1,050 km ) from Russian border and 1242 miles ( 2000 km ) from Mongolian border. Caution to the spread of the virus via international travelers and meat by-products.

China reports first African swine fever outbreak, culls 1,000 hogs 
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China reported its first outbreak of the deadly African swine fever ( ASF ) on Friday, as authorities in Liaoning province in the country s northeast culled almost 1,000 hogs and rushed to control the highly contagious disease. News of the infection will stoke concern about its spread in the world s largest pig herd, and possibly to Japan, the Korean Peninsula and other parts of Asia. Cases have been recorded across Europe, Russia and sub-Saharan Africa, but it has never occurred in East Asia until now, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ). Some 913 hogs were slaughtered near Shenyang, capital of Liaoning, and the outbreak had been effectively contained, the provincial animal health bureau said. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued an alert following the outbreak, banning farmers from transporting hogs from the affected areas and from feeding the animals with untreated food waste. The ministry said the infection was discovered on Wednesday on a small farm with a herd of 383 pigs in Shenbei New district in Shenyang and was confirmed on Friday. Some 47 pigs died from the disease. `` If it can be put under control, it should not be a problem ... but we have to watch the developments very carefully, '' said Yao Guiling, an analyst with consultancy China-America Commodity Data Analytics. `` If the disease gets out of control, the losses will be immeasurable. '' The appearance of the disease is the latest blow to Chinese hog farmers, who have been struggling with a prolonged rout as years of frenzied investment to boost production have created oversupply, with output well beyond stagnating domestic demand. A widespread outbreak and major culling would help remove some of the excess but it may also damage demand just as China prepares for a pick up in consumption during the week-long Midautumn holiday in October. ASF is one of the most devastating diseases to affect swine herds. It occurs among pigs and wild boars, transmitted by ticks and direct contact between animals. Its effects are often deadly, and there is no vaccine. It does not affect humans. China is home to about half of the global pig population, with thousands of backyard and large-scale farms operating in the northern, central and southern regions. It produces about half of the world s pork and is the top consumer of the meat. Smallhold farmers are less likely to have safety standards or biosecurity in place to protect against the disease. A big wild boar population can also make an area more vulnerable to infection, experts say. An official at South Korea s agriculture ministry said the country has not introduced any steps to increase quarantine checks or curb imports from China, but the country does not import from ASF-infected countries.

In response, authorities in the Liaoning province culled almost 1,000 hogs to control the highly-contagious disease. Cases have been recorded across Europe, Russia and sub-Saharan Africa, but it has never occurred in East Asia until now, according to the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organisation. Contain: More than 980 hogs were slaughtered after 47 died naturally from the outbreak. 
News of the infection will stoke concern about its spread in the world's largest pig herd, and possibly to Japan, the Korean Peninsula and other parts of Asia. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued an alert following the outbreak, banning farmers from transporting hogs from the affected areas and from feeding the animals with untreated food waste. The ministry said the infection was discovered on Wednesday on a small farm with a herd of 383 pigs in Shenbei New district in Shenyang and was confirmed on Friday. Some 47 pigs died from the disease. ` If it can be put under control, it should not be a problem ... but we have to watch the developments very carefully, ' said Yao Guiling, an analyst with consultancy China-America Commodity Data Analytics. ` If the disease gets out of control, the losses will be immeasurable. ` The appearance of the disease is the latest blow to Chinese hog farmers, who have been struggling with a prolonged rout as years of frenzied investment to boost production have created oversupply, with output well beyond stagnating domestic demand. Livestock: News of the infection will stoke concern about its spread in the world's largest pig herd, and possibly to Japan, the Korean Peninsula and other parts of AsiaA widespread outbreak and major culling would help remove some of the excess but it may also damage demand just as China prepares for a pick up in consumption during the week-long Midautumn holiday in October. ASF is one of the most devastating diseases to affect swine herds. It occurs among pigs and wild boars, transmitted by ticks and direct contact between animals. Its effects are often deadly, and there is no vaccine. It does not affect humans. China is home to about half of the global pig population, with thousands of backyard and large-scale farms operating in the northern, central and southern regions. It produces about half of the world's pork and is the top consumer of the meat. Smallhold farmers are less likely to have safety standards or biosecurity in place to protect against the disease. A big wild boar population can also make an area more vulnerable to infection, experts say. An official at South Korea's agriculture ministry said the country has not introduced any steps to increase quarantine checks or curb imports from China, but the country does not import from ASF-infected countries.

The highly virulent and contagious disease hit the Liaoning Province in northeast China where almost 1,000 pigs have already been culled in a bid to try and prevent further spread. 
This latest outbreak was discovered on a small farm with 383 pigs in the Shenbei New district of Shenyang on Wednesday ( 1 August ), and was confirmed today ( 3 August ) after 47 pigs had died. The remaining 336 pigs were also culled as a precaution. 
China is home to the world's largest pig herd so the industry is frantically working to ensure the disease is contained. The latest statistics state that the Chinese herd totals more than 433 million head -- over half the world's pig population which currently stands at 769 million. The European Union is home to the second largest pig herd at 150 million head, followed by the United States with 73 million. 
This is the first time ASF has hit eastern Asia but has already been found in Europe, parts of Africa and Russia. The latest outbreak in China is also a huge concern for the pig sectors in Japan and Korea. 
Once the outbreak was detected the Chinese officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs sprung into action: banning farmers from transporting pigs from the affected areas, and also banning the feeding of pigs with untreated food waste. 
As a further precaution to contain any spread of the disease, officials have now culled almost 1,000 pigs and warned farmers to be on the lookout for any signs of ASF. 
There is no vaccine for ASF which is one of the most deadly diseases to hit any pig herd. ASF is usually transmitted by ticks and direct contact between pigs. Mortality rate in pigs is high but humans are not affected by the disease.

Over 15,500 pigs to be culled after African swine fever reported in western Latvia - Xinhua 
RIGA, Aug. 2 ( Xinhua ) -- Over 15,500 pigs are to be culled on a large farm in the western Latvian district of Saldus after an outbreak of African swine fever was reported there, local media informed on Thursday. 
Media reports say it s the biggest outbreak of the disease in the country since 2014, when it for the first time hit Latvia. 
The Latvian Food and Veterinary Service has sent its specialists to the farm to take measures in order to prevent the infection from spreading outside the affected Druvas Unguri farm. 
The company which has been raising 15,570 pigs on the farm has suspended operations, the veterinary authority said. 
An epidemiological investigation is under way to establish the causes of the outbreak. 
An extraordinary cabinet meeting has been called this Friday at which the Latvian government will decide on further measures that have to be taken to curb the outbreak. 
A quarantine zone has been designated 10 km around the affected farm. Biosafety requirements and inspections will be stepped up on the farms within this territory and controls of transport vehicles increased paying special attention to the transportation of animals and meat products. 
This is the eighth outbreak of African swine fever in domestic pigs in Latvia this year. In all the previous cases the disease had affected small farmsteads. 
Representatives of the Food and Veterinary Service noted that African swine fever has continued to spread also in Latvia s wild boar population, with 666 cases recorded so far this year. 
The first wild boar killed by the disease in Latvia was found in the summer of 2014 not far from the Belarusian border.

At least 75 cows and buffaloes died mysteriously at Haryana’s National Dairy Research Institute over the past week, according to a complaint filed by an animal rights activist. Preliminary investigations indicate they were given toxic feed.
While a team from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly, landed in Karnal Monday and initiated an investigation, animal rights activist Naresh Kadyan has filed a police complaint against NDRI Director Dr R B Singh, alleging that the director and other officials buried the dead animals without conducting a post-mortem and “hushed up” the matter.
Despite repeated attempts, Dr R B Singh could not be reached for comment.
“As many as 75 cows and buffalo died due to poisonous feed and were buried without a post-mortem on the premises of NDRI. It is utter violation of procedure and has created heavy losses for the government. It began about a week ago when three buffaloes died and the NDRI claimed the deaths were a result of snake bite and buried them without post-mortem,” said Kadyan.
An IVRI team member told The Indian Express, “Our team was called by NDRI. One of their representatives had sent certain viscera and blood samples of the deceased animals. But since the deaths continued, our team came here. Further investigations are on. Prima facie it appears that the deaths were caused by toxic feed that was purchased by the institute around 10 days ago. Further investigations are on.”
Karnal Superintendent of Police Surinder Singh Bhoria said, “We have received an online complaint against the NDRI director on charges of criminal conspiracy and under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption and Cow Slaughter Acts. We have lodged a DDR (Daily Diary Report). Since it is a technical matter, we shall be taking a team of animal husbandry department officers to the spot tomorrow and initiate further course of action.”

Dr. Manny Alvarez answers if mosquitoes can be a carrier of coronavirus and transmit the illness to another personA human case of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus has been reported in a Florida county, according to health officials there. The case was reported in Hillsborough County, according to an advisory from the Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County, a local branch of the Florida Department of Health. Health officials first became aware of the case following a blood donation, Kevin Watler, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County, told local outlet WFLA. `` Anytime blood is donated, run through a lab, and there is a reportable disease that is detected in it, it is something we are made aware of at the Health Department, '' he said. WEST NILE VIRUS OVERLOOKED DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC? PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT CITES SIMILAR SYMPTOMSNo other details on the case were immediately provided.

Though side effects can be severe, most people who are infected experience little to no symptoms and fully recover.A small percentage of people infected with West Nile virus -- roughly 1 in 5 -- develop a fever and may additionally experience headaches, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, or a rash, among other side effects. Even rarer, about 1 in 150 people who are infected with the mosquito-linked ailment can develop a serious illness, such as inflammation of the spinal cord or brain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). WHAT IS WEST NILE VIRUS? The Mayo Clinic warns people who are older, as well as those with pre-existing medical conditions, are more susceptible to the virus.

MDCRG4TMDQ,New housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds against avian flu,"Bird keepers should review biosecurity and house birds.

The Chief Veterinary Officers for Scotland, England, and Wales have agreed to bring in new measures to help protect poultry and captive birds, following a number of cases of avian influenza in both wild and captive birds in the UK.
The new housing measures, which will come into force on 14 December, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.
Public health advice is that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs.
Government Chief Veterinary Officers are encouraging bird keepers to use the next 11 days to prepare for new housing measures, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their vet and where necessary put up additional housing.
These housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity regulations that were brought in as part of the Avian Influenza Protection Zone (AIPZ) on 11 November. The AIPZ means that all poultry and captive bird keepers need to take extra precautions, such as cleaning and disinfecting equipment, clothing and vehicles, limiting access to non-essential people on their sites, and workers changing clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures.
The Scottish Government has worked closely with the UK and Welsh Governments to introduce the new housing measures at the same time, meaning that the restrictions will be applied across the whole of Great Britain.
A joint statement from Great Britain’s three Chief Veterinary Officers said:
“We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease and are now planning to introduce a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.
“Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, from 14 December onwards you will be legally required to keep your birds indoors, or take appropriate steps to keep them separate from wild birds. We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.”
Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns. They can help prevent avian flu by maintaining good biosecurity on their premises, including:

housing or netting all poultry and captive birds
cleansing and disinfecting clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds – if practical, use disposable protective clothing
reducing the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and using effective vermin control
thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting housing at the end of a production cycle
keeping fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all points where people should use it, such as farm entrances and before entering poultry and captive bird housing or enclosures
minimising direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds

The new housing measures will be from 14 December onwards and will be kept under regular review as part of the government’s work to protect flocks.
Avian influenza is in no way connected to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is not carried in poultry or captive birds.
Notes to editors:
In light of evidence from the continent and ongoing high numbers of findings among wild bird populations in England, the risk of incursion of avian influenza has been increased to very high for wild birds and medium for poultry with high biosecurity and high for poultry with poor biosecurity.
