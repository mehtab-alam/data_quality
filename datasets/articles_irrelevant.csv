00298bbd1e,Archers to the rescue in Madrid as boars trespass - Yahoo News,"Archers to the rescue in Madrid as boars trespass<br />San Agustin del Guadalix (Spain) (AFP) - It\'s a scene straight out of mediaeval times set in modern-day Madrid: an archer dressed in camouflage gear, stationed in a tree at night, waiting for the kill.For five years, the authorities in the region have resorted to this unusual technique to cull wild boars encroaching on towns, relying on 55 volunteer bow hunters to eliminate pigs that take too much of a liking to urban life.\""The bow is a silent weapon and people who use it act in a silent way too, so we don\'t disturb the environment or people,\"" explains Emilio de la Cruz, a 45-year-old business owner and keen hunter who volunteers for this form of population control.The method is just one used to try and curb the proliferation of wild boar going further and further into populated areas, causing agricultural damage and road accidents.From an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 five years ago, the number of boars in Madrid has risen to around 30,000 to 40,000, environmental authorities say.- Contested method -But the method is not without its controversy, with environmentalists arguing that the animal can suffer an agonising death if the archer takes a bad shot.In some countries such as Britain, bow hunting is banned altogether.De la Cruz maintains that he and his hunting companions are all experienced, trained to shoot the arrow through the boar\'s vital organs in a quick, clean kill.Standing at a training ground in the rolling hills outside Madrid, a boar-shaped target in the background, he says the archers go out 100 to 150 times a year at the request of city or town halls in the region.In five years, they have killed 201 boars and close to 60 wild goats that have proliferated in La Pedriza, a mountain range near the Spanish capital popular with hikers and climbers.When asked to intervene, the hunters first study the zone to analyse the boars\' movements, set up shop in trees or other elevated places at night, wait -- sometimes for hours -- and take aim.They hunt in parks, golf courses or any area close to a town or city where boars have been spotted roaming free, giving the odd late-night jogger a shock.- Lack of predators -The problem of wild boars running riot in populated zones affects countries the world over, in large part due to rampant urbanisation that has gobbled up their habitat.As an example, a wild boar in Hong Kong led police on a chase last month after it wandered onto the apron of the international airport.\""They\'ve grown used to the presence of people, to eating in rubbish bins and some people even give them food,\"" says Felipe Ruza, deputy head of environmental conservation for the Madrid region.\""This causes problems because they invade gardens, cause traffic accidents and they can even attack people if there is a sow with her piglets.\""According to the Guardia Civil police force, 146 traffic accidents were caused by boars in the Madrid region in 2016, none of them fatal.Theo Oberhuber, head of nature conservation at environmental group Ecologists in Action, adds that a lack of predators such as wolves is also to blame.\""In Madrid, the wolf is now protected but it was once wiped out in the Madrid region due to the use of poison, traps,\"" he says.\""Now wolves are coming back, but there aren\'t that many.\""- The best way? -While not commonplace, resorting to archers as a population control method is not exclusive to Spain.Eric de Lavenne, head of the French Bow Hunters\' Federation, says archers have been used in several parts of France.\""The La Fleche Airport in the Sarthe (region) regularly calls on bow hunters to control the number of boars near the airport,\"" he says as an example.Another method used in Madrid is capturing boars alive in traps in areas where bow hunting cannot take place.There are no statistics indicating whether either technique is successful, but de la Cruz says he has noted a difference.\""Where at first we had to kill animals, now with our mere presence or the presence of other people, animals don\'t come anymore. That is our success,\"" he says.Oberhuber, though, is sceptical.He points to yet another technique that is being trialled in the northeastern region of Catalonia and involves putting contraceptives in boars\' food to reduce their capacity to reproduce.\""This could be an unaggressive method that doesn\'t cause death and progressively reduces the number of boars,\"" he says.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFLKKwUx8fXIU68zi06bC62fsUnTg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=FqNsWODUA8qrWbPQkvAH&url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/archers-rescue-madrid-boars-trespass-042512147.html,EN,,04/01/2017 08:06,2017-01-03 03:32:38+00:00,7b34ef8790,Yahoo News,,,,,1483417958,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
003236a5e6,More Americans Are Killed By Cows Than Sharks - Crave Online,"More Americans Are Killed By Cows Than Sharks<br />Photo: sodapix sodapix (Getty)While countless movies where sharks[1] are the enemy may lead people to believe that they are responsible for a ton of deaths, the reality is that other animals are more of a risk to Americans than sharks are. And some of these animals may surprise you.According to a new study[2], about 200 people in the United States die every year due to animal attacks as approximately $2 billion in healthcare spending are \""attributable annually to problematic animal encounters.\"" The culprit behind the majority of these attacks? Venomous attacks by insects, dog bites and farm[3] incidents. Yep, sharks aren\'t even at the top of the list.Earther[4]During the study period from from 2008-2015, there were about 86 deaths annually from venomous encounters, with the most lethal being stings and subsequent anaphylaxis from bees, wasps, and hornets. For comparison[5], the U.S. averages less than 20 shark attacks per year, and only one shark-related fatality every other year.As for nonvenomous encounters, a range of domestic and human-associated mammals including cats, horses, cows, pigs, and raccoons made up the bulk of the fatalities, most of which occurred on farms. The two largest culprits for human mortality were horse or cattle accidents. While the database doesn\'t reveal exactly how individual animal-related deaths occurred, the study states that humans can be harmed by animals through \""bites, stings, strikes, crushing, or contact.\""That\'s right, kids. Be careful when you go to that petting zoo because a horse or a cow can kick the hell out of you. Hell, even pigs get in on the action, too, according to the study.\""The risk of death due to domesticated animals such as farm animals and dogs far outweigh those due to any wild animals,\"" lead author Jared A. Forrester, of Stanford University\'s Department of Surgery, said. \""The rates of death due to wild animals remained exceedingly low.\""The study also shows that when comparing data of deaths due to animal attacks from 1999-2007 to today\'s numbers, there was no decrease. So yes, we\'re pissing animals off and they are fighting back.

003470f33c,Stray cats blamed for monk seal death in Hawaii - Newsday,"Hawaiian monk seal deaths blamed on stray cats<br />HONOLULU - Two wildlife issues have collided in Hawaii, pitting one group of animal defenders against another in an impassioned debate. The point of contention? Deadly cat poop and the feral felines that produce it.<br />Federal researchers believe feces from the legions of feral cats roaming Hawaii is spreading a disease that is killing Hawaiian monk seals, some of the world\'s most endangered marine mammals. Some conservationists advocate euthanizing those cats that no one wants, and that\'s got cat lovers up in arms.<br />Most popular Nation stories<br />\""It\'s a very difficult, emotional issue,\"" said state Sen. Mike Gabbard, chairman of a committee that earlier this year heard and then abandoned a proposal to ban the feeding of feral cats on state land after an outcry. \""It struck a nerve in our community.\""<br />The problem stems from a parasite common in cats that can cause toxoplasmosis, a disease that killed at least five female Hawaiian monk seals and three males since 2001, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.<br />\""While eight seals may not sound like a lot of animals, it actually has pretty large ramifications for an endangered population where there\'s only about 1,300 seals in existence at this point in time,\"" said Michelle Barbieri, veterinary medical officer for NOAA\'s Hawaiian monk seal research program.<br />Scientists believe monk seals become exposed to toxoplasmosis by ingesting contaminated water or prey.<br />Felines are the only animals that can shed Toxoplasma gondii eggs, or oocysts. The parasites enter their digestive tract through infected prey then multiply in the small intestine and produce the eggs. Outdoor cats excrete the eggs in their feces, which researchers say washes into the ocean.<br />The eggs accumulate in invertebrates that live along the sea floor, where monk seals often feed. They can survive in fresh water, saltwater and soil for up to two years.<br />Any warm-blooded animal can become infected. California sea otters have died from toxoplasmosis, and it\'s one of the major reasons the Hawaiian crow, alala, is extinct in the wild. Toxoplasmosis is rarely problematic for people with healthy immune systems, but it\'s why doctors advise pregnant women not to handle kitty litter.<br />Many cities struggle with feral cats, but the problem is particularly acute in Hawaii because of its sensitive ecosystem and at-risk native species, experts say. Only two mammals are native to Hawaii: the hoary bat and the Hawaiian monk seal.<br />\""Everything else here- deer, sheep, goats, cats, mongoose - they\'re all invasive, they\'re all introduced,\"" said Angela Amlin, NOAA\'s acting Hawaiian monk seal recovery coordinator, adding cats have no predators in Hawaii to control their population.<br />Marketing research commissioned by the Hawaiian Humane Society in 2015 estimated some 300,000 feral cats roam Oahu alone.<br />Marine debris, climate change, predation and human interaction all threaten the survival of Hawaiian monk seals. But feral cats present their greatest disease concern, Amlin said.<br />\""As conservationists, what we really have to look at is this is what Hawaii\'s native ecosystem includes, and cats are unfortunately not part of that,\"" Amlin said. \""When it comes to the feral cat population, there should be a program in place to bring in these animals, adopt the ones that are adoptable and humanely euthanize those that are not.\""<br />Others take offense to that notion.<br />Classifying animals with labels such as native and invasive creates a \""hierarchy in which the protection of certain animals comes at the suffering of others,\"" Hawaiian Humane Society President and CEO Pamela Burns wrote in a letter opposing the state Senate bill that would have banned cat-feeding on state land. She contended the 300,000 figure overstates the problem because the study looked at how many cats people were feeding and might have missed instances where multiple people fed the same outdoor cat.<br />Those who care for stray cats advocate trapping, neutering and spaying to help control their population.<br />The University of Hawaii\'s Manoa campus, in Honolulu, started a feral cat management program - with authorized feeders trained in tasks like trapping and feces disposal - after the stench and mess from hundreds of cats prompted complaints, especially when children at a campus daycare center got flea bites, said Roxanne Adams, director of buildings and grounds.<br />The program started in 2011 and appears to have reduced the number of felines, she said.<br />Euthanizing cats is unacceptable unless they\'re extremely sick, said Alicia Maluafiti, board president of animal welfare group Poi Dogs and Popoki.<br />\""I totally disagree with the ... generalization that cat people love cats more than these endangered species,\"" Maluafiti said. \""What we just don\'t advocate is the wholesale killing, the extermination, of one species ... for one.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEKRc7sMHHv0J9W03lOgrJlR1XhEQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779244313340&ei=UmcIWMjwJo-uzAaqmo2YBg&url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/hawaiian-monk-seal-deaths-blamed-on-stray-cats-1.12464034,EN,,20/10/2016 07:13,2016-10-17 08:40:29+00:00,7903d30a98,Newsday,,,,,1476700829,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just in time for the weekend. Great.<br />Commuter alert: The Silver Line SL-2 bus, which travels between South Station and the Boston Design Center near the Black Falcon Cruise Terminal, is being detoured starting today and won\'t stop at 88 Black Falcon Ave. Everybody who works around there will have to hoof it to and from the corner of Black Falcon and Dry Dock. Funky addresses.<br />Advertisement[2]<br />While you were sleeping: The Washington Post reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice last year[3], despite telling the Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearing -- both verbally and in writing -- that he did not.Sessions\' spokeswoman said that even though Sessions was part of the Trump campaign at the time, the meetings were in his capacity as a member of the Armed Services Committee. But other committee members didn\'t meet with Kislyak, probably because the FBI was investigating Russia\'s attempt to tamper with the election. Plus, as CNN reports, Kislyak is considered Russia\'s top spy in Washington, and is its top spy recruiter.<br />Get Fast Forward in your inbox:<br />Forget yesterday\'s news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.<br />Let\'s see who comes out today and calls for Sessions to recuse himself from the various Russia probes now going on -- predictably, Nancy Pelosi and Elijah Cummings have already called for him to resign. Sessions issued a statement saying he \""never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.\"" The White House said the report is a politically motivated attack by Democrats because Trump\'s speech before Congress got good reviews.<br />Hey, sport: The Bruins (33-24-6) host the Rangers (40-21-2) at the Garden (7 p.m., NBCSN, NESN, and 98.5 FM).The Celtics are off; last night they stunned the first-place Cavaliers[4], 103-99.<br />Advertisement[5]<br />The Sox play the Rays in Fort Myers at 1:05 p.m. (WEEI radio).<br />Not sure if Trump will sign his revised travel ban today; he and his aides delayed it so they could bask in the favorable reviews of his speech to Congress, because adulation is apparently more important. So much for immediately stanching the flow of all of those bad people \""pouring\"" into the country, as Trump tweeted Feb. 5[6]. Alas, with the WaPo bombshell about Sessions, they still don\'t have a clear news day for the signing. Governing is hard! Health care is complicated! But boy, the meatloaf is delicious!<br />The president is scheduled to travel to Norfolk, Virginia, today. He\'ll give a speech on board the USS Gerald R. Ford, then hold a roundtable discussion with military officials, shipbuilders, and community leaders.<br />Ben Carson could be approved as secretary of Housing and Urban Development as soon as this morning, and he\'ll be able to begin drawing on his extensive experience of having lived in houses.<br />Casino border wars: The state gambling commission meets today to get updates on the Wynn Boston and MGM-Springfield casinos. Wonder if they\'ll discuss the news that the tribal operators of Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut have chosen East Windsor as the place they want to build a third casino[7] -- just 16 miles from Springfield. MGM is apoplectic that Connecticut is allowing a casino so close to the Mass. border; the tribes worry that the MGM casino will cause Mass. gamblers to abandon Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun.<br />If you\'re into watching lycra-clad bodies sweat on a stationary bike -- aka spinning -- then head to the plaza of One International Place anytime today to watch more than 300 people (at various times during the day) pedal their brains out to raise money for HomeStart[8], a Boston organization that raises money for homeless people. The effort, called iCycle, is trying to raise $150,000. Here\'s the pledge page[9].<br />Eversource is before the DPU today to make the argument why it should be allowed to raise electric rates by 7 percent in eastern Mass. and 10 percent in western Mass. (Why gouge the poor hillbillies? Just kidding, western Mass. friends ...) AG Maura Healey has vowed to fight the hikes[10].<br />It\'s \""Read Across America\"" Day, and several state political types are visiting schools to read stories to students. Massachusetts native Dr. Seuss gets the nod in a couple of instances: Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan reads \""Daisy-Head Mayzie\"" to students at the Webster School in Everett, and first lady Lauren Baker also reads Dr. Seuss at the Wyman Elementary School in Burlington. Elsewhere, Education Secretary Jim Peyser reads Martin Luther King\'s \""Letter from a Birmingham Jail\"" at the Hill Elementary School in Revere, and Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack reads \""The Little Engine That Could\"" -- how fitting -- at the Transportation Children\'s Center.<br />The photo app Snapchat has its IPO today, trading on the NYSE[11] as SNAP for the first time at $17 a share. That\'s a market value of about $20 billion, making it one of the biggest market debuts.<br />Will you need visas to visit Paris and London and Rome? Residents of Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, and Romania are annoyed that they still need visas to enter the US, even though they\'ve been members of the European Union -- which is part of the US visa waiver program -- for a decade or more. So in a case of tit-for-tat, the EU votes today on whether to reimpose visa requirements on US citizens. C\'mon! Who do they think we are -- Syrian refugees?<br />How to help women access safe abortions is the topic of a discussion among representatives from more than 50 countries holding a \""She Decides[12]\"" meeting in Brussels today. Ever since Trump reinstated the global gag rule, which cut off US funding for international nonprofits that have the audacity to even talk to women about abortion, supporters have been trying to figure out how to harness government and the private sector to keep access to abortion available.<br />A few of you reminded me of a couple of other beloved pigs from pop culture who I should have mentioned yesterday in the section on National Pig Day: Andrea Frank asked, \""What about Babe?\"" -- the talking pig who learns how to herd sheep. (Here\'s a clip from the movie[13], but spoiler alert: It\'s the last scene, so if you haven\'t seen it, don\'t watch. Rent the movie instead. It\'s terrific.) \""That\'ll do, Pig.

I am not as much of a sugar addict as in the past, but it remains a sacrifice -- especially if I do not \""cheat\"" on Sundays (even though I know it is not technically cheating because Sundays do not count in the 40 days of Lent -- an odd concept in my mind). I hope to make time to volunteer in service more than usual -- that is my real Lenten goal.<br />MaryAnne Miller: I am giving up Facebook for Lent. Time to cleanse...<br />Patricia Kelley: For Lent, I told my husband I would try to say one nice thing about Trump and/or his administration. Forty days, God help me.<br />Sharona Nelson who is sad she lives in a red state now: I\'m giving up fake news.

00646bb1fd,Compassion in World Farming attacks parmesan farm welfare - The Grocer,"Compassion in World Farming attacks parmesan farm welfare<br />Animal welfare charity Compassion in World Farming has launched a campaign to highlight poor welfare standards on Italian dairy farms that supply milk for Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses.Covert filming at nine farms in the Po Valley region showed emaciated animals with sores on their legs, struggling to walk and living in cramped and dirty conditions. CIWF also said that dairy cows in the Po Valley region were habitually kept in sheds year round.The charity has launched the campaign, dubbed Not On My Pasta, to increase consumer awareness and encourage them to shun the cheeses in favour of brands with guaranteed welfare standards or vegetarian and vegan alternatives. CIWF said it hoped to urge farmers to guarantee dairy cows a minimum of 100 days at pasture per year as a result of the campaign, but it told The Grocer it did not currently plan to \'name and shame\' individual farms in the hope the sector would engage with the campaign.  \""Almost all Parmesan and Grana Padano cheese comes from zero-grazed cows,\"" said the campaign group. \""Even the EU Organic certification does not ensure pasture access and the vast majority of Parmesans and Grana Padanos in British supermarkets come from zero-graze farms.\""CIWF director of campaigns Emma Slawinski added: \""Extremely underweight, overworked animals are being treated like milk machines - some with signs of lameness and injury. \""Parmesan and Grana Padano cheeses are marketed as \'high quality\' when the reality for the cows couldn\'t be further from the truth.\""Farmers producing milk for Parmesan and Grana Padano have to follow rules set out by a document called a \'disciplinare\'. In the Grana Padano consortium\'s disciplinare, there is no mention of animal welfare. It had not responded to The Grocer at the time of publication.The Parmigiano Reggiano consortium did react to the exposé, however, and said all its farms complied with EU regulations. It added that although animal welfare did not fall under its remit, it was \""particularly sensitive to the issue of quality of life for cows\"".\""The consortium is engaged in a project to implement an animal welfare certification system,\"" said a Parmigiano Reggiano spokesman. \""We have started working with CReNBA (Centro di Referenza Nazionale per il Benessere Animale) to map the welfare of the chain, with the help of vets, then to implement a genuine animal welfare certification system.\""It told The Grocer that its certification system would be modelled on guidelines set out by CReNBA, which quote European Food Safety Authority recommendations that \""dairy cattle should not be caused to stand or walk for prolonged periods on concrete floors or floors that are wet or covered in slurry\"".",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFQSNk9SjW-YjTLGQQPJZ47Jggl8g&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779693313567&ei=uxcdWtiVC4XwzAaFio-ACQ&url=https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/buying-and-supplying/categories/dairy/compassion-in-world-farming-attacks-parmesan-farm-welfare/560589.article,EN,,28/11/2017 08:00,2017-11-27 14:00:12+00:00,09f6823154,The Grocer,,,,,1511794812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disgraced Televangelist Jim Bakker and the Profitable Apocalypse 
BILL BERKOWITZ FOR BUZZFLASH AT TRUTHOUT 
( Photo: Steven Guzzardi ) [ 1 ] Jim Bakker has always been a huckster. These days, Bakker, the disgraced PTL ( Praise the Lord ) Club televangelist who fleeced and defrauded his audience out of more than $ 150 millions, got involved in some juicy sex scandals, and served time in prison, has set up an apocalyptic shop in Blue Eye, Missouri. Located in Stone County, about 30 miles southwest of Branson, Missouri, Blue Eye, according to the 2010 census, had 167 people -- 75 households and 48 families. It is in Blue Eye that Bakker is staging his televangelical and entrepreneurial resurrection, at a 700-acre property called Morningside, which is an intentional Christian community. 
`` A time of trouble is upon us, '' Bakker -- a huge supporter of President Donald Trump -- warned his audience during one episode of The Jim Bakker Show. 
Whether it s the Wan na. 
Cry ransomware attack; ISIS; terrorist attacks in the homeland; or devastating flooding in Texas, Bakker and his wife Lori, claim to have the right goods: '' Staying Alive food - buckets full of freeze-dried products apparently capable of sustaining survivors through the Apocalypse, '' the Daily Mail s Annette Witheridge, who bought a bucket, sampled some of the food, and found it unappetizing but edible, recently reported [ 2 ]. 
In mid-May, Buzz. 
Feed s Kelsey Mc. 
Kinney reported [ 3 ] that the buckets are `` the kind ... that might be used to feed slop to pigs on a farm, and inside each are 18 dishes in freeze-dried food packets, making up almost 50,000 calories that, according to the purple labels slapped on their sides, have a 25-year shelf life. '' 
Add a little water, sit back, and survive the apocalypse. 
The Daily Mail s Witheridge pointed out that John Wigger s new book, PTL: The Rise and Fall of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker s Evangelical Empire, exposes Bakker as `` one of the biggest criminals of the late twentieth century. '' 

Wigger writes that Jim, and his first wife, Tammy Faye, went on some `` extraordinary spending sprees - $ 24,500 on furs and $ 27,500 on jewelry on one single Manhattan shopping trip and $ 170,000 on three antique cars in one day. '' 

Bakker and Tammy Faye -- famous for her ornate and often gaudy eye makeup -- were the cat s pajamas in the Christian evangelical community in the 1970s and 1980s. By the middle of the 1980s, Buzz. 
Feed s Mc. 
Kinney pointed out, `` The PTL Club reached 5.7 million monthly viewers [ 4 ], according to a 1985 study commissioned by the Christian Broadcasting Network. In 1986, proceeds for the ministry [ 5 ] came to $ 129 million, and by 1987, PTL employed almost 3,000 people and had an annual budget of well over $ 150 million. '' 
Everything the couple touched turned to gold. The PTL Club, aired on the PTL Television Network founded by Bakker in 1974, was like the Las Vegas of televangelical projects. Celebrities like Billy Graham, Oral Roberts, Mickey Rooney and Mr. T., showed up for conversation on Bakker s set, and his supporters flocked to his Heritage USA theme park. 
The scandals that brought Bakker down were both financial and sexual. 
`` Bakker was ... indicted for fraud in 1988: eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit fraud. In 1989, he was found guilty on all 24 counts and was sentenced to 45 years in federal prison, '' Mc. 
Kinney reported. Bakker did not serve anywhere near 45 years; getting out of prison after only five years, due to several judicial sentencing reductions and good behavior while in prison. 
Then there were accusations of rape `` by a woman named Jessica Hahn who ... in 1987 ... accused Bakker and another man of raping her when she was 20 years old. '' 
`` Hahn, '' Mc. 
Kinney reported, `` who has said in many interviews that she idolized the Bakker family, said she met with Bakker in a hotel room in Florida in 1980, believing that she was there to watch his children. There, she claimed, she was drugged by Bakker s accomplice and then raped by both men separately. Hahn kept quiet for seven years before the Charlotte Observer broke her story. Bakker later claimed that though he did have sex with Hahn, and that his company cut her a $ 265,000 check to pay for her silence, he did not rape her. Criminal charges were never filed, but once it became clear that his secret was going to be revealed through the Observer story, Bakker stepped down as the head of PTL. And the Assemblies of God ministry, which Bakker was a part of, immediately expelled him. Bakker s fall quickly became one of the most epic scandals in American evangelical history. '' 
While Bakker was in prison, Tammy Faye divorced him and married their close friend Roe Messner. Tammy Faye died of cancer in 2007. `` She has been replaced by lookalike blonde Lori, 18 years Bakker s junior, who he married after a whirlwind 50-day romance, '' the Daily Mail s Witheridge noted. `` Lori, 59, admits to a drug-using, promiscuous past - according to the couple s website she had five abortions by the age of 22 and then endured an abusive marriage before finding salvation and meeting Bakker in 1998. '' 
After returning to television, Bakker joined with most of his conservative Christian evangelical brethren in becoming an outspoken critic of President Barack Obama, going so far as to claim that Obama `` sounded like the representative for Antichrist. '' 
These days, there are fewer networks carrying his show, and there s an admittedly smaller, but nevertheless loyal audience. During the 2016 election he called Hillary Clinton the `` bride of Satan, '' for her support of gay rights and abortion. `` If America elects her, it could lead to Armageddon, '' he said. Ironically, her election would have been a mega-boost for his business. 
A lifelong Republican, Bakker went all in for Trump. `` I m not supposed to tell you this, '' Bakker said on his show last September. `` But I have eyewitnesses. Donald Trump is a very tender man, and he weeps. He wants to please God more than anything else. He wants to be president of the United States and make things right in this country because he loves God almighty. God has called, I believe, Donald Trump. '' 
After the election, Bakker boasted that he thought he helped Trump. After all, he said during a broadcast in December, `` Trump thinks I did, because he called and thanked me. '' 
Bakker also made a point of condemning the Women s March on Washington as being a gathering of `` demon-possessed people. '' 
Freeze dried food is not the only thing marketed at the Morningside General Store: There s camo gear, folding chairs, 36-inch snow shovels that collapse into small boxes, giant rolls of duct tape, a folding BBQ, industrial-grade flashlights, packages of batteries, i. 
Phone backup chargers, hammers, and multi-tool pocketknives. 
Back in the studio, Bakker and his guests discuss the End Days, assuring his fans that the rapture may be just around the corner. But, if it s not the apocalypse, Bakker s freeze dried food and other equipment could help people prepare for hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural or man-made disasters. 
Despite Trump s victory, Bakker continues churning up the fear. `` People have stopped storing food, and I m concerned about it, '' Bakker says. `` People feel like because Trump was elected, good times are here again. But I ll tell you what: America is fighting like never before. There are thousands of people who would kill our president if they could ... that s how evil the world is. Something big is going to happen soon.

a311d671b9,"Forum, July 29: The Miserable Life of Dairy Cows - Valley News","The Miserable Life of Dairy Cows<br />The Miserable Life of Dairy Cows In response to the July 22 column \""I\'m Proud to Be a Dairy Farmer,\"" by Paul Knox, I am disgusted by the representations made by Mr. Knox about his chosen profession. Dairy farming is a profit-driven business that enslaves cows to a miserable lifetime of forced pregnancy, stolen babies and death. Dairy cows carry their babies for nine long months. Just like humans. Their calves are stolen from them and kept alive until they are destroyed for veal and cheap meat.Mr. Knox certainly has a gift for spin when he describes how his profession works, along with his stated passion for animal welfare. For the folks who firmly refuse to rethink their food choices, his storytelling is comforting and reaffirming to many. For the rest of us, it is a disturbing spin on a tale of animal cruelty and death.Thank you, Meg Hurley, for your letter on July 19, \""Food Made From Slavery and Rape.\"" You paint a powerful picture of the realities of modern dairy farming and give us real food for thought that deserves attention. Mr. Knox attempts to discredit your knowledge of the industry with his assertion that you know \""very little about modern dairy farming.\"" Truth seekers know better than to buy into Mr. Knox\'s spin and tales concerning dairy farming. We know that dairy farming equals animal cruelty and death of innocents.Dawn Bradshaw Bellows Falls, Vt. Trump Has Done His DamageUnfortunately, those promoting getting rid of Donald Trump as president seem not to fully understand how his actions have spread like a cancer throughout our political system. It is going to take more than a change of administration to repair the damage he has done. He has fired, I believe, 46 U.S. Attorneys, replacing at my last count only one. He has replaced all important agency heads with individuals who are counter to the purpose of those agencies. He has employed unscrupulous and inexperienced individuals and assigned them tasks well above their abilities. He has restructured the ethics office to try to relax its regulations. He considers himself above the law. More importantly, he is backed by a vice president who has nothing better to offer. Mike Pence, who, as governor, championed Medicaid for his constituents in Indiana under the auspices of Obamacare, is now a turncoat by endorsing Republican efforts to dismantle Medicaid. He, too, appears to have extreme viewpoints on such issues as racism, sexism and abortion. It is from the frying pan into the fire.It is beyond my comprehension to understand why the GOP is defending and promoting these government heads who are trying to bring so much chaos and harm to the American people as a whole, while satisfying those seeking tax cuts and special treatment. What has happened to patriotism? We need to fight back in any non-violent way we can.This country has never been more in danger of collapse and regression than it is right now. We are at our weakest and open to security threats or worse, war. That\'s not the chicken calling \""the sky is falling.\"" Too late for that. The sky has fallen.Sylvia Heath Hartland Four Corners A Little Library in GranthamIt is with great excitement that I write to share that Grantham is now part of the Little Free Library movement. Our Little Free Library #55321 at Rum Brook Plaza at 249 Route 10 North is officially open for business. This effort represents the work of many people. including the Dunbar Little Free Library Committee, chaired by Beverly Marshall; Rum Brook Plaza owner Sara Hastings; woodworker extraordinaire John Larrabee; his capable school-aged volunteers from the Youth Conservation Corps; and the Eastman Charitable Foundation. As Sen. Maggie Hassan wrote, \""Their extraordinary efforts exemplify the all hands on deck spirit of New Hampshire\'s people, where we roll up our sleeves, pitch in and together move our state forward.\"" We invite everyone to stop by and \""take a book and/or leave a book.\"" Sara Lang GranthamThe writer is chair of the library\'s board of trustees. Hassan to Palestinians: Don\'t ResistRegarding the July 21 story, \""Sen. Hassan Criticized for Co-Sponsoring Israel Anti-Boycott Act\"": One of the most common refrains from supporters of apartheid and ethnic cleansing in Israel is to urge the Palestinian people to resist occupation nonviolently. They ask, where is the Palestinian Gandhi, MLK or Mandela? Setting aside the fact that the people making this argument are hardly ever committed pacifists themselves (no one ever seems to inquire about an Israeli Mandela, for instance), occupied peoples are under no requirement under international law to resist nonviolently. Still, when Palestinians and their supporters do practice nonviolent resistance, seen most prominently at the moment in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, they are told that this too is wrong.It is clear that when people say Palestinians should resist nonviolently, what they all too often really mean is that Palestinians should not resist at all, that they should completely surrender to their tormentors. Worse, supporters of BDS are increasingly facing efforts to criminalize their activities, as evidenced by the legislation now being championed in Congress by Sen. Hassan. At a time when the people of Gaza face humanitarian catastrophe as a result of the siege imposed by Israel and Palestinians protesting in East Jerusalem are being shot and tear-gassed, for Sen. Hassan to sponsor a bill that would impose prison sentences of up to 20 years on those bravely fighting for freedom is monstrous. She instead encourages Palestinians to continue participating in sham negotiations that have only facilitated further tyranny and dispossession by Israel, aided by the United States. Her position is tantamount to demanding that Palestinians die quietly.Kevin Wagner Bradford, Vt.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEP6MZv2zs2hZS-JekGDKWANCyEEw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=BoR9WbixIc-2zAbdurngAg&url=http://www.vnews.com/forumsaturday-vn-072917-11545314,EN,,30/07/2017 07:00,2017-07-29 08:00:21+00:00,32e31fcbad,Valley News,,,,,1501322421,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a3144c15f1,The dangers of untreated tuberculosis - Business Mirror,"The dangers of untreated tuberculosis<br />THE dangers of ignoring tuberculosis and maintaining it untreatable are surely complications. Just like in the variation of diseases, poor adhesion or interruption in the treatment process will confer rise to complications-often viewed as the foremost grounds of death or morbidity among TB patients.<br />Tuberculosis (TB) is mainly an airborne lung disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, spreading through droplet nuclei produced by patients with infectious tuberculosis.<br />The disease influenced by the bacteria is called Primary TB. However, dormant bacilli or the inactive bacteria may continue for years before reactivation to turn out into secondary or Postprimary TB. Following infection, the bacilli may propagate and inhabit any part of the body and stay dormant or inactive for months or years. Once the person\'s body immunity decreases, he can come down with infection in any part of the body.<br />Consequently, the nonresponsive to the need of addressing these infections results into unprecedented complications. Hence, Mbata GC and Iroezindu MO wrote a research paper regarding the complications of tuberculosis if maintained untreated.<br />_ Haemoptysis. Haemoptysis simply means coughing out blood, either in blood streak or massive. Death toll cause by this happens in about 5.3 percent of patients with massive haemoptysis. Massive haemoptysis entails coughing 100 to 600 ml in 24 hours. This complication can be obtained from erosion of blood vessel in the TB cavity, rupture of dilated blood vessel-Rasmussen\'s aneurysm and aspergilloma formation in an old TB cavity.<br />_ Pleural effusion. This complication can be mild, moderate, or massive. Mild effusion is asymptomatic, meaning showing no symptoms of the disease, while moderate to massive effusion may produce symptoms depending on the rate of fluid accumulation. Medical studies found out these probable symptoms as trachea deviation, stony dullness, straw-colored or hemorrhagic aspirate. Acid-fast bacilli are seen in 10 percent to 25 percent, pleural fluid culture is positive in 25 percent to 75 percent of cases.<br />_ Tuberculosis pericarditis. Tuberculosis pericarditis cases rates fatalities as high as 40 percent in some series. This may also be subacute although acute type with dyspnoea, fever, dull retrosternal pain and pericardial friction rub is possible. This complication may perhaps build up producing cardiac symptoms-cardiac tamponade. This problem is most widespread on elderly and HIV-infected patients.<br />_ Pneumothorax. Impulsive pneumothorax may transpire due to rupture of subpleural bulla. This type is also asymptomatic or unexpected inception of dyspnoea plus pleuritic chest pain. Tension pneumothorax may also grow.<br />_ Cor Pulmonale/COPD. Patients with venerable tuberculosis can develop a cor pulmonale. Symptoms are regularly escalating breathing difficulty, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and pedal oedema. It might also explain features of right ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.<br />_ Dysphagia/dysphonia. This is due to complications of TB of the upper airways. It is constantly because of advanced cavitary lesions and is typically seen in advanced PTB. Ulceration may be seen on laryngoscopy. Sputum stain for acid-past bacilli is usually positive.<br />_ Tuberculoma. Tuberculosis meningitis may present as space occupying lesion-tuberculoma. These complication symptoms may include persistent headache, seizures and focal ischaemiea because of the participation of cerebral arteries.<br />_ Paraplegia/paraperesis. This is a shattering complication of TB spondylitis. The early appearance is with low-grade fever, chills, weight loss, and nonspecific constitutional symptoms. This can as well be the initial sign of spinal disease with varying degrees of weakness, nerve-root compression and sensory involvement. Neurologic complications occur prematurely in spinal TB infecting the upper cervical spine and ranges from single nerve palsy to hemiparesis or quadriparesis.<br />_ Gastrointestinal tuberculosis. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is more ordinary in the developing world. Pathogenic methods included swallowing of sputum with direct seeding, hematogenous spread, and ingestion of milk from cows affected by bovine TB. History of fever, weight loss, anorexia and night sweats are general presenting symptoms. Other symptoms may also include abdominal pain, swelling, obstruction and hematochesia.<br />_ Genitourinary tuberculosis. This complication of tuberculosis is asymptomatic and the disease exposed only after destructive lesions of the kidneys have developed.

00abeedec6,A miracle in the works: JR Vezain on the road to recovery after severe back injury - Fence Post,"A miracle in the works: JR Vezain on the road to recovery after severe back injury<br />\""I just saw a twitch in my leg!\"" JR Vezain excitedly told his wife, Shelby while speaking with Tri-State Livestock News about his recent back injury.This is a big improvement over minimal sensations and reactions below the belly button of the bareback bronc rider since a bronc flipped over on him Sept. 22 in Pasadena, Texas.He has been at peace with the injury since the very beginning and knows there is a \""miracle in the works.\"" The bronc had gathered up the strength to buck, but ended up face to face with the chutes, resulting in the horse going over backward.Vezain knew immediately that he was injured, and in the short time it took for help to reach him, while in his \""own little world,\"" he heard a voice clearly tell him that he could either accept that his back is broke, he won\'t be able to use his legs, and his career is over, or he can give it all up to God right now, accept Him as the ultimate healer, and know that a miracle is coming.When asked what he needed by the first few to reach him laying in the arena dirt, Vezain simply responded, \""Prayers.\""\""I haven\'t doubted it from the beginning; I\'m going to be a walking miracle before too long,\"" he said. \""This will turn non-believers into believers for His glory.\""Recommended Stories For YouVezain began his journey at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, where he first received surgery the day after the accident fracturing the T10 vertebra and some of the T9. Doctors placed two rods and eight screws from T8 to T12 and fused it together to immobilize the fracture.\""It doesn\'t matter what the doctors say, God is the great healer, but they can\'t diagnose anything until the spinal cord swelling has gone down,\"" Vezain said. \""They can\'t give me outcomes; they\'re going off of me telling them I\'m walking out of here. If they give me a 1 percent chance, that\'s all I need to make it work.\""REHABVezain was moved to TIRR Memorial Hermann Rehabilitation & Research ewcently, where he has received a brace to immobilize his torso from twisting or torquing and was fitted for a chair the next day that will offer him some freedom. Earlier this month, he began workouts and physical therapy, which involved standing for some time, playing Wii, and using an electrode machine to get his leg muscles firing and responding.\""It finally feels good to get busy again and get to work,\"" Vezain said.He currently has very little sensation below his belly button. He can feel slight pressure in his high hip, and when reflexes were checked in his knees, he could feel tapping on his knee caps.For the next two to four weeks, Vezain will perform stage one of rehabilitation, learning to be mobile while respecting the amount of pressure his shifted spine can handle at TIRR, and while he must remain in a back brace for the next 10 to 12 weeks, he may move to a rehab center that can help him continue healing once the first stage is complete. He doesn\'t yet know where that will be.\""When I started this program, I told them they had never dealt with a guy quite like me,\"" he said. \""I didn\'t lose any upper body strength, so I don\'t have to work on my upper body to hold myself up; I just have to work on endurance.\""He is considering rehab facilities closer to home, but he will chose more on the facility\'s ability to help rather than proximity to home.\""We\'ll sacrifice whatever we have to to get the best place. I want to go to the place that will help me walk out,\"" he said.HUMBLING SITUATIONVezain\'s wife Shelby has been at his side from the very beginning, and, while they had planned on waiting to tell everyone their good news, the injury sped things along. JR and Shelby are expecting their first child in May 2019.\""I have a rockstar wife. She has been here since I\'ve been out of surgery,\"" he said.JR is a Wyoming native, and Shelby calls Montana home. The Vezains live a mile from Shelby\'s parents, TJ and Liane Newman, near Milestone, Mont. They just closed on a \""chunk of ground\"" this spring and also lease land in the area to run their cows and sheep.\""We have the makings to make our own,\"" JR said. \""I would love to just be horseback and work our ranch horseback. I\'m extremely excited for this new phase of life, and I\'m at ease if I never ride another bucking horse, if that\'s His plan. If I can, that\'s good too.\""The PRCA season ended Oct. 1 with JR qualifying for his sixth National Finals Rodeo, something that would have haunted some.\""I have a peace about it,\"" he said. \""I know God has a bigger plan than the NFR. I\'m blessed to have the career I did have. I want to be an inspiration for some young up-and-comers that would fill my shoes.\""A GoFundMe page has been set up as JR Vezain Recover Fund. \""I\'ve never been in a situation like this,\"" he said. \""It\'s overwhelmingly humbling.\"" ?",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEOANMl93Klp4ujgY8yt2jFTpDJ3A&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=RtfKW9C4HKPbzAa3qpCIBg&url=https://www.thefencepost.com/news/a-miracle-in-the-works-jr-vezain-on-the-road-to-recovery-after-severe-back-injury/,EN,,20/10/2018 07:20,2018-10-19 13:42:12+00:00,f391c0214d,Fence Post,,,,,1539963732,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
00cb179d82,The Making of the Sub-Saharan Wasteland - The Atlantic,"From 1974: The Making of the Sub-Saharan Wasteland<br />On the southern rim of the biggest desert on earth, following its contours around a ninth of the planet from the Atlantic to the Nile, an immense tract of land known as the Sahel-2.5 million miles square, a fifth of all Africa-is slipping out of human use. Intensely hot and eternally parched for rain, it was never much good at sustaining life; its people are among the poorest in the world. Now, its thin blanket of coarse grass and thorny bush is giving way to sterile sand. Live dunes, deadly killers of every growing thing, are forming in the midst of old grazing lands and on the very banks of flowing rivers. For mile after mile, nothing is left to show where the great Sahara ends and the Sahel begins.It is a calamity of biblical dimensions, but God doesn\'t really come into it. The fact that several hundred thousand people and some 20 million head of livestock have starved to death in the Sahel lately after five terrible years of drought is nothing new. Terrible droughts have afflicted this region time and again. One, which lasted seven years, occurred exactly a century ago. The climate, hint though it may of celestial wrath, doesn\'t appear to have taken a lasting turn for the worse since about 3000 B.C. The little deserts emerging from a ruined veil of green are not always or necessarily contiguous to the big one above. Nor is there any truth to the legend of a colossal Sahara advancing inexorably for reasons men cannot fathom. Men can fathom the reasons, all right. They can even force the desert back, provided they can find the resolve to make sensible use of all the money now flooding into the stricken Sahel. Alas, that resolve is not so easily come by.Horrifying pictures of skeletal children and desiccated cows first appeared in the press a year or so ago, but people whose work is the dispensation of aid have known about the Sahel for quite a while. Hundreds of millions of dollars a year have in fact been pumped into the region since colonies became independent in the late 1950s. The results make an unusually interesting case study, considering all the aid given, and taken, in the name of development the world over.Africans have less meat to eat than anybody else in the world. They are spending hard currency-in short supply when they have it at all-to import food of any kind for a continent with one of the world\'s highest birthrates. Properly run, the Sahel should be able to raise enough beef on the hoof for half this hungry continent. Yet after almost fifteen years of bountiful international aid and more than bountiful advice, the Sahel is closer than ever to becoming a wasteland.Statistics are too unreliable to tell us precisely how much of the Sahel is hopelessly desertified already. The Chad government says half its enormous country is gone. Mauritania\'s Fifth and Sixth Regions, the most populated, are adrift in loose sand. The fertile marshlands of Senegal\'s Niayes Region, dotted with moving dunes now are smothering in it. Ecologists speak of desert encroachment elsewhere running to twenty and thirty miles a year. The U.S. Agency for International Development thinks the whole region has lost a quarter of a million square miles in the past half century.It would be nice to blame this on something we can do nothing about, such as the climate. Sensational headlines have indeed suggested a sinister climatic change, a possible southward shift in the earth\'s monsoon rain belt leaving new deserts be­hind not just in the Sahel, but all along the same drought-blasted parallel from Brazil to India to China. Even if climatologists were sure of this theory, and they aren\'t, it would simply add to rather than explain the Sahelians\' troubles. Desertification was pinching their lives long before the rains failed here in 1968. The Sahelians have brought it upon themselves; and we-the rich, industrialized, superbly skilled, and technically superior we-have in effect been egging them on.It is hard to say just who deserves what prominence in this elaborate mosaic of human guilt. The daily damage is naturally done by the people trying to force a living out of their godforsaken land: there are about 22 million in the largely Sahelian West African states of Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Niger, Upper Volta, Chad; and twice as many in a dozen states with smaller pockets of Sahelian territory, including Nigeria, Gambia, Cameroon, Ghana, Togo, Dahomey, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan. But people struggling to stay alive amid incredible hardships cannot be judged too harshly. The worst offenders are those high above and far away. They include the politicians who preside over these states\' governments. And they include a long list of foreign benefactors-from the United Nations and the World Bank to the United States and Canada, France, Germany, and other Common Market members, Scandinavia, the Arab oil states, the People\'s Republic of China-who, in try­ing to deliver these nomads and their herds from thirst, have further exposed them to hunger.This is not to belittle the magnificent rescue operation mounted last summer by most of these do­nors (the Arabs and Chinese were not among them), who rushed more than half a million tons of food to starving Sahelians in the nick of time. The cost, over $175 million, was barely a measure of the effort going into this display of international solidarity and compassion. But apart from keeping a lot of Sahelians alive last year, it hasn\'t changed the situation. The Sahelians need almost twice as much emergency food aid this year, and there is no telling about next year. The Sahel is still heading straight for a breakdown; one more drought like this and it could be done for.It came pretty close this time. The worst was supposedly over when I spent six weeks in the West African Sahel last autumn. Yet wherever I went, traveling by plane, Land Rover, and bush taxi for thousands of miles from the west coast of Mauritania and Senegal inland to Bamako, Ouagadougou, and Niamey, and north to Agadez and Gao on the threshold of the Grand Sahara, the wreckage was distressingly evident. After the first day, I stopped counting the skeletons of cows, donkeys, and camels strewn by the wayside, their bones long since picked clean by vultures. Nor could I keep track of the dead and dying trees bowed in haunting arches of lifeless gray over acre upon acre of the empty bush. Here and there, far off on the cracked, crumbling land, l saw a few camels and goats; but not for hundreds of miles at a stretch did I see a cow. Dozens of villages I passed were abandoned, the doors of their huts ajar, their wells dried up or tainted with rotting animal carcasses. In those still inhabited, farmers told me of having eaten their millet seed before they could plant it, or sharing meager government food rations with the few goats they had left: \""If they go, it\'s finished,\"" one said.Once well away from the capitals, nearly every village was encircled by nomad refugee tents. (The only countries where I saw a nomad in the capital were Mauritania, whose population is 80 percent nomadic, and Niger, where tourists were stopped in their tracks at the sight of a veiled and be­daggered Tuareg warrior striding across the hotel lobby.) The nomads were in deplorable physical condition and a worse state of mental shock. \""They are dazed, stupefied, some go crazy,\"" a Mauritanian official explained. \""They simply can\'t take in the fact that their herds have been wiped out overnight.\""There were 9000 nomad refugees in Mederdra, Mauritania, when I passed through, more than doubling the population of a settlement that used to be a green oasis, half-buried in sand now. Nearly all had lost one or more children, a parent, aged relatives. Several I met were the sole survivors of large families. A handful had managed to save half a dozen sheep or goats from herds once a hundred times bigger. Most had lost that and everything else but the rags on their backs. Bit by bit, on their exhausting march toward safety, they had been forced to abandon the last of their cherished possessions: rugs, blankets, precious stores of mint tea and salt, their gay and handsome Moorish tents.So weakened was the will even to live, I was told, that older people were turning to suicide. Though enough emergency grain from foreign relief shipments was getting through to assure their survival while I was there-I\'m not sure if it still is-they were ridden with scurvy, beriberi, ma­rasmus, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis. Scores of children whose resistance was lowered by under­ nourishment were dying of measles and whooping cough, the schoolmaster said; every child in Mederdra was suffering from vitamin deficiencies.Mederdra was not unique. Mauritania, hardest hit by drought and famine of all the Sahelian states, has had practically no harvest at all for two years now, and has only 600,000 cattle left out of 2.5 million. \""We are a nation on the dole,\"" the governor of the Sixth Region told me in Rosso, the regional capital.Devoutly religious, the Moors were making it all more bearable by sharing what little food they had. \""No good Moslem has the right to eat while his neighbor is hungry,\"" explained the Mederdra schoolmaster, who had taken in twenty-six distant nomad relatives himself (paying for food for all of them on his slender salary; and letting them camp in and around the tent he had to call home for lack of the money to rent a modest house). Not one of the relatively privileged Moors I met was free of such burdens. \""There are no more rich and poor here-we\'re all indigent,\"" said the prefect of R\'Kiz, who was feeding twenty refugees daily at his own table. But the treatment was less generous elsewhere.The military government of Mali had banned all visitors from the refugee camps when I got to Gao, after distressing stories had filtered out about camp conditions. Relief workers, no longer permitted to enter themselves, told me of four hundred children, all of whose parents had died, living alone in a cluster of tents. In one of the tents, seven children had squatted for days around the body of their dead mother, waiting for her to \""wake up.\"" In another, a baby kept sucking at her dead mother\'s breast. In Bourem, on the road from Gao to Timbuktu, nomad refugees were dying like flies.Conditions were better in Niger, but not that much. More solicitous than Mali about the nomads\' welfare, the Niger government was also much less nervous about inquisitive foreigners. No sooner did President Diori Hamani grasp the enormity of the human devastation than he begged the Red Cross to handle it. Under the direction of two young and wonderfully efficient Scandinavian volunteers, the Red Cross had long since fattened up starving children in its care when I reached the country-mostly by bundling them off every morning to be fed milk and chocolate behind closed doors. But if grown-ups in the camps were no longer dying at the rate of twenty and thirty a day, they were still on near-starvation rations. The Red Cross had no more food than that for the camps, and none at all for thousands too far away to reach a camp, or too frightened to set foot in one. Those I saw myself, in western Niger and northern Agades, bore all the familiar marks of hunger and privation.There is no way of knowing how many have died so far, in spite of international intervention. The toll is probably highest in Ethiopia, where at least 100,000 are believed to have perished before the government so much as mentioned that anything odd was going on in the interior. But it could run to hundreds of thousands in the West African Sahel as well. Mortality would have been lower in both places, at any rate, if the West African governments hadn\'t waited six months, and Ethiopia\'s a full year, to act on early disaster warnings from the United Nation\'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).When the warning came in September 1972, the monsoon rains had failed for four years in a row nearly everywhere, right across these African latitudes and beyond. The southern Sahelian farm­ lands got less than half their usual share of rain. The hotter and drier rangelands closer to the Sahara were hit harder, dropping from a few miserable inches of yearly rainfall to almost none. Where any grass came up at all, it couldn\'t conceivably feed some 60 million head of Sahelian livestock. Nor, with grain shortfalls of 30 percent in Upper Volta, 50 percent in Mali, Niger, and Senegal, 85 percent in Mauritania, could southern crops possibly feed the human population.Called upon so desperately late in the day to provide over 600,000 tons of emergency grain-this at a time when Soviet Russia had bought up a quarter of the American wheat crop and U.S. harbors were crammed with cargo ships loading for Russian ports-the donor-states worked wonders. The United States contributed 256,000 tons of cereals, the Common Market 111,000, France 70,000, smaller donors enough to make up the difference. The main lifeline started in Kansas, got through overcrowded American ports, and reached the West African coast in record time. The ports there were few: Nouakchott (Mauritania), Dakar (Senegal), Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Tema (Ghana), Cotonou (Dahomey); and not many were well equipped. Moving shipments inland to landlocked states such as Mali, Niger, Upper Volta, and Chad was arduous. Mauritania has less than a hundred miles of paved road in a territory of 398,000 square miles, while Mali is the only one of the landlocked states with rail outlets to the sea. At this stage the Sahelian governments pitched in themselves, or most did, to move the grain out into the bush. But it came too late to save everybody, and would have been too late for a good many if an international airlift had not been hastily organized to drop grain where starvation was only a few days, or hours, away.About 25,000 tons of food were dropped by air­ lift, at a cost of around fifty million dollars. The FAO chartered some planes, and others were provided by the Belgians, West Germans, French, British, Dutch, Spanish, Canadians, Norwegians, Ghanaians, Libyans, Russians, and Americans. The U.S. Air Force was especially gallant, flying three and four loads a day and landing its clumsy Hercules workhorse on strips no other pilots would touch. W hen I flew with the Americans on one of their last trips to Nema, in eastern Mauritania, the pilot put his Hercules down on a pockmarked and pocket-sized landing strip with the light grace of a Piper Cub.            ·The man was rare, among the hundreds I talked with in these countries, who saw anything but blind destiny behind the dreadful scourge visited upon him. Yet the worst of this tragedy has been the blindness of man himself.Those who actually live in the Sahel are not generally aware of doing anything wrong. They certainly understand one of its iron laws: In a land where nature is extraordinarily parsimonious, they are extraordinarily frugal. You may travel from one end of it to the other without ceasing to wonder at their frugality, let alone their patience and physical endurance. Nothing is wasted: not a stick or dead branch, blade of grass, stalk of grain, drop of water. I saw women walking ten miles under a scorching sun to gather an armful of firewood or collect tiny prickly balls of cram-cram, a kind of wild oat, for the family\'s supper. In Mali\'s Dogon country, I saw millet planted in savagely eroded gullies on plots of topsoil barely a few yards square, laboriously fenced in with straw matting to ward off goats and windblown sand. All morning long, men walked back and forth to a shallow pool of rainwater about a hundred yards away, carrying water in a calabash the size of a soup tureen to sprinkle over the wilting shoots, one cupped handful at a time.All the same, they are overtaxing a region on peculiarly precarious terms with the elements, and squandering what little it has to offer. Lying roughly between the fourteenth and eighteenth parallels above the Equator, the Sahel rarely gets more than thirty-five inches of rain a year at its southernmost point, tapering off to an inch or two on approaching the Sahara. Millet and sorghum will grow south of the fourteen-inch rainfall line. Little, if anything, will grow north of the line, except hardy acacia and tamarisk trees, and prairie grasses for grazing livestock. Nowhere does the grazing last long enough to support a herd the year round. Since most of the rain falls between late June and early October, the rest of the year must be gotten through at baking temperatures that shoot past 130 degrees before relief comes with the next rainy season. During those searing days, the relentless harmattan wind blows from the north, carrying off the dry topsoil. The rains, when they come, are torrential, and more topsoil swirls away in a sea of yellow mud.Desert folklore to the contrary, nomads are not incurable romantics who wander at random. Their unending trek through the bush in quest of forage for great herds of camels, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats is really a marvelously intricate design for living. Whether the nomads move in a small hundred-mile circle or fan out for thousands of miles across several national borders, they know exactly where they are sup­posed to go, and how long they are expected to linger in each place. Tribal chiefs charted the routes centuries ago, and no nomad can break ranks without regretting it.Desert folklore also to the contrary, though, nomads are not infallibly wise about their land, as donor-states have learned to their sorrow. Long be­fore galloping desertification set in about a decade ago, the Sahel was showing brutal signs of wear and tear. The ominous live dunes turning up now in the great bend of the Niger River-a good three hundred miles south of where a live dune has any climatic reason to be-didn\'t get there simply because the rains have failed of late for five years running. They were invited there by soil trampled to death by the nomads\' cattle, year after year, on their way to drink at the river\'s edge.Other time-honored nomad practices include overgrazing by larger herds than the land can sup­port; lopping acacia branches to round out the herds\' diet; chopping down any trees at hand for firewood; and, in every dry season, setting the whole Sahel ablaze by lighting bush fires absent­ mindedly or deliberately, to hunt fleeing desert rats. While all this has been going on a long while, nature had her own rude ways of keeping it in check until recently. Every now and then, say once in twenty or thirty years, a drought would come along to cut down the human and animal population, giving trees and grass a chance to recover; and in between, the balance was kept by early death. The most common human diseases in the Sahel are smallpox, leprosy, trachoma, tuberculosis, syphilis, severe and often fatal measles, sleeping sickness, malaria, and a variety of internal parasites. What with that and chronic malnutrition, one in every seven Sahelian babies dies before it is a year old, half die before they are ten, and few live to see forty. The herds that are the nomads\' sole sustenance are no better off. Underfed Sahelian cows frequently miscarry, and seldom calve more than once every other year; half the calves die of hunger or disease in their first year; and two or three in every ten survivors are likely to die off each year thereafter.This is plainly a wretched sort of ecological balance, and hundreds of millions of dollars have gone into upsetting it since development aid began. On the request of more or less indigent Sahel governments, whose populations have average incomes of sixty to ninety dollars a year, the donor-states have done their best to lengthen the life-span of man and beast alike: with health schemes, education schemes, mass vaccinations against smallpox, measles, sleeping sickness, and cattle rinderpest. They have also spent a fortune on what is supposed to be the cure for anything and everything ailing this sickly region: more water. The last operation in particular has been brilliantly successful, but the patient is reeling.Deep down beneath layers of rock, clay, and sand, the Sahel and Sahara both are awash in water. A subterranean lake half a million miles square underlies the eastern end of the desert from Libya to Chad, and the Grand Sahara itself sits astride a still larger underground body of water known as Savourin\'s Sea. Most of the water is too far down to be reached by a manual well-digger. But mechanical rigs can tap it at one or two thou­ sand feet. By now the Sahel is crisscrossed with thousands of deep boreholes, drilled at a cost of between $20,000 to $200,000 apiece. Whether by pump or natural artesian pressure, water gushes up in such prodigal abundance that ten thousand head of cattle at a time can drink their fill.The trouble is that wherever the Sahel has suddenly produced more than enough for the cattle to drink, they have ended up with nothing to eat. Few sights were more appalling, at the height of the drought last summer, than the thousands upon thousands of dead and dying cows clustered around Sahelian boreholes. Indescribably emaciated, the dying would stagger away from the water with bloated bellies and struggle to fight free of the churned mud at the water\'s edge until they keeled over. As far as the horizon and be­ yond, the earth was as bare and bleak as a bad dream. Drought alone didn\'t do that: they did.What 20 million or more cows, sheep, goats, donkeys, and camels have mostly died of since this grim drought set in is hunger, not thirst. Al­though many would have died anyway, the tragedy was compounded by a fierce struggle for too little food among Sahelian herds increased by then to vast numbers. Carried away by the promise of unlimited water, nomads forgot about the Sahel\'s all too limited forage. Timeless rules, apportioning just so many cattle to graze for just so many days within a cow\'s walking distance of just so much water in traditional wells, were brushed aside. Enormous herds, converging upon the new bore­holes from hundreds of miles away, so ravaged the surrounding land by trampling and overgrazing that each borehole quickly became the center of its own little desert forty or fifty miles square.As the herds kept multiplying, they competed more and more ravenously for the last inch of forage. Yet even when the competition led to ferocious tribal warfare-in 1969 the Mali government had to send troops to break up a particularly violent clash between Tuaregs and Fulanis north of Mopti-the nomads kept breeding and buying more and more cattle. In Senegal, soon after boreholes came into fashion around 1960, the number of cows, sheep, and goats rose in just two years from 4 million to 5 million. In Mali, during the five years before 1960, the increase had been only 800,000. Over the next ten years the total shot up another 5 million to 16 million, more than three animals for every Malien man, woman, and child.Nobody knows what lasting harm has come to the rangelands in these five years. Accustomed to the harshest weather, much of the vegetative cover may spring back to life when the rains finally come, if not this summer then next. But where starving herds have torn it out, roots and all, before seeds could form, it may not. The stomachs of four in every five cows reaching slaughterhouses last summer showed they had literally eaten in to the ground, ingesting sand. The cover will almost surely not spring back to life where piratical winds carry off four or five tons of topsoil an acre. Nor is there much hope where trampling hooves have pounded it to dust. There is still less hope of groundwater tables ever rising again to their old levels.Crop losses have been all the more shattering because nomads who used to have meat and milk no longer have anything but grain to rely on. The West African Sahel states, through the secretary of their Inter-Regional Drought Committee, Antoine Dakouré, have claimed they need 1,230,000 tons of emergency grain to tide them over until next October\'s harvest. Allowances must always be made for the impetuous M. Dakouré, who electrified reporters in Paris last January by asserting more flatly than accurately that five in every seven babies had already died in some parts of the Sahel, and 200,000 grown­ ups were going to follow suit in the next few weeks. Even so, donor-states think that about 900,000 tons of grain are required.Livestock losses have cut these countries\' foreign earnings in half; they can\'t possibly buy the grain they need. Nor is it so readily given away in this of all years. Russian inroads on last year\'s crops have depleted American grain stocks to the lowest level since the war. Exceptional appeals for relief from all corners of the globe have so reduced sup­plies everywhere else that the reserves of all grain­ exporting countries combined, enough to feed the world for fifty-one days in 1971, would last only twenty-nine days in 1974. This alone has forced worldwide wheat prices up by 300 percent; and that is nothing compared to the prices in store as the energy crisis hits the cost of fertilizer and ship­ping. There is little doubt that many more Sahelians will starve to death if more grain is not forth­ coming. It is hard to think the world will let that happen. But it isn\'t so easy, either, to imagine the world keeping much or most of the Sahel on the dole forever. As far as the nomads go, that might well be the prospect.The nomads are still there, in miserable tent camps strung across the Sahel, almost all remote from the nearest capital. Most of the camp inmates are women and children. Their menfolk died with the last of the cattle they tried to save, by staying behind to wait for rain, or pressing too far southward into the sleeping-sickness belt in search of forage. They are penniless, the haughtiest of Tuaregs among them reduced to begging. Their herds have been practically wiped out: If livestock mortality has run to about 40 percent for the whole Sahel, it has been closer to 90 and 100 per­ cent in the nomads\' drier rangelands. So weakened are the surviving bulls and so decimated the female ranks-two in every three cows going to slaughter in Niamey, Niger, last year were pregnant-that it will probably take eight or ten years to rebuild the herds. Meanwhile, the nomads face an incomparably blacker future than the farmers, whose crops are bound to grow again next summer or the one after. In fact, they would appear to have no future at all.Never, when asked, do these nomads fail to say that their old way of life is finished. \""No more paradise,\"" a wonderfully vibrant and handsome Tuareg widow told me over ritual glasses of mint tea in her Niamey refugee tent. \""Just give us something else to do and we\'ll do it.\"" The Grand Marabout of Timbuktu, a tiny shriveled sage clearly held in awe by the dozen or so other Tuaregs crowding into the tent to meet us, nodded gravely. So did they. Yet they all admitted, when pressed, that every cent they could beg or borrow was going into a kitty to buy and build up new herds. Not one appeared to think the size of their old herds might have contributed in any way to the agonies they had just gone through. \""Given a chance,\"" said a volunteer relief worker passing all his days and most of his nights among them, \""they\'d go right ahead and do the same thing all over again.\""  Whether they continue as they have will depend, then, on whether, through pity, inertia, or dark design, their governments and rich foreign friends let them.I met a number of foreign development experts traveling around the Sahel-you can scarcely turn around there nowadays without bumping into one-who told me privately that, in effect, they are writing off the nomads and their rangelands. They seldom said it in so many words, not being given to simple declarative sentences. But what they were evidently trying to tell me was that there just isn\'t enough talent and patience, let alone money, lying around to get out of this impossible situation. Since such situations cannot easily be ignored in our day and age (the Emperor of Ethiopia\'s day and age is something else again), a decent effort to relieve human misery obviously has to be made. Accordingly, these experts suggest keeping the nomads on the dole until they can pick up a few cows and goats, and then turning them loose in the bush again, fortified by the standard aid treatment for people in their condition: vaccinations and mobile health units, powdered milk for the children, pilot projects for cutting hay or storing rainwater, even more boreholes if that will keep them happy and off the politicians\' backs. When they have \""destroyed their only means of survival in the struggle to survive,\"" as a U.N. Development Program official in Dakar put it to me bitterly, nature will come up with the Final Solution.This may well be how it all ends, but it doesn\'t absolutely have to be. There is no need for a million-dollar MIT computer study, one of U.S. AID\'s more exotic contributions, to figure out how the Sahel can be turned into a paying proposition. One way came to light in infrared photographs taken by satellite last year, showing a bright-green patch in western Niger surrounded by sandy rubble. It turned out to be a 250,000-acre cattle ranch, where grass and trees have been restored to sturdy health with nothing more than strictly rotated grazing and a fence to keep out all four­legged intruders, especially goats, who nibble to the roots and will eat anything in sight.Ranches like this, which support only about 10,000 cattle, are fine for whoever happens to own one but not necessarily for everybody else. They could even be dangerous, if held up as an example to prove that nomads ought to stop roaming around and settle down, as their governments have been telling them to do for years (whether the better to help them or to keep an eye on them is an open question). If all the nomads really did settle down, their delicately balanced rangelands would go to pieces altogether in short order. Actually, the most ingenious and efficient way to make the best of these lands was worked out by their own ancestors. They could hardly do better, provided the lesson of that Niger ranch is driven home to them.The real turnaround in the Sahel would lie in a combination of ancient nomadic practices and modern range management. The nomads would keep on the move with the seasons, as always. But their herds would be much smaller, better fed and cared for. Grazing would be allocated by new and still more inflexible rules. Water, whether in wells or boreholes, would be spaced out to service only the cattle allowed to graze in the vicinity, and boreholes would be shut down in alternating years to give the pasture a rest. Healthier cows would calve two or three times oftener, and calves would be sold off at the age of one or two years instead of the prevailing seven or eight, to relieve pressure on grazing lands. Once sold, they would go on to feedlots where, fattened on peanutseed or cotton­seed cake grown by southern farmers, they could be brought up to a weight of eight or nine hundred pounds within two years instead of the present six. Since the feedlots would be handy to slaughterhouses, the cattle would no longer lose most of that weight again by trekking as far as fifteen hundred miles to market.All kinds of improvements might be written into this idealistic scenario: man-made catchments to store rainwater, little vegetable plots around them, simple storage facilities for millet in the event of drought, cut and stored fodder for the herds against the same eventuality. To save what is left of the grazing lands, trees would obviously have to be replanted in the millions; and to save these tender young saplings as well as the grazing lands, the goals would have to go. Almost any body in the aid game would tell you to stop right there.The least picky about food of any animal, and the closest by far to being indestructible, goats are the poor man\'s cows here as everywhere. Few Sahelian politicians have the courage to suggest getting rid of them. (President Leopold Senghor of Senegal has tried to for six years and gotten nowhere.) This alone could wreck almost any plans for the Sahel, and it is a relatively minor obstacle.It shouldn\'t be impossible to persuade nomad tribal chiefs of the need to do what in effect they have always done, only better. Persuade is the operative word, the nomad being rare who ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oes anything an alien government orders him to do. But the chances of persuasion are none too good where the sides are barely on speaking terms. Mauritania, with its mostly nomadic million-odd inhabitants, doesn\'t have this problem, and Niger is trying to overcome it. Elsewhere, though," relations are no better than might be expected between \""""white\"""" nomads of Mediterranean stock accustomed for centuries to be overlords", and their former black slaves, the new rulers of liberated Africa.Faced with these and countless other crushing problems, Sahelian governments have been inclined to feel that it will  all go away if they can only get their hands on enough money. At their drought conference in Ouagadougou last September, the six West African states started out by asking for an extra $10 billion. They have since come down to about $1 billion, double the present amount of aid, and will probably get it. Western donors may be running out of spare wheat but aren\'t yet dead to all sentiment. Apart from these same old benefactors, Senegal for one will be getting $50 million from the People\'s Republic of China, while Mauritania has been promised $11 million from Kuwait, $20 million from Saudi Arabia, and $22 million from Libya.None of the Arab money appears to have been earmarked for wheat purchases. Nor is anyone quite sure about what is actually going to be done with the Arabs\' or any other dollars. The Sahel governments simply accept the donations, in an atmosphere of reciprocal and benevolent confusion.Yet when one U.S. AID mission arrived last spring with $20 million to spend on the spot, the projects that were down on paper and worth doing added up to only half that amount.             Not that these countries can\'t find something to do with the money: They need practically everything. But wherever it ends up, it isn\'t going into a rational plan of range management for the Sahel.Among the items on their billion-dollar shopping list, the six West African Sahel states jointly have suggested only $26 million for reforestation, enough to stabilize about 50,000 acres in a territory of 2.5 million square miles. But demands for water development projects come to $200 million, a sizable chunk of it for more boreholes.It is only too easy to understand the obsessive longing for water here. Yet no amount of it below ground can work the magic Sahelians dream of, assuring the pasture over vast prairies that only rain can provide. Whether they cannot or would rather not see that fact, Sahelian politicians have yet to mention it to their importunate constituents. If some of the wells and boreholes they are demanding now are meant for villagers, who need them badly," a frightening number are meant for herds which not one of these countries has seriously proposed to control. \""""As far as we know", there will be no controls and no power to impose them,"\"""" I was told by a top man at FED"," the Common Market\'s Development Fund. \""""It\'s insane. We\'re tearing our hair out.\""""Insane or not", FED itself is putting up millions for new boreholes. So is FAC, the French Aid and Cooperation Mission, as are the World Bank, the U.N. Development Program, the West Germans," and so on. Only the United States has refused unequivocally to drill another borehole in the Sahel without the assurance of \""""sound guidelines\""""-a policy it has followed since refusing to drill two hundred more for Niger in 1967. \""""What the other donors do is on their own heads","\"""" an AID official remarked to me privately. \""""We don\'t want any part of this psychological copout.\""""It is an apt description for a policy bound to doom the Sahel in the end while keeping the nomads happy for the briefest of interludes. \""""Too many of our projects have been singularly nonproductive", and we tediously re-introduce some which should never have been tried in the first place, with results from indifferent to disastrous,"\"""" wrote the author of a recent in-house AID report. \""""The time bomb is undirected water development","\"""" he added"," rightly.An FED spokesman concurred: \""""But if we don\'t drill the boreholes", the Arabs will,"\"""" he observed", also rightly. A ranking U.N. official, in perfect agreement with the FED spokesman," nevertheless admitted in the same breath that nothing has done more than these boreholes to hasten the advance of the world\'s biggest desert. \""""We donors have a lot to answer for","\"""" he said.

Now, years later, my husband and I are parents to two incredible children. My story is not unique,\' she said.   \'I made the decision that was best for me - to have an abortion - and was able to get compassionate care at a clinic in my own community. Now, years later, my husband and I are parents to two incredible children. My story is not unique Ilyse Hogue, present of NARAL Pro-Choice America Hogue said she believes she is the first woman to speak about a voluntary abortion at either major party\'s convention. That\'s perhaps shocking since the issue of abortion has become one of the forefront issues in the presidential race, in Congress and the Supreme Court. In hoping to de-stigmatize the procedure, Hogue decided to speak from her personal experience. \'About 1 in 3 American women have abortions by the age of 45, and the majority are mothers just trying to take care of the families they already have,\' Hogue said. \'You see, it\'s not as simple as bad girls get abortions and good girls have families. We are the same women at different times in our lives - each making decisions that are the best for us.\'\'We need a president who has the experience, the wisdom and the grit to stand up against the bullies. We need a president who knows that women\'s rights are human rights,\' Hogue said. Hillary Clinton, who will accept the Democratic nomination on Thursday, is pro-choice but her opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump, has said he believes women should be punished for going through with abortions.  Hogue went on to say that abortion rights aren\'t just \'women\'s issues\' but have an impact on the \'very foundation of our freedom\'.   FULL TRANSCRIPT OF ILYSE HOGUE\'S SPEECH AT THE DNC Texas women are tough. We approach challenges with clear eyes and full hearts. To succeed in life, all we need are the tools, the trust, and the chance to chart our own path. I was fortunate enough to have these things when I found out I was pregnant years ago. I wanted a family, but it was the wrong time. I made the decision that was best for me - to have an abortion - and was able to get compassionate care at a clinic in my own community. Now, years later, my husband and I are parents to two incredible children.My story is not unique. About one in three American women have abortions by the age of 45, and the majority are mothers just trying to take care of the families they already have. You see, it\'s not as simple as bad girls get abortions and good girls have families. We are the same women at different times in our lives - each making decisions that are the best for us.If we want families to succeed, we start by empowering women. Give us accurate information and access to health care. Keep politicians out of our business when we\'re not ready to parent, and support us when we are. That\'s what gives our families the best chance to get ahead and stay ahead. And that is what Hillary Clinton has spent decades fighting for.Donald Trump is different. He said women who have abortions should be punished. He calls women \""pigs\"" and says breastfeeding is \""disgusting.\""Now some people think he doesn\'t really mean any of that. But, look who he picked for VP.Mike Pence led the charge to defund Planned Parenthood, pushed to let hospitals turn a woman away if she needs an abortion to save her life, and signed a bill with some of the most outrageous abortion restrictions in the country. He has even said he can\'t wait to send Roe v. Wade \""into the ash heap of history.\"" Together, Donald Trump and Mike Pence have united to form the \""make misogyny great again\"" ticket.And the people who so loudly oppose abortion rights? Let me let you in on their dirty little secret: They\'re not only against abortions. Many of these people are also fighting to restrict access to contraception and block commonsense policies to support working moms.It\'s not abortion that bothers them. It\'s empowering women to live our own lives. When we have power over our own destiny, we not only strengthen our families, we honor our most cherished traditions of liberty and equality.These aren\'t just \""women\'s issues\"" - these are the very foundation of our freedom.We need a president who has the experience, the wisdom, and the grit to stand up against the bullies. We need a president who knows that \""women\'s rights are human rights.\"" We need a president who will keep expanding the frontiers of freedom for all Americans.We need Hillary Clinton.  <br />Share or comment on this article<br />References^ Ashley Collman For Dailymail.com (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNE3FeQEJ9ZJdnc9aQnNjDxq7dzgFg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779168768865&ei=1v6aV8jeLMbP1Qb4s5vIBQ&url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3712583/It-wrong-time-Pro-choice-activist-makes-history-woman-speak-abortion-party-convention.html,EN,,29/07/2016 07:15,2016-07-28 11:34:27+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,Daily Mail,,,,,1469712867,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
00edfcef8b,"The Young Pope, Episodes 5 And 6: The LMFAO Pope - MTV.com","The Young Pope, Episodes 5 And 6: The LMFAO Pope<br />The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing us there was only one Young Pope airing per week.<br />Good afternoon, my fellow yungpopeheads. I\'m sure you know this already, eternally youthful popeheads that you are, but unbeknownst to us at MTV News, who have been blessed - nay, cursed - with Young Pope screeners, HBO has been airing two Young Pope episodes a week instead of one, like a normal person or cable network would. Sometimes three, even! Why, you ask? We can no easier explain HBO\'s cockamamie machinations than we can explain why the sky is blue, why the pope is American when Jude Law has a European accent already, why the Italians on this show speak English to each other in private, who Federico is, who is blackmailing Diane Keaton, or why the pope is young ... God, he\'s so, so young.<br />My editor and I realized this in a cold sweaty panic only this week, because we are but young non-popes, unlikely to ever become heads of state or church or even a low-stakes DMV. To make up for our grave mistake, we are going to be recapping the remaining six episodes in pairs and saying 600 Hail Marys while flogging ourselves with a shredded photo of Jude Law\'s butt. The good news (besides the butt thing) is, now, should we feel so inclined, we can skim over the parts where the Yung Pope sits across from someone and talks in a steady stream for 15 minutes to discordant techno.<br />The Yung Pope is topless in bed, dreaming of watching his fuckin\' hot parents leave him via boat. I love the idea that his parents were like, \""Hm, we\'re attractive hippies, no time for parenting, G2G.\"" Honestly, they\'re right. Hot hippies should not parent; parenting is neither chill nor hot. Anyway, it\'s been at least 40 years since this all went down, so dude really needs to get over this whole \""my parents left me, so I have to ruin the Catholic Church\"" thing. Like, Harry Potter\'s parents were brutally murdered in front of him and all he did was be a cute and happy wizard. <br />The Yung Pope tells Tommaso he is going to start a revolution in his Juicy suit. Same.<br />The Yung Pope appears deeply angered by a painting of a man with breasts who is feeding a baby. Either the Yung Pope wants breasts to better fill out the top portion of his Pope Juicy suit, or he is upset that this baby was not deserted by fuckin\' hot hippie parents.<br />The Yung Pope has his most sympathetic moment yet with Esther, who almost successfully seduces him by placing his hands on her belly and praying to Mary for a miracle. She casually inches his hand up to her boobs. The Yung Pope is like, \""Eh, I\'ll allow it, this seems pope-ish to me.\"" But he explains to her that he cannot love her, because loving humans is too painful, and he\'s a coward, because his parents left him on a midnight hippie boat to Venice. DANG MY MAN. GET. OVER. IT. From the way he carries on, you would think Lenny Belardo was the only kid whose fuckin\' hot parents ever decided they were too fuckin\' hot to be parents and needed to be about that boat life. <br />Flashback to Yung Lenny and his lesser-saint ginger peer. The boys run away from the convent in the rain to ... watch a cute li\'l chub tend to his sick mother? <br />Oh, fucking of course, they\'re going to find Yung Lenny\'s mom and dad. Lenny. They. Are. Living. The. Boat. Life. You\'re on a prairie. Go home and hang out with Diane Keaton, you lucky mofo! Back in the present day, the Yung Pope and his Lesser-Saint Ginger Peer are sitting on tiny beds, joking about how the Yung Pope is a total dick and always has been. They decide to go on a \""cigarette run\"" at 3 a.m. The only positive thing about this whole development is that the Yung Pope gets a little Jon Hamm-y in his Juicy suit.<br />Voiello wants to hit it and never quit it with Diane Keaton. The sentiment is not exactly returned. Diane Keaton inexplicably pets Voiello\'s son-friend like a dog. Diane. Come on. Voiello hands Diane Keaton a flash drive with the Yung Pope\'s boob-touchin\' photos, and says, \""NVM about that whole blackmail thing. The Pope really is a saint.\"" It\'s unclear what motivated him to change his mind re: blackmailing the Yung Pope; perhaps it was how well the Yung Pope fills out them Juicy pants!!!<br />The Yung Pope and his Lesser Saint Ginger Peer meet with a sex worker, as upstanding men of the cloth are wont to do. They spend about five minutes talking to her, then leave ... ? \""I have proof of the existence of God,\"" she says. \""You, being fuckin\' hot.\"" If you find yourself wondering, \""Do popes really visit sex workers at 3 a.m. just to have friendly chats??\"" you have fallen directly into the black hole of ignorance, the hole that allows you to forget, even temporarily, that you are watching<br />The Yung Pope and His Lesser Saint Ginger Peer are eating street food and talking about miracles. LSGP is like, \""Remember that time that you did that thing ...\"" The Yung Pope is like, \""No!!!!! Let me eat my greasy street fare in peace!\"" LSGP replies, \""You are my best friend.\"" Seems like an extremely healthy and two-way best friendship, yes. The two continue their midnight stroll about the city, doing their best Before Sunrise. <br />In the past and present day, Diane Keaton joyfully greets Yung Lenny/Yung Pope and LSGP after their uneventful male bonding excursions. Shortly thereafter, the Yung Pope reads the fuck out of Gutierrez as nuns play volleyball nearby. \""I know you\'re an alcoholic, and I know you look like a very cute cartoon man.\"" At dinner, the Yung Pope asks Diane Keaton why he hasn\'t seen his parents again. OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.<br />The Yung Pope and Voiello are taking a walk while the Yung Pope utterly destroys Voiello. \""You thought you\'d blackmail me? The Young Pope? I am the Young Pope. Not the Old Pope. Did you get it twisted and think, Oh, he\'s an old pope, when actually, I am the Young Pope?\"" Voiello is like, \""No, I know you\'re Young, forgive me, you are so young!!!!\""<br />The Yung Pope is getting dressed. As is tradition, LMFAO\'s \""Sexy and I Know It\"" plays sweetly in the background. The Yung Pope loves LMFAO because he relates to the family dysfunction that stretched and eventually broke the bond between uncle-and-nephew duo Redfoo and Sky Blu. To him, LMFAO is but another example of the insecurity of human bonds. He dresses to it to remind himself to abstain from human contact, no matter how seductive it may be to found an EDM duo with one\'s relatives. <br />\""Knock, knock!\"" says the Yung Pope. \""Who\'s there? Our deeply horrifying history of intolerance and pain, coming back with a vengeance. Liking gay people? LOL. Being cool to women? Fuck that shit. We are cement without windows. We are the inside of the trunk of a car. We are all the way zipped up in a Juicy suit, even over our heads, so we can\'t breathe, but we still look very good. No negotiating. No compromising. No dancing to LMFAO, except me. We must go back to being prohibitive monsters. In case this wasn\'t clear, from this day forth, we will be the actual worst. Also, hell is real, and I built it. Oh, also, kiss my shoe. K, great.\"" <br />The Yung Pope impregnates Esther via his mind. Shortly thereafter, he stalks and threatens Tonino, the shepherd who believed his magical sheep could fix muscle problems. A pope who can make a kangaroo jump, a flower bloom, a uterus desterilize, a shepherd quake in his booties? A pope who loves LMFAO and tiaras but hates gay people? Who else could it be but<br />Now we\'re on Episode 6. Please keep up. Edgar the cardinal has died in his porridge. Nobody is concerned. Also, there are people praying in Alaska. Please keep up.<br />Voiello is talking about banking and the general crumbling of Catholicism. The Yung Pope\'s eyes are closed, as usual. What\'s behind those eyelids, Yung Pope? \""Your Holiness,\"" he says. \""Who are you really?\"" I\'m so glad you asked, Voiello. He is<br />Nighttime at the Vatican. LSGP is having an orgy in a gritty barn-type environment. The Yung Pope is sitting before the cardinals in his pope tiara, frightening everyone. Esther is giving birth, which means that either nine months have passed or her baby is a malevolent demon. Hard to say for sure. <br />LSGP is bidding adieu to his threesome partners in church. \""I must go to Rome, where I will no longer be able to fuck the most attractive people on this show, save for, of course, the Yung Pope and his hippie parents.\"" He admits that he was afraid, so he didn\'t push his Honduran flock to stop hanging out with murderous drug dealers as hard as he should have. Is this LSGP\'s way of saying he agrees with the Yung Pope\'s maniacal style of pope-ing?<br />Gutierrez is leaving for New York. Oh god I am so afraid for our smushy little Gutierrez. He is almost pancaked by a car immediately. Meanwhile, across town, the Yung Pope is visiting Esther, whom he implanted with a child nine months or one day ago. He gifts her with a Bible, gently shades Thomas Jefferson, then picks up her baby and smells him like a rack of ribs. <br />Not content to let a moment go by without experiencing self-pity, the Yung Pope says, \""I remember what my parents smelled like.\"" Everyone is like \"".....\"" Then he drops the baby.<br />The Yung Pope is meeting with the Italian prime minister, who has been warned that the pope is \""diabolical.\"" The prime minister generously clarifies that, yes, it has been nine months since we last Poped, and Esther\'s baby is not a demon. The Yung Pope hands him a list of requests: \""Give all your money to the Catholic Church. No gay marriage. No abortion. No divorce. No euthanasia. No Muslim or Hindu religious freedom. No cookies for breakfast. Not even Cookie Crisp. Don\'t. I said not even that. Also, I am going to help God extinguish everyone who votes for you at the next election. Also also, I am so fuckin\' hot that it\'s going to work. Oh, and you\'re too young.\""<br />The Yung Pope and Voiello are having passive-aggressive relations as they watch the PM on TV. \""BTW,\"" says the Yung Pope, \""I\'m gonna forbid you from forgiving women who\'ve had abortions.\"" <br />The Yung Pope and his LSGP are having a tense breakfast. The Yung Pope wants to get all the gay priests the hell out of the Vatican, and LSGP is like, \""Uh, well, hm, no.\"" The Yung Pope launches into a monologue about cheese. Just kidding, it\'s about his fucking parents. \""You owe me, because I ditched my parents, who ditched me, for you,\"" he tells LSGP. LSGP takes this lazy-ass bait and begins dismissing all of the cute priests immediately. Elsewhere, in the Yung Pope\'s memory, a Young Diane Keaton sexily plays basketball with herself.<br />The monks want the Yung Pope to resign. They threaten a schism. \""Are you ready to sleep on the ground like junkies, or nah?\"" asks the Yung Pope. \""Also, buy shoes.\"" <br />Voiello is having a non-cane-sugar-themed meeting with the Captain of Police. The captain is like, \""Do you know Tonino? The guy you threatened to throw in quicksand?\"" Voiello is like, \""Nope never heard of him oh wait yes that guy hm nope never threatened to throw him in quicksand.\"" The captain clarifies that Tonino has disappeared, and also, the Vatican has called him approximately one million times. <br />LSGP is, apparently, some sort of gigolo for heterosexual couples. LSGP!!! I didn\'t know you had it in you, my man! Unfortunately, and somewhat ironically, he is also the enemy of all of the cute priests now. One of them, a cute, non-gay manual laborer would-be priest with a simple dream to serve God, shows up to his table at dinner and throws wine in his face. LSGP tells Diane Keaton he wants to go home, to the land of fucking his constituents and not destroying lives. Diane Keaton explains to LSGP that she, too, is an orphan, but she won\'t ever tell the Yung Pope, because she doesn\'t want to \""interfere with his sorrow.\"" Can u not be such a Yung Pope enabler, Diane? <br />[This post has been modified to correct the LMFAO song.]",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNF_iyuGZ3mkRuY-ZQLC_u6V01UBUQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779368683417&ei=A4CVWIB9xPparOaS4A8&url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2979236/the-young-pope-episodes-5-and-6-the-lmfao-pope/,EN,,04/02/2017 08:04,2017-02-03 20:40:47+00:00,6df579530d,MTV.com,,,,,1486158047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You\'re doing a lot better now this time, aren\'t you?\"" Rucker asked. <br />Channel 9 is protecting the boy\'s identity, because he was a victim in the Union County child abuse case that made national headlines.<br />Rucker found the boy handcuffed to a porch with that dead chicken around his neck three years ago.<br />WARNING DISTURBING IMAGES: Photos released in Union Co. child abuse case[1]<br />The boy is now 14 years old and earning A\'s and B\'s in school.<br />\""Thank you for saving my life.

She said she wrongfully lost custody of him years earlier.<br />\""You really honestly saved his life. If you wouldn\'t have decided to walk up there, I don\'t know where he would be. Thank you so much,\"" the boy\'s mother said to Rucker.<br />Back at the old house, it\'s clear this is no longer the same boy who was rescued that day in 2013. Counseling and a stable home have given him new life.<br />\""I didn\'t want to be there anymore. I was just grateful and thankful for it,\"" the boy said.<br />Harper remains in prison and won\'t be eligible for parole until 2021.

If it\'s better now,\"" the boy said.<br />It\'s almost as if the boy at the center of Union County\'s infamous child abuse case is transported back in time to when he was last here three years ago.<br />He sees some old toys in the garage. He climbs abandoned chicken pens without a care in the world.<br />The new owner of the home allowed the boy and his mother inside. The house is being fully renovated.<br />If only it was that easy to erase the boy\'s dark memories of what happened at that house in 2013.<br />\""This is also where they locked the door,\"" the boy told Channel 9 while looking around the house.<br />The boy said the abuse was at its worst inside.<br />His face was cut with a knife, his arm was cut with a needle, and salt was poured in the wound. He was burnt with an electrical wire, and he was handcuffed or chained to objects, like railroad ties, in the house.<br />Most notably, he was found with a dead chicken tied around his neck.<br />Both Harper and Larson pleaded guilty to multiple child abuse charges while caring for the boy and four other children in their foster home.<br />The boy told Boyd that \""Wanda Sue\"" was more abusive towards him and that he wants her to go back to jail.<br />But on this day, his biological mom focused on helping her son find some closure.<br />\""You look at this room, and you see this is the past and know you\'re never going to be in this again,\"" the mom explained to her son while comforting him.<br />His mother said a long road to recovery remains, but life gets a little better every day.<br />Boyd went on WBT Radio Thursday morning to talk about how this emotional story came together.

017ffa5b46,Unhealthy Hooves Can Cost You Money - Lancaster Farming,"Unhealthy Hooves Can Cost You Money | Northern Edition<br />NEWARK, N.Y. - Limping cows? It\'s going to cost you.\""The cost of a lame cow is $370 per cow per episode,\"" according to Vic Daniels, a member of the Hoof Trimmer\'s Association, who spoke at a recent Hoof Health Solutions workshop. \""Your eyes are so important to save your farm money.\""The workshop was held April 21-22 at El-Vi Farms. About two-dozen people attended the workshops, most of whom trim hooves or work in dairy in some other capacity.Fellow Hoof Trimmer\'s Association member Chip Hendrickson said that for a dairy experiencing 20 to 30 percent lameness, \""it becomes very costly.\""One handout provided to participants depicted the stages of lameness from 1 - normal - to 5 - severely lame.\""Everyone can tell stages 4 to 5,\"" Hendrickson said. \""We want to pick them out at 2 to 3.\""By diagnosing lame cows early, producers stand a better chance of preventing the animals\' condition from worsening by trimming and monitoring their hooves.\""A good walking cow has a straight line,\"" Hendrickson said, pointing to a cow\'s back in an illustration. \""When it starts to get a little lame, it has a curve. As they get more lame, the head starts moving when it walks.\""Though he acknowledged that finding time to examine cows may challenge many farmers, careful observation can help prevent severe lameness.Daniels said that understanding bovine anatomy leads to identifying early stages of lameness, comparing the human arm to a cow\'s anatomy for their similarities in movement and structure.He said that 90 percent of lameness issues manifest in the hind legs and 10 percent in the front. But front lameness causes severe pain.\""A cow with a sore front foot crosses her legs to get away from pain,\"" he said, \""but the weight is on the inside. There\'s no escape from pain. At the back of the cow, they can cheat and favor a sore hoof. The outer claws are the pain claws, where they feel it. That\'s why they turn the hooves outward to relieve pain.\""Digital dermatitis and ulcers are the main causes of hoof pain. Daniels said dairymen should look for purple spots that appear in the same place on the heel bone.Regular trimming can help prevent many sources of lameness. Some farms trim every four months and others every six months.\""Your most important job is to learn how to protect cows between trimmer visits,\"" he said.If cows walk too far, walk on rough surfaces or must habitually make tight turns, white line disease can develop in the hooves.\""This should heal, if treated,\"" Hendrickson said.Using recycled material may worsen white line disease as it may be coarse under hooves. Recycled solids used as bedding can be slippery, which can stress hooves.Making surfaces comfortable and walking distances shorter can spare the hooves some stress, Hendrickson said.\""We have to think of how far cows have to travel,\"" he said. \""How can we put cows closer?\""His question underscored the importance of careful layout when planning dairy buildings and processes. Rubber mats can help decrease pressure on hooves, too.\""Anyone who works in a dairy should have a pen and piece of paper on him at all times to write down the lame cows\' numbers and later take care of it,\"" Hendrickson said.Deborah Jeanne Sergeant is a freelance writer in central New York.

018e1d4e7f,Fitzgerald: The Delta\'s \'armageddon critter\' arrives - Stockton Record,"Fitzgerald: The Delta\'s \'armageddon critter\' arrives - News - recordnet.com<br />Michael Fitzgerald Record columnist @Stocktonopolis<br />Crank up the war machine: Nutria have reached the Delta.Myocastor coypus, a rapidly breeding, super-destructive Argentinean swamp rat that grows as big as a medium-sized dog, was found days ago on Roberts Island.\""This discovery throws us for a loop,\"" said Peter Tira, a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.That\'s because the northernmost detection of this invasive, semi-aquatic, 20-pound rodent had been Stanislaus County. DFW was concentrating eradication efforts further south. The idea was to head the nutria off from reaching the Delta.Swamp rat 1, DFW 0. Go, defense!Some may shrug. The Delta\'s full of invasive species, so what\'s another? Tira counters that nutria pose a grave threat.\""There are invasive species, and then there are nutria,\"" Tira said. \""They\'re the triple threat, we call \'em, in terms of invasive species.\""Because Nutria eat aquatic roots, and crops, and they burrow into levees.As for aquatic plants, nutria destroy far more than they eat, tearing plants out with forepaws as they stuff their faces with one-quarter of their body weight a day.Without roots to bind soil, wetlands dissolve into open water. Yet wetlands are key to native Delta species, some of which are endangered or threatened.Not to mention crops. The mainstay of San Joaquin\'s economy. Cattle, too, may be harmed by parasites that nutria poop into water. Humans, too.Nutria resemble beaver - except for round, ratlike tails and vivid, almost glowing orange front teeth (who has orange teeth?) but instead of building dens, they bore into levees.To top it off, a mama nutria gives birth two or three times a year, up to 13 young per litter. The young soon breed. Nutria multiply exponentially.And the Delta has none of their natural Argentine predators: the cayman, the jaguar. Nor does it have cold weather that retards their spread elsewhere.Faced with this crisis, \""Our goal is complete eradication in California,\"" Tira said.DFW has divided the state into 40 grids and created GIS maps of detections and other data. Oops, the nutria migrated northward off the grid.And not to the \""edge of the Delta\"" as reported elsewhere. Roberts Island is in the \""legal Delta,\"" the core within the secondary zone.DFR is training a dozen wildlife biologists for battle. They are planting waterproof cameras around the Delta and baiting traps with sweet potatoes. Other agencies are joining the fight.The plan calls for more cameras, more traps, presumably a bigger grid and perhaps scent-trained dogs.But not bounty hunting. Nutria look too much like beavers or muskrats. Officials fear hunters will blast native animals.The good news: \""We believe we\'re in the early phase\"" of infestation, Tira said. The bad news: Given the nutria\'s rapid population growth, the battle may be won or lost in the early phase.State Sen. Cathleen Galgiani, D-Stockton, wants to hold hearings \""to find out the extent of the problem, who\'s doing what and what more can be done,\"" said Robin Adam, a senior consultant to the senator.\""Cathleen is extremely concerned about this,\"" Adam added.One wonders, can government ward off the nutria?\""We\'re marshaling every resource we can,\"" Tira said. \""We have some of our best and brightest on this project.\""Restore the Delta\'s Barbara Barrigan-Parilla said she fears that the state may exploit the nutria problem to advance its Delta tunnels agenda.\""If they can show there are problems with levees from nutria burrowing into levees then there\'s a case that the state can make for the project,\"" Barrigan-Parilla said. \""That\'s what terrifies me.\""Granted, there\'s something almost ridiculous about being menaced by a giant swamp rat. Bill Jennings of the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance saw the humor in it.\""The Delta has a long history of invasion by rats,\"" he said, \""from the Bureau of Reclamation to the DWR (Department of Water Resources) to the Metropolitan Water District. I would put it into a lesser category than those. But it\'s still a big rat.\""It\'s a big rat which will rapidly become the bane of the Delta - an ineradicable, six-figure infestation, a pestilence to Ag, a blow to the economy, a threat to state water conveyance and even to public safety (think levee breaks) - unless authorities urgently mobilize.No kidding.\""It\'s touch and go,\"" said Tira. \""We really believe California\'s future as we imagine it is at stake here.\""Contact columnist Michael Fitzgerald at (209) 546-8270 or michaelf@recordnet.com.

01981be3e7,"Whipped, kicked, beaten: Illinois workers describe abuse of hogs - Chicago Tribune","Whipped, kicked, beaten: Illinois workers describe abuse of hogs<br />Weeks after taking a job as a breeding technician at Eagle Point Farms, an anguished Sharee Santorineos sat down and wrote a three-page whistleblower complaint.\""I seen pigs that are pregnant beat with steel bars,\"" said her letter to the Illinois Bureau of Animal Health and Welfare. \""I seen them kicked all over their body.\""<br />Santorineos knows about raising animals. At a friend\'s rural Illinois farmhouse, she grows pigs and poultry that they eventually will have slaughtered. <br />Still, what she saw at the western Illinois confinement appalled her, and she hoped her December 2015 letter would prompt a thorough state investigation.<br />Instead, like other worker allegations about animal abuse in Illinois\' 900-plus hog confinement facilities, Santorineos\' account went nowhere.After Eagle Point executives gave a state bureau inspector a guided tour of the 6,000-pig operation, he wrote a single-page report.\""I did not observe anyone mistreating the animals,\"" it said. \""No violations found. Docket is closed.\""The state has regularly discounted or dismissed such worker complaints, a Tribune investigation has found. In the Illinois hog confinements that send 12 million pigs to market annually, the bureau did not find a single animal welfare infraction or violation during the past five years, the Tribune found in reviewing thousands of pages of bureau records.<br />A lack of inspectors - the bureau has just six - contributes to the scant enforcement, while weak Illinois and federal livestock protection laws do little to safeguard animals. <br />Questions about how the pigs, cows and poultry we eat are treated - what the animals are fed, how they are medicated and how they live and die - are putting new pressures on a U.S. livestock industry that until recently has focused almost exclusively on productivity and profit.Animal rights activists have lifted the welfare of livestock into the public consciousness by taking jobs in hog confinements and secretly recording pigs being pummeled, dragged with hooks and pinned for life in crates. But Illinois law makes it a potential felony to record a conversation without the consent of all parties, and no undercover stings have emerged from the state. Using worker compensation claims, court records and animal abuse reports filed with the state Agriculture Department, Tribune reporters for the first time pieced together a disturbing portrait of abusive treatment in pig confinements here amid lax scrutiny from the state. In on-the-record interviews, Santorineos and more than a dozen other Illinois swine-confinement workers told the Tribune they witnessed fellow employees whip pigs with metal rods and gouge them with pliers and ballpoint pens to hurry the animals from one stall to the next or onto the trucks that took them to slaughter. They described employees abusing pigs for amusement and encouraging colleagues to take out their frustrations on the animals.Worker accounts of cruelty and torture arose in hog confinements across the state run by market-leading firms.Some workers said their supervisors meted out punishment to speed up lame or unwilling pigs. \""He\'d kick them,\"" said Kelley Shannon, a former employee of a Professional Swine Management confinement in western Illinois. \""I\'m talking, full-bore kick. Bloody its nose and punch a pig so hard it damn near popped its eye out.\"" Pork industry representatives and Professional Swine executives told the Tribune they do not tolerate mistreatment and increasingly are taking proactive steps, including internal hotlines for workers to report problems. Facility operators also cautioned that former workers can be biased. They are likely to embellish, industry representatives said, because they are angry at their bosses, upset about their experiences or simply trying to impress journalists.When the state receives an allegation of abuse, it is the job of an obscure and understaffed bureau in the Illinois Department of Agriculture to investigate.The six inspectors in the Bureau of Animal Health and Welfare, down from 12 in 2005, must handle complaints about not just the mistreatment of livestock but also dead goldfish in dirty pet store tanks, dogs in kennel cages and filth in petting zoos.The number of animal welfare violations the bureau issued across all of these settings fell from 200 in 2005 to 29 last year, while referrals for prosecution dropped during that period from 22 per year to just one, state records show. When the bureau fielded a 2013 whistleblower allegation that employees were hitting pigs with metal bars at the Win Production LLC hog confinement in Scott County, a state inspector\'s investigation consisted largely of a few phone calls. In his report, he wrote that he spoke with a facility manager whose name was listed only as \""Betty\"" and an owner \""whose name eludes me at this time.\""In that phone call, facility executives denied the allegation. The veterinarian at the facility, Alan Wildt, sent the inspector a short email stating he had visited the farm monthly for years and had \""never witnessed any production practices that could be considered abusive.\""On the basis of that email and the phone calls, the inspector reported: \""There is no proof the (abuse) claim can be verified so the docket is closed.\""Illinois state veterinarian Mark Ernst, who oversees the animal welfare bureau, said his inspectors do not have police powers and typically do not question fellow workers who might corroborate a whistleblower\'s account.\""Our investigations are handled a little differently than what you would think of as a criminal investigation,\"" Ernst said. \""The primary goal is to try and get compliance and to educate those people so they don\'t make the same mistake.\""A lot of pressureSmart, strong-willed and muscular, pigs can be frustrating to handle even when raised on pastures or small family farms. Still, Illinois\' massive, modern-day confinements create new pressures that contribute to animal abuse. Pig handlers deal with hundreds or thousands of animals at a time. Animals bred for their lean meat can be aggressive and resistant to handling, and some facilities use feed additives that promote hog growth but also can stimulate hyperactivity and belligerent behavior. For immigrant workers, a language barrier can impede communication about acceptable handling practices.\""A lot of things have come together that put workers and animals under a lot of pressure,\"" said Emily Patterson-Kane, a top animal welfare scientist with the American Veterinary Medical Association and a former \""pigger\"" in Scotland.<br />Some workers told the Tribune their colleagues often abused pigs when hustling the animals from pen to pen or onto slaughter trucks. Hog confinement workers are trained to walk behind groups of animals, usually shaking \""rattle paddles\"" to make a sharp noise that repels pigs. But the leader can\'t be guided that way if workers are trying to move more than a handful of pigs, meat industry consultant Temple Grandin told the Tribune.<br />\""The No. 1 mistake that people make is trying to move too many market pigs at a time,\"" said Grandin, a professor at Colorado State University.In those situations, workers said, it becomes tempting to abuse the pigs to make them move. Terry Clement, a former employee at a downstate Christensen Farms facility, said young female pigs, called gilts, would often freeze as they were moved into the area where they were to be isolated in metal cages known as gestation crates.\""I\'ve seen a lot of guys beat on the gilts,\"" Clement said. \""I\'ve seen their backs. Big long scratches that bleed.\""He added: \""I seen pregnant sows being beat on with the rattle paddles. I\'ve seen them scratched on the back with pens. We had fiberglass sort boards - you\'d catch them hitting the hogs with those.\""When a supervisor walked the floor, \""you had to go by the book,\"" Clement said. \""But when he wasn\'t there, everybody just wanted to hurry up and go home.\"" <br />Christensen Farms CEO Glenn Stolt did not challenge the Tribune accounts of abuse from Clement or other former company workers, calling them \""troubling,\"" but said his firm has significantly strengthened its protections for the animals by bolstering training, implementing an anonymous employee hotline and conducting unannounced audits. In a costly pilot program, the company in May installed video monitors inside one facility.With 113 workers in its Illinois hog confinements, Christensen Farms last year had nine internal reports of animal abuse across the state, company officials said. The company deemed two instances to be \""willful\"" and terminated both employees. One admitted kicking a sow, and the other let baby piglets go hungry rather than train a new employee how to feed them.\""My expectation is that it\'s zero, and that\'s the expectation we communicate all the time,\"" Stolt said. \""There is no place for any animal abuse.\""Ernst, the state veterinarian, said he couldn\'t estimate how often pigs are abused in Illinois confinements.\""You\'ve got to keep in mind, any good producer, this is their livelihood. It\'s how they feed their families and put their kids through school. And obviously if they don\'t have healthy and happy animals, it\'s going to be very difficult for them to make a living. The very good ones, I think they\'re right on top of it, and like anything else, you also have the other end of the spectrum.\""Still, some executives told the Tribune they rarely enter their facilities, leaving to line workers the difficult job of handling the pigs day to day.Facilities often pay little more than minimum wage and use the agricultural exemption from overtime laws. Confinement workers described bruising attacks from frantic pigs, as well as headaches and persistent respiratory ailments caused by animal dander and gases from the waste storage pits below.\""I wouldn\'t recommend anyone to do that job,\"" said Jacob Allen, whose eight-month term at a southern Illinois facility run by The Maschhoffs LLC ended when a charging 250-pound pig shoved him into a gate, according to Allen\'s claim with the Illinois Workers\' Compensation Commission and a Tribune interview.But in his economically challenged part of the state, Allen said, \""there\'s not much else, so you take what you can get.\"" Grandin, who has worked in the field for decades, recalled how commonplace abuse was in \""the bad old days of the \'80s and early \'90s.\""Back then, Grandin estimated, \""20 percent of the people did a good job of handling pigs.\""Today that percentage is much higher, she said. But when facilities are understaffed or employees have to perform repetitive tasks for hours - such as vaccinating, impregnating, castrating or moving hundreds of pigs - \""workers get tired, they get frustrated and impatient. It\'s very difficult to care,\"" she said.\""I\'ve been around for a long time and there\'s some people that - they enjoy hurting animals and they should not be there.\""\'We hit \'em hard\'Even at facilities run by a company that champions animal welfare, the Tribune found allegations of mistreatment.The Maschhoffs, the nation\'s third-largest pork producer, was one of the first large companies to create a top-level animal welfare division eight years ago, and workers said their barn bosses did not tolerate mistreatment. \""Maschhoffs wouldn\'t even let you use a clothespin (to prod a pig). They\'d fire you on the spot,\"" said Randall Hall, who worked until 2012 at one company complex.But when supervisors weren\'t around, \""workers beat the pigs with paddles, with hoses, boards and metal rods,\"" said Raymond Hamilton, who worked until last year at a facility in downstate Carlyle.\""The pigs got beat up so bad they don\'t move,\"" Hamilton said.When a pig buckled under that kind of abuse, employees euthanized the animal with a shot between the eyes from a livestock bolt gun, workers said.\""I\'ve seen one guy actually shoot one because he done stressed it out too bad. He\'s like, \'Oh we got to kill this,\'\"" said former Maschhoffs worker Joshua Owens.\""Some of the employees, it was fun to them to be mean to an animal,\"" Owens said. \""When the bigwigs came, they straightened up.\""Maschhoffs President Bradley Wolter said he was outraged to hear allegations of abuse from a Tribune reporter.\""I am just appalled by it. It goes against everything I believe in and we believe in as a company,\"" Wolter said. \""We\'re in the practice of pig production and there is a nobility to it. These animals trust us to take care of them. We don\'t think there is anybody else on the planet that cares more about these animals than we do.\""Wolter said employees make about 70 to 100 calls per year to the company\'s internal animal abuse hotline, and since 2015 Maschhoffs has terminated seven of its 1,300 workers nationwide after finding evidence of abuse, neglect or mistreatment of a pig. The firm recently alerted government authorities to an abuse allegation at one facility that is not in Illinois, Wolter said, although he provided no further details.<br />\""Do I believe we have individuals that lose their temper and harm an animal? The data says it happens. We\'ve terminated those people. It disgusts me,\"" Wolter said. One Illinois worker discharged by Maschhoffs, Michael Cavins, told the Tribune he frequently witnessed co-workers abuse pigs to get them to move - and soon took part in the violence.<br />\""Yes, that happened. We hit \'em hard with the paddles to get \'em to move,\"" Cavins said. \""That was one of the reasons I was discharged.\""Cavins told the Tribune he had worked with pigs for more than a decade and Maschhoffs had retrained him on how to move animals without harming them. Yet he joined other workers who aggressively moved the sows, until a supervisor spotted him.\""I wish I\'d went by the book and not even done it,\"" Cavins said. \""I just hit \'em too hard. It\'s going on all the time; they\'re constantly being hit when the supervisors aren\'t around.\""\'It doesn\'t look pretty\'Deliberate torture of farm animals can be a crime in Illinois, but only veterinarians are mandated to report it - not facility workers, supervisors or operators. Many Illinois confinement veterinarians visit the facilities only once or twice a month, and none has reported abuse in the facilities since 2011, the Tribune found. No companies have reported incidents to the state bureau during that time.Illinois also is among the 38 states where long-standing farm practices are exempted from animal cruelty laws. These include castrating piglets and clipping their tails, teeth and ears without pain relief, as well as confining breeding sows in tight gestation and farrowing crates.\""Normal husbandry practices means anything farmers have done in the past, even if they are extremely cruel,\"" said Joan Schaffner, a George Washington University Law School associate professor. \""If you were to do the same thing to your dog or cat, it would clearly be criminal.\""Another example of practices that livestock handlers accept but consumers find deeply disturbing is the way piglets are euthanized. Breeding facilities like Eagle Point cull deformed and underweight piglets because high-speed slaughterhouses require uniformity in animal weight and size, so that their processing machines and line workers can quickly make repetitive motions that pull the carcasses apart.Illinois confinement workers often are trained to euthanize the runts and sick animals by grabbing their back legs and smashing the animals\' heads into the concrete floor or metal crates. If done correctly, veterinary experts say, this head blow destroys a piglet\'s brain and causes no pain.State veterinarian Ernst said of the practice: \""It doesn\'t look pretty, but it is instantaneous and humane.\""Ernst added that the head smashing can be emotionally difficult for workers who took jobs in livestock confinements because they wanted to care for animals. \""That is a challenge, getting people trained up to do these duties.\""It was certainly a problem for Santorineos, who refused to kill pigs and recoiled at the actions of her co-workers.Some workers who failed at killing a piglet on the first try would frequently toss it aside and leave it to die, she and other Illinois confinement employees told the Tribune. The workers also described stressed colleagues whipping piglets against the floor out of anger and frustration.Santorineos told the Tribune that the youngest Eagle Point workers would bet on how many hits it would take to put out a piglet. The American Veterinary Medical Association says \""blunt force trauma\"" can be a merciful way to kill piglets less than 3 weeks old. But the association\'s most recent guidelines recommend that producers consider alternatives ranging from a bolt gun to small carbon dioxide chambers, electrocution and barbiturate overdose supervised by a veterinarian.Some companies are already making changes. Starting in September, Maschhoffs will exclusively use carbon dioxide chambers to euthanize piglets, company officials said.And U.S. pork retailer Tyson now discourages the head-smashing technique. The company in 2014 issued a letter telling pig suppliers the practice \""had been historically acceptable\"" but did not meet the expectations of consumers.Bill Hollis, a partner with Professional Swine Management, the Carthage, Ill.-based company that manages Eagle Point and 26 other confinements in Illinois, Iowa and Missouri, said he was unaware of the Tyson advisory.Santorineos said she was threatened with termination for refusing to euthanize piglets at Eagle Point and then fired for wearing street clothes in a restricted area. Days later, she filed her abuse allegations with the state.While she was employed she sent notes to her confinement supervisor detailing injuries to pigs, but nothing came of it, she said. \""The farm boss ... told me not to worry about it,\"" Santorineos wrote in her complaint to the state.\""The sows get beat when they are trying to move them from the big barn to the farrowing room,\"" she told the Tribune. \""Their legs give out. They walk real slow. (Workers) take the rods that hold the cages closed and beat \'em and kick \'em.\""Regarding Santorineos\' allegations, Hollis said he concluded that \""there was no animal abuse or mistreatment.\"" Still, the firm held a retraining session for Eagle Point employees.Professional Swine is managed by veterinarians but does not contact the state bureau when abuse allegations surface, company officials said. Instead it conducts internal investigations. The firm says it has dismissed four employees so far this year for mistreatment and animal welfare infractions at its facilities.At Tyson\'s behest, Eagle Point went through a scheduled, four-hour-long animal welfare audit in July 2015. The third-party inspection reported \""no willful acts of abuse observed\"" on that morning.A former co-worker of Santorineos\', Beverly Hopping, told the Tribune that she also complained fruitlessly to her supervisor about animal abuse. \""They did nothing about it. I went to them many times,\"" Hopping said.\""There was a guy who was really mean to the hogs,\"" she said. \""He would leave deep scrapes on them. Some of them would be bleeding.\""When piglets had a rupture following a botched castration, \""they just take them by the back legs and smash them on the ground,\"" Hopping said. \""Sometimes they wouldn\'t die immediately. They kept kicking and twitching. They told us that is part of our jobs.

d12e8b1c74,Children continue to die from vaccine-preventable diseases. We can stop that - The Guardian,"Children continue to die from vaccine-preventable diseases. We can stop that | Amy Belisle | Opinion<br />As a pediatrician, I have been profoundly affected by watching children suffer and die because of vaccine-preventable diseases. Over the last 15 years, I have watched a healthy teenager lose his life in 48 hours to meningococcemia despite heroic efforts to save him. I\'ve seen a toddler lose his hearing after suffering from a spinal infection that could have been prevented with an Haemophilus influenza vaccine. I\'ve seen kids with chicken pox get pneumonia and joint infections.<br />It\'s heartbreaking to tell a family that their child died or is suffering from a disease for which we have vaccinations. But here in Maine, that could happen more often. Recently there has been a spike in chicken pox and pertussis (whooping cough) cases likely related to the increased number of families who are opting out of immunization.<br />Last year, Maine\'s vaccination exemption rate for kindergartners rose[1] to 5.2%. \""Herd immunity\"" for communities is at risk when the immunization rate falls below 95%. In 2014, Maine\'s vaccination opt-out rate was the fifth[2] highest[3] in the United States. The rate of philosophical exemption looks even more stark when we see the wide variations across communities in the state: the Portland Press Herald reported[4] that, in at least 39 primary schools, both public and private, 80% or fewer students are getting the measles shot. Only 37.5% of children at one kindergarten at a public charter school in Gray received the vaccination.<br />My kids have two working parents, so I am always first in line to get our four kids vaccinated. I have limited paid time off to care for our kids when they are sick, and I rely on other children in our daycare and schools to be vaccinated to ensure that the kids in our community are healthy. Some may argue that the symptoms of these diseases are harmless. Due to effective vaccinations programs in the United States, we rarely see the terrible implications of infections like polio, where images of children in iron lungs once proliferated. So it\'s easy to forget that a choice not to vaccinate poses a significant risk to our youngest children, our grandparents and children attending school with illnesses such as cancer who cannot be vaccinated and have a compromised immune system.<br />There are another 70,000 moms like me in our state, and 30,000 more women[5] who are single parents. Other people\'s unvaccinated kids don\'t just put my kids at risk for illness; they put many women in Maine and across the country in the economically precarious position of having sick children and, in some cases, no way to care for them without losing out on income. In 2010, the Maine Primary Care Association estimated[6] that every dollar spent on vaccines saves $6.30 in direct medical costs and up to $18.40 in indirect costs to families and communities. It is interesting to note that in Washington County, the county with the highest rate of children living in poverty in Maine, we also see the highest immunization rates[7] in the state.<br />As the director of Child Health Quality Improvement[8] at Maine Quality Counts, my colleagues and I recently worked with 24 practices and 90 physicians to help them improve their immunization practices and better communicate with families about the importance of vaccines as part of the Improving Health Outcomes for Children[9] Project. We worked[10] on reducing missed opportunities for vaccines when kids came to the office, contacting families due or overdue for vaccines and developing educational materials for families. We also worked with the staff at the state immunization registry so that practices could get reports to identify patients who were not up to date. The Muskie School of Public Service at the University of Southern Maine reports[11] that the project showed an 11.1% increase in immunization rates in those practices over 26 months. That\'s 6,000 additional Maine children vaccinated.<br />The truth is no child need suffer from chicken pox or any other vaccine-preventable disease. Childhood vaccines are available for free in Maine, thanks to a Universal Vaccine Coverage Law passed by its legislature in 2010. The only barrier is misinformation and the fear that it breeds.<br />References^ rose (www.pressherald.com)^ fifth (www.pressherald.com)^ highest (www.pressherald.com)^ reported (www.pressherald.com)^ another 70,000 moms like me in our state, and 30,000 more women (www.naccrra.org)^ estimated (www1.maine.gov)^ highest immunization rates (www1.maine.gov)^ Child Health Quality Improvement (www.mainequalitycounts.org)^ Improving Health Outcomes for Children (www.maine.gov)^ worked (www.mainequalitycounts.org)^ reports (www.mainequalitycounts.org)<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH79QdNvb11HFuznFPmepPkOLW17Q&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52778865881748&ei=you8VvCtKoHBasCUqaAO&url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/04/children-die-vaccine-preventable-diseases-we-can-stop-that,EN,,11/02/2016 13:26,2015-06-04 12:45:21+00:00,8f26df012d,The Guardian,,,,,1433429121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d133a2cdee,Is That Weed Poisonous? What You Don\'t Want Your Cattle to Eat - Drovers Magazine,"Is That Weed Poisonous? What You Don\'t Want Your Cattle to Eat<br />While Johnsongrass is a good quality forage, it can be challenging to control in pastures where the perennial, warm-season grass is not desired. Prussic acid production under stress can pose a risk to livestock when grazing Johnsongrass, especially during prolonged droughts or after a frost.<br />( Dirk Philipp, University of Arkansas )<br />Poisonous plants are responsible for considerable losses in livestock although many cases go unrecognized and undiagnosed due to a lack of knowledge of which plants could be responsible and the wide range of symptoms that may result from consumption. The potential for poisoning depends on the availability and quantity of the toxic weed, the stage or maturity of plant growth, weather, and season of the year. Most weeds have an undesirable taste and cattle will not consume them unless they are baled up in hay or pasture is limited due to drought or overgrazing. However, if cattle have access to areas where toxic weeds predominate and little else to consume, the potential exists to eat enough of one particular plant to result in illness or death. Usually large quantities are required to cause problems but some are deadly with just a few mouthfuls. Plant poisoning should be considered a possibility in cattle on pasture with a sudden onset of unexplained symptoms such as diarrhea, salivation or slobbering, muscle weakness, trembling, incoordination, staggering, collapse, severe difficulty breathing or rapid death. Oftentimes plant poisonings only affect a few cattle in the herd and severity of symptoms primarily depends on the amount consumed over what period of time (rate of consumption). Many weeds retain toxicity when dried and are considered dangerous in hay. Seeds can be a potent source of toxin and may inadvertently end up in grains fed to cattle. Prevention of problems begins with learning to recognize poisonous plants; weeds frequently grow in fence rows, along creek or stream banks, near ponds and in the woods although some (such as cocklebur, horsenettle and pigweed) are found in pastures and hayfields. Do not overgraze pastures because animals will usually avoid weeds as long as there is plenty of hay or grass available. It is also important not to harvest toxic weeds in hay or silage since cattle often do not sort through these feeds and leave the weeds uneaten. Ultimately, prevention involves implementing effective weed control and offering supplemental forage or feed when pasture is limited so cattle are not forced to graze toxic weeds. Where it is practical, use management practices to thicken the stand and improve the growth of desirable forages which can compete with the emergence and growth of annual weeds.<br />The chart linked here addresses the major poisonous weeds found in Kentucky pastures along with a few of lesser importance. These weeds were chosen because of their potential for some symptoms to result from consumption and they are relatively common so the risk of exposure is elevated. If available, information on the amount necessary to be toxic in cattle is included. Part II will cover toxic trees and shrubs. This series of articles will not address forage disorders such as grass staggers from mold, fescue toxicosis, slobbers from moldy clover, and will only briefly address nitrate and cyanide poisoning where applicable. UK Extension fact sheets are available on these and other forage disorders at the UK Extension Website http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcomm/pubs.asp under the \""Publications\"" tab or ask the county extension agent for this information. Pictures of many of the weeds and control options are available from the UK Extension publication \""Broadleaf Weeds of KY Pastures\"" at http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcomm/pubs/AGR/AGR207/AGR207.pdf and more in-depth information regarding weed control may be found in the Extension publication entitled \""Weed Management in Grass Pastures, Hayfields, and Other Farmstead Sites\"" at http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcomm/pubs/agr/agr172/agr172.pdf<br />For help identifying weeds, individuals can submit unknown weed samples through the local county extension office. For plants that the local ANR agents are unable to identify, he or she will forward them on to the UK Weed Science Herbarium. Collect as much of plant as possible (roots, leaves, stems, flowers, etc.) for submission to the county extension agency.<br />Perilla mint has a distinctive mint aroma, dark green to purplish square stems and serrated leaves with a purple tint. Mature plants reach 2-3 feet tall and produce small, white to purple flowers with abundant seeds. Picture accessed from:http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/poison/plants/ppperil.htm<br />Two common weeds in Kentucky causing problems in livestock are perilla mint and poison hemlock. A severe type of pneumonia can result from ingestion of the leaves and seeds of perilla mint (Perilla frutescens). This weed is also known as perilla, purple mint, mint weed, beefsteak plant, and wild coleus. Perilla thrives in late summer, when pastures are frequently dry and dormant, and cattle are looking for something to eat.<br />The weed prefers shaded areas along creeks, in fence rows, and the edges of the woods and partially shaded pastures. Once it becomes established, perilla produces many seeds and large colonies can develop in succeeding years.<br />The flowering or seed parts of perilla mint contain the highest concentration of perilla ketone, considered the most toxic agent involved. The perilla ketone is absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the lungs where it damages the lung tissue. Affected animals are frequently found dead. Treatment is of limited value and severe cases seldom survive.<br />Cattle seldom eat poison hemlock unless other forage is limited.<br />Poison hemlock is growing everywhere in Kentucky. Cattle seldom eat poison hemlock but they will if no other forage is available or it is incorporated in hay or silage. Occasionally cattle in total confinement will break into an area with an overgrowth of poison hemlock and graze it down quickly simply because it is green. The toxins involved are conium alkaloids that have two major effects in cattle. A rapid, sometimes fatal effect on the nervous system can occur by ingesting as little as 0.2-0.5% of their body weight in green hemlock. Symptoms of poisoning can develop rapidly, anywhere within 30 minutes to 2 hours after consumption, and begin with slobbering, muscle tremors, and incoordination progressing to respiratory failure and death. Secondly, the alkaloids are teratogenic agents (causing birth defects) in calves if it is eaten by a cow during the first trimester of pregnancy. Fall calving cows are more frequently affected when they ingest young, green hemlock plants in the late winter and deliver calves in the fall with severe birth defects including crooked legs, deformed neck and spine, and cleft palate.<br />Can you identify the weeds below that may be poisonous to livestock?<br />Pictures of White Snakeroot and Pokeweed from https://poisonousplants.ansci.cornell.edu/php/plants.php?action=display&ispecies=cattle and Picture of Johnsongrass from http://extension.msstate.edu/publications/publications/johnsongrass",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHvJ2QftComCJySqMTUJAj5H13INg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=1NvrW4jzOo3QzQb3vqGYDQ&url=https://www.drovers.com/article/weed-poisonous-what-you-dont-want-your-cattle-eat,EN,,14/11/2018 08:23,2018-07-26 16:00:54+00:00,bb82b4c124,Drovers Magazine,,,,,1532628054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d1343a8932,Donald Trump doesn\'t understand what \'sexism\' is - CNN,"Donald Trump doesn\'t understand what \'sexism\' is<br />The latest episode comes in Trump\'s use of the word \""sexism.\"" Trump tweeted over the weekend that Bill Clinton has \""demonstrated a penchant for sexism[1]\"" after Hillary announced Bill would be helping her campaign. Trump\'s various tweets alleging sexism versus Bill bring to mind the famous line from the movie \""Princess Bride.\"" In that classic comedy, Mandy Patinkin\'s character challenged another\'s incorrect use of a word with the statement: \""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\""Now there\'s no disputing that Bill had extramarital relations. But that\'s not in and of itself sexism. The dictionary definition of sexism [2]is generally two fold, either discrimination based on gender or \""behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex.\"" A dictionary definition, however, can only go so far in grasping what a concept such as sexism actually means. Real world examples tend to be a better teaching tool. So let me give you some real life examples of what are undeniably examples of sexism -- all courtesy of Donald J. Trump:-- Trump told[3] a female reporter: \""I mean, we could say politically correct that look doesn\'t matter, but the look obviously matters.\"" Adding, \""Like you wouldn\'t have your job if you weren\'t beautiful.\"" Telling a woman she only got her job because she\'s pretty is about as sexist as you get. -- Trump about fellow GOP presidential candidate[4] Carly Fiorina: \""Carly -- look at that face. Would anybody vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?! I mean, she\'s a woman, and I\'m not s\'posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?\"" Conversely, saying a women isn\'t qualified for a job because she isn\'t pretty enough is again textbook sexism.-- Trump in April tweeted:[5] \""If Hillary Clinton can\'t satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America.\"" Trump blames Hillary for her husband\'s infidelity because apparently to Trump, the wife is required to satisfy her husband and if she doesn\'t, the man will understandably seek satisfaction elsewhere. Behold: Sexism!-- After Fox News\' Megyn Kelly challenged Trump\'s history of sexist remarks by noting that he had called women, \""fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals,\"" Trump went on CNN[6] and attacked Kelly with the statement: \""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes...Blood coming out of her wherever.\"" Trump deserves an award of some sort for this incident -- he responded to charges of being sexist by being even more sexist by claiming that Kelly only asked him challenging questions because she was having her period. Apparently to Trump, female journalists can\'t possibly be good reporters unless it\'s a certain time of the month.And there are so many other examples of Trump\'s sexism over the years documented in articles like[7] \""The nine most sexist Donald Trump quotes\"" and \""18 Real Things Donald Trump Has Actually Said About Women[8].\"" If a sexist hall of fame were ever built, Trump would be in it. (But knowing Trump, he would likely want the hall to be named after him.)Now if cheating on your wife was in fact a sexist act, then Trump has that covered, too. Trump very famously cheated on his wife and the mother of his three children, Ivana, with Marla Maples in 1990. That affair made headlines[9], which reportedly caused Ivana \""to been completely humiliated by Donald through his public association with Marla Maples.\"" Of course, no one is saying that Bill Clinton\'s past infidelities are off limits. But how are they Hillary\'s responsibility?I get the sense that Trump believes that women are defined by their husbands and are not capable of having their own identity apart from that. If that turns out to be Trump\'s point, that would truly be the cherry on Trump\'s sexist sundae.

At a candle-lit vigil he called for harmony between all people at the Chapel of the Apparitions and spoke of wars \""tearing our world apart\"".

The beatification process for her began in 2008.The Church attaches great value to their visions, as Mary is believed to have revealed truths to help mankind. The Church says the first vision came on 13 May 1917.

The first described a terrifying vision of hell, with a \""great sea of fire\"", demons and human souls <br />The second is interpreted as Mary\'s prediction that World War One would end and that World War Two would start during the papacy of Pius XI <br />Mary also called for the \""consecration\"" of Russia, saying: \""If my requests are heeded, Russia will be converted, and there will be peace; if not, she will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church\""<br />Lucia sealed the third secret in an envelope, which was handed to the Vatican in 1957 and only revealed in 2000<br />It described an angel demanding \""penance!\"", then the Pope and other clergy climbing a mountain, only to be killed by soldiers firing bullets and arrows.<br />What does the Vatican say about them?According to Pope Francis\'s predecessor, Benedict XVI,[3] the visions described in the three secrets are \""meant to mobilise the forces of change in the right direction\"".They are not like the Bible - a text he describes as a \""public revelation\"". The Fatima visions are \""private revelations\"", he writes. Their purpose is \""to help live more fully\"" in accordance with Christ\'s teaching.The late Pope John Paul II was shot by a Turkish gunman on 13 May 1981.

Artificial wombs, synthetic blood and electronic skin. Is human body ripe for disruption?, Health News, ET Health. 
World 
Even the decade old smartphone industry may not exist if an electronic tattoo on your wrist or palm could do the job. Shridhar MarriCEO and Co-Founder of Senseforth, Inc.. 
Disruption affects every industry [ 1 ] eventually, and the human body may be next on the list. Nature has done a lot of the evolutionary heavy lifting the old fashioned way -- slowly and randomly. With new technological advances, humans can take control of the process. Genetically engineered humans [ 2 ] are not just the province of science fiction stories with new gene therapies [ 3 ], better mapping and hardware developments. Throughout history, the major focus for healthcare has been to combat diseases. This meant billions of dollars poured into drug research and other methodologies designed to fight disease. Success rates vary, depending on the disease, but humans now possess the capacity to change the shape of the battlefield with a biological revolution [ 4 ]. We know that the agricultural revolution changed the shape of food production. The industrial revolution changed the face of manufacturing. The information revolution is continuing to create change and disruption in virtually every market. The biological revolution has the potential for even greater impact. Thousands of startups will emerge globally to usher in this revolution and spawn new industries. Several traditional industries like Pharma and Healthcare may not survive in their current forms. Even the decade old smartphone industry may not exist if an electronic tattoo on your wrist or palm could do the job. Latest and Greatest Bioscience Advances. 
Emerging technologies have the potential to affect every part of the human body, at virtually every stage. The designer baby debate is still in its infancy, but the technology is real. Artificial Wombs [ 5 ] - Researchers at the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia have successfully developed an artificial womb. Designed to help gestate premature babies to full term, this technology has already been used with lambs. Combine this technology with a nutrient slurry cooked up by researchers at Cambridge University that kept an embryo alive for nearly two weeks and we might have the recipe for live births without pregnancies. Synthetic Blood [ 6 ] - Donated blood saves lives, but aging donor populations and increasingly aging populations means a greater demand than ever. Researchers have been attempting to create a synthetic alternative for decades, but this year marks the first where a viable solution has gone to human trials. Electronic Skin [ 7 ] - The name might be a little misleading, but electronic skin could be hitting shelves sometime in the next five years. This super thin, lightweight, flexible film goes on over skin and offers incredible potential. Imagine watching TV on the back of your arm or getting continual health monitoring through a temporary tattoo. With e-skin, all of that may be possible. Emerging Biohackers. 
With these new technologies comes new opportunities and new risks. Biohackers, citizens interested in the potential of new technology, have developed small labs and tinker with everything from common houseplants to their own bodies. Designer babies are a concept that will be in legislative holes for decades, but once the technology is there, some people will be implementing changes to DNA at the basic level. The Internet of Things is all about devices talking to other devices, but?the Internet of Senses is also here in the form of a variety of wearable technologies. Ever more sensitive and miniaturized sensor technology makes it possible for devices to respond directly to changes in the human body. Human bodies will not only talk to devices but also other human bodies. We will also see the emergence of newer senses altogether. From Science Fiction to Science Fact. 
Advances to the biological sciences can change the world. Just the existence of the artificial womb can have a massive impact. Consider that maternal mortality is still a major pregnancy risk factor, particularly for older parents. With an artificial gestation mechanism, that risk disappears, allowing people to wait longer before they start a family. It also opens the way for non-traditional families. Artificial wombs would make it possible for men to gestate a baby without female intervention and give same-sex couples more access to the ability to start a family. With women not expected to take considerable amounts of time off to start a family, society could see the shattering of the glass ceiling that has long limited a women s potential in the workforce. Even this single development can have lasting and far-reaching consequences for modern society. Disruption to the human body could completely change the workplace, relationship dynamics, entertainment options and a whole lot more. With better bionic limbs, those with implants can actually accomplish more work, making them more productive not handicapped. Changes to the brain might increase native intelligence, but they could also alter human psychology and how people process emotions. Until these technologies reach the general market, it is difficult to say how society will adapt and change. The Ethics of Biological Revolution. 
With every technological advancement that deals directly with the human body comes a host of ethical considerations. Just looking at the artificial womb several people immediately jump out. If artificial pregnancy is less expensive than traditional gestation, it is likely that insurance companies will prioritize it. If it is more expensive, artificial wombs might only be available to the wealthy, deepening the already extant class divide. The same is true when discussing designer babies. The technology needed to support artificial wombs and create designer babies is already here. Cambridge researchers only ended their two - week study on an embryo outside the womb due to legal restrictions. Ethical issues are the limitation currently affecting modern technology. After all, in a world where the wealthiest live longer, healthier and enjoy an increased intelligence quotient, ethics becomes a major consideration when determining who has access and when to deploy these life changing technologies.

d00683aac3,"Francis effect growing among seminarians, says Theological College rector - National Catholic Reporter (blog)","Francis effect growing among seminarians, says Theological College rector<br />The Pope Francis effect?<br />Some express hope, others dread, still more argue that day-to-day church life is business-as- usual, with little change.<br />But Sulpician Fr. Phillip J. Brown, rector of the Theological College, the national diocesan seminary of the Catholic University of America in Washington, said the Francis effect is alive and well, and growing, at least among seminarians. It\'s been a sudden development.<br />Last fall, asked by reporters about the impact of Francis on the seminary, which educates and forms 84 men sponsored by dioceses across the U.S., the rector said it was too early to gauge. That\'s not true anymore, he told NCR in a recent interview.<br />A message the seminary always taught, he said, is catching on. \""You are not a priest to be a policeman. You are to be a pastor. That\'s the message of Francis,\"" he said.<br />\""Thank you!\""-NCR Staff<br />The numbers have remained steady, but the attitudes of newer arrivals has begun to transform the place, he said. That transformation will be felt soon at a parish near you.<br />The subject of change in the attitudes of seminarians is \""a delicate situation for me as a seminary rector,\"" acknowledged Brown, who will be moving on to a similar position at St. Mary\'s Seminary in Baltimore later this year.<br />\""Our basic approach to formation would have always been congenial to Pope Francis,\"" he said, noting in particular the requirement that seminarians engage in direct service to the poor, an opportunity readily available in the nation\'s capital. He\'s aware of complaints from some U.S. Catholics that sometimes the newly-ordained come into parishes intent on forcing changes of a more traditional view in liturgy and the role of clergy.<br />That view is \""contrary to how we form seminarians,\"" he said. \""We would always say to go in for a year or so and see where the parish is at. Then gain people\'s confidence if you want to make changes.\""<br />He\'s seeing a shift in attitudes among seminarians particularly in the areas of:<br />View of church tradition. \""They are more open to diversity,\"" he said, noting that there is less of an embrace of apologetics -- the view that church teaching should be preached to a secular culture that often ignores it -- and more of an embrace of the view, echoing Francis, \""to get in with people and see where they are ... The guys coming in now are more curious, ready to apply the teaching to people\'s real lives.\""<br />There\'s less focus on the sacerdotal nature of priesthood -- the view that priests are men set aside with particular sacramental powers -- and more on how a priest can work among people, what Francis has described as being a shepherd who smells like the sheep.<br />There is less of an emphasis on signs and symbols indicating traditionalism. They can seem like small things: the wearing of cassocks, Communion only on the tongue and not in the hand, to name two. But in recent years these symbols became what Brown described \""as markers of orthodoxy\"" with an indication that those who didn\'t follow such practices were suspect.<br />\""I don\'t see that now,\"" he said.<br />The newer seminarians have a more Francis-like, some would say Vatican II, view that the church should engage the culture and not see itself as a community set apart. Previously, seminarians were keenly aware that they were different from their peers in the wider culture of the millennial generation. They are now more likely to see themselves as very much like their peers in the wider world, with the goal of transforming the culture with the message of the Gospel.<br />More impressions from the seminary rector, who has been at the Theological College for the past five years:<br />Seminarians are more inclined to move from what Brown called a Calvinistic, rule-based view of moral theology, to a more nuanced understanding of the role of church teaching in people\'s lives. They are less likely to view psychological counseling with suspicion. The Francis message on the environment is also catching on, he said.<br />Those who see this change as good news can take heart, said Brown. The impact of Francis\' teachings is not only affecting new seminarians beginning studies early in his pontificate. It is also seeping into the culture of the entire system.<br />Parishioners, he said, should be seeing its impact in the ministry of newly-ordained priests within a few short years.<br />[Peter Feuerherd is a professor of communications and journalism at St. John\'s University in New York and contributor to NCR\'s Field Hospital blog.]<br />Editor\'s note: \""The Field Hospital\"" blog series covers life in U.S. and Canadian Catholic parishes. The title comes from Pope Francis\' words: \""I see the church as a field hospital after battle. It is useless to ask a seriously injured person if he has high cholesterol and about the level of his blood sugars! You have to heal his wounds.

a321083d05,6 steps for a successful lambing or kidding season - Wisfarmer,"6 steps for a successful lambing or kidding season<br />By Tom Earleywine, Ph.D., director of nutritional services for Land O\'Lakes Animal Milk Products Co.The health, growth and early performance of a lamb or kid crop directly impact\'s future performance in the milking parlor, pasture or showring. As a result, long-term successes can be driven by success during the lambing and kidding season. Nutrition is essential in giving lambs and kids a solid start. High quality milk replacer can be a solution to success; however, success is not guaranteed on milk replacer alone. Here is a look at six steps to a successful total management program shared at the 2015 Dairy Sheep Association of North America Symposium.Step 1: Set obtainable goals.Before the first lamb hits the ground, analyze past performance of the flock, set tangible goals and determine a path for achieving these goals.Consider a 200 percent lamb or kid crop as an attainable goal. Mature and well-conditioned ewes and does should be able to lamb at least two lambs or kids. Strive for less than 5 percent pre-weaning mortality. The industry target is less than 5 percent, but it\'s estimated that 20 percent of lambs are lost before weaning, with 80 percent of those losses in the first 10 days.Step 2: Provide newborn care.Within the first few minutes after a lamb or kid is born, they are exposed to bacteria and pathogens. Two ways to protect against these pathogens are navel disinfection and quality colostrum. Dip the newborn\'s navel in 7 percent tincture iodine immediately after birth; ensure the disinfectant covers both the outside and inside of the navel. Colostrum or the first milk in lactation is the primary protection newborns receive against environmental pathogens and bacteria. Lambs and kids should receive 10 percent of their body weight in colostrum by 18 hours of age, fed at 105 degrees F. For example, a 10 pound lamb should be fed 1 pound or 16 ounces of colostrum in the first 18 hours of its life.Keep in mind that fluctuations in colostrum quality and quantity are probable; a colostrum replacement can be used to ensure all lambs and kids receive a high-quality, disease-free colostrum. Step 3: Select a species-specific milk replacer.After newborns are fed high-quality colostrum or colostrum replacer for the first feeding, they can be transitioned to a milk replacer.Look for a milk replacer made specifically for lambs or kids. Many options of milk replacer may be available to you, but calves, lambs, kids, pigs, alpacas, puppies and kittens all have different nutrient requirements. Milk replacers formulated for lambs are better able to provide the nutrients lambs require because they closely mimic the composition of ewe\'s milk. The same is true with kid-specific milk replacers for kid goats. Step 4: Choose the right feeding system.Bottle feeding, free-choice feeding or an automated system are the three primary means of feeding lambs and kids on milk replacer. Select which system is the best fit by considering the facilities, size of operation, labor situation and performance objectives. Make sure the system provides enough nutrition so lambs and kids at least triple their birth weight by 28 days of age. Clean and disinfect the system as often as possible.Step 5: Stimulate rumen development.The rumen is the main site for nutrient breakdown and absorption in mature ruminants and in other species has been highly correlated to health and performance of the animal. When a lamb or kid is born, the rumen is not fully developed and neither are the papillae inside the rumen. Growth of the rumen papillae and rumen development can be correlated with what the lamb or kid eats pre-weaning.If the rumen is not developed appropriately, weaning can be delayed or unsuccessful. Water is a critical ingredient in the development of bacterial growth and the beginning of rumen fermentation. Always provide free choice water.Step 6: Promote a smooth weaning transition.Lambs and kids are ready for weaning when they consume an equivalent of 1.5 percent of their body weight in high-quality creep feed along with adequate water. Usually this will occur near 30 days of age or 35 pounds of weight. At weaning time, each lamb should have consumed at least 25 pounds of lamb milk replacer powder.Follow these steps to weaning:Plan weaning protocol, timing and facilities 14 to 21 days prior to weaning.Ensure animals are consuming creep feed and utilizing water.Gradually remove milk replacer or remove ewe.Feed a high protein ration (18 to 25 percent crude protein). Following these six steps provides a total management system for successfully raising lambs or kids, especially when on milk replacer. Setting goals, providing a high-quality colostrum and milk replacer, comfortable housing, and ready access to high quality feed and water will help lambs and kids thrive.

d03b14f84e,A Canadian Perspective On World IBD Day - Huffington Post Canada,"A Canadian Perspective On World IBD Day<br />Imagine if you were sick but people didn\'t believe you.<br />Imagine you had to describe symptoms you\'d rather keep private - like bloody diarrhea, excruciating abdominal pain, anxiety and fatigue - in order to convince someone you were actually sick.<br />This is far too often the situation that people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have to face. In many cases people with IBD look perfectly \'normal\' on the outside, but inside they\'re confronting an incurable immune system dysfunction that\'s causing their body to attack itself.<br />Approximately one in 150 Canadians have Crohn\'s disease or ulcerative colitis - the two main forms of IBD. These incidence rates are some of the highest in the world. What\'s more, the number of Canadian children under the age of five diagnosed with Crohn\'s or colitis grew by 7.2% between 1999 and 2010.<br />But it\'s not just the people diagnosed who feel the effects of IBD. In Crohn\'s and Colitis Canada\'s 2012 Impact of IBD Report, we found that caregiver costs for parents of children living with these diseases totaled $7 million. Even if you take the staggering financial cost out of the equation, parents are still left to bear the emotional toll of caring for a child who deserves better health.<br />Without awareness and empathy, Canadians can be left to battle their disease in silence, and the isolation only makes life with IBD that much harder. That\'s why May 19, World IBD Day, is so vital. It\'s an opportunity to bring Crohn\'s and colitis into the open and show everyone impacted that their challenges are real and recognized, and that they\'re not alone in taking on the disease.<br />Crohn\'s and Colitis Canada promises to cure IBD[1] and better the lives of everyone affected by these diseases. The first step to achieving this is to raise awareness and unite people in the fight. <br />Last year over 140 landmarks worldwide were lit in purple for World IBD Day to raise awareness of the disease, including many from across Canada. On May 19, we\'ll be turning the Science World in Vancouver, CN Tower, Niagara Falls, Montreal and Halifax City Halls, and many more landmarks purple again. We\'ll also be posting plenty more about Crohn\'s disease and ulcerative colitis on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram - find us @getgutsycanada.<br />But even more than spotting purple places and retweeting posts on World IBD Day, I hope you\'ll take a moment to think about just how hard life can be with inflammatory bowel disease. Think about what it would be like to have to use the bathroom 30 times in one day. Think about being so exhausted that you aren\'t able to get out of bed. Think about how anxious you\'d feel if a medication you were on showed signs of failing. And think about how all of that, can be just another day in the life of someone with IBD.<br />Follow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook<br />Suggest a correction[2]<br />References^ Crohn\'s and Colitis Canada promises to cure IBD (crohnsandcolitis.ca)^ Suggest a correction (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGi58M-gJapFsOoRczgII--0MrQjA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779499555490&ei=DxBOWYi7I8XQW4-hiPAN&url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mina-mawani/canada-world-ibd-day_b_16685024.html,EN,,24/06/2017 07:09,2017-05-18 15:50:50+00:00,a3eed62f3b,Huffington Post Canada,,,,,1495129850,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2e9795e4ae,"South Shore: Pregnant woman found killed, 4 fatally shot in restaurant attack - Chicago Tribune","4 killed in South Shore: \'It is not OK when we lose a child like this\'<br />When the shooting stopped Thursday afternoon in South Shore two young men lay dead inside a restaurant, with another dead outside and a fourth dead around the corner, slumped against a tree.A woman had been found shot to death in an apartment less than a mile away[1] about four hours earlier in the same neighborhood, but her death was not believed related.<br />Outside Nadia Fish and Chicken restaurant at 75th Street and Coles Avenue, paramedics draped a sheet over the man as his mother, wearing a red apron because she was working inside at the time of the shooting, grieved through tears. \""It is not OK. It is not OK when we lose a child like this,\"" she said as officers guided her and others away from the body. \""There\'s two dead - there\'s two other boys in there.\""<br />Three ambulances had arrived in minutes but left almost as quickly as the first three people they found were all pronounced dead at the scene.As the young man\'s mother leaned against and pounded her fists on the hood of a blue-and-white police SUV parked across from her son\'s body on Coles Avenue, officers ran toward a commotion farther south. Behind an apartment building on Coles they found the fourth victim, slumped against a tree. It was the woman\'s other son.Soon after, a man tried to walk along a barbed wire fence that he climbed to get behind the building, telling police the victim was his brother.An exasperated look came over an officer\'s face as he looked to the ground while another pair of officers started pushing people back.<br />One child still carrying his backpack, with the hood of his winter coat pulled over his head, looked at the body and turned away. A woman put her hand on his back and guided him back toward 75th.The four were fatally shot about 3:50 p.m. A male attacker approached the restaurant and fired shots. It was not immediately clear how many of the four were inside or outside the restaurant at the time of the shooting.Dillon Jackson, 20, was found dead outside the restaurant with his mother looking on. His brother, Raheem Jackson, was found against the tree. Emmanuel Stokes, 28, was inside the store with a fourth victim whose identity authorities had not released late Thursday because his family hadn\'t been reached.<br />The shooting may have been part of an internal gang conflict involving the Black P Stones gang, in retaliation for the killing of a 37-year-old man in the 7900 block of South Phillips Avenue about 11:15 p.m. Wednesday, police sources said.The four shot on 75th Street were among at least nine people wounded or killed in shootings during daylight hours Thrusday. Their deaths do not appear related to another South Shore homicide just hours earlier - a 26-year-old woman who was 4 months pregnant was found shot to death inside an apartment at 75th Street and Luella Avenue a few blocks west.The Jacksons\' grandmother, Georgia Jackson, 72, said at the scene that the two had gone to the restaurant to get food and to see their mother, who works there. After the shooting, their mother called Georgia Jackson to tell her that \""They shot Dillon,\"" and by the time she arrived, Raheem Jackson had been found in a backyard.\""We got a call from their mama. She only said one at first but when I got here they said they found the other.\""\""I just want them to pick him up ... when they get him off the ground I\'ll go with him,\"" Georgia said. \""I didn\'t have kids to lose \'em like this.\""The crowd that officers struggled to keep away from the scene dwindled as the night wore on. So too did the number of police department bosses that had for a time clogged the intersection of 75th and Coles.Evidence technicians, detectives and beat cops remained behind, guarding a scene that extended a half block out in each direction from the restaurant. But the Jackson brothers\' mother remained. She blamed herself. She questioned her faith. She said she had nothing to live for, and that she planned to take her own life. \""I can\'t go on, my life is over. I\'m \'bout to goddamn kill myself.\""\""I was standing right here in the window, they killed \'em right in front of me\""Her family consoled her. They hugged her. When she ducked under the tape to try and see her sons, the officers guided her gently away from lines of sight but kept her inside the crime scene. She paced through ankle-deep water in a nursing home parking lot to get to a black iron fence, peering into the yard where Raheem lay slumped against a tree. A relative nudged her away. She settled in a space in the parking lot, inside the tape but near the officers, a space she called a \""mutual zone\"" where she was about the same distance from each of her dead sons. \""I gottta stand with \'em both. I can\'t leave. I gotta stay with both my sons \'til they get \'em up,\"" she said.As evidence technicians worked in the yard behind the apartment building and took photos of Raheem, his mother drifted toward the black iron fence. The officers and her relatives gave her space. She stood alone in standing water, under a street lamp, and looked at her son.References^ less than a mile away (www.chicagotribune.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFEarKMWkU4PC8EKaELzy2PFI0_tg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779444160830&ei=WQHeWJD3HJKOWI70mwg&url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-chicago-violence-shootings-20170330-story.html,EN,,31/03/2017 07:12,2017-03-31 00:58:00+00:00,ece86a9f0a,Chicago Tribune,,,,,1490929080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ff04e031d7,"Trump\'s aid cuts risk pushing African women \'into the Dark Ages,\' spelling trouble for rising world population - The Globe and Mail","Trump\'s aid cuts risk pushing African women \'into the Dark Ages,\' spelling trouble for rising world population<br />AFRICA<br />Africa\'s staggering growth is fuelling a global migration crisis and keeping millions in poverty and constant pregnancy. But Washington is cutting support for family planning programs, while Ottawa is ramping it up. In Benin,<br />Geoffrey York takes a look at the African women whose futures are at stake<br />Flavienne San and her daughter Ana head home from contraception boat, nicknamed the Barque Mobile, in So-Ava, Benin. The boat and its crew travel from village to village in a lagoon in southern Benin to spread information about family planning.<br />PHOTOGRAPHY BY VINCENT TREMEAU FOR THE UNFPA<br />Geoffrey York[1]<br />GANVIE, BENIN<br />The Globe and Mail<br />Last updated: Thursday, Apr. 06, 2017 11:24AM EDT<br />The contraception boat has arrived, and now it\'s time for a party. \""Ladies, have you heard the news?\"" the singer tells the villagers as his drummers strike up a pulsing beat. <br />\""You can take a pill every day,\"" he croons to the women sitting beneath a sprawling tree where goats and chickens roam past. \""You can be with your husband and only have children when you want.\"" <br />People sing and dance during a family-planning event in Ganvie. <br />Women leap to their feet and dance to the music. \""Shame on the men who have lots of wives,\"" the singer tells them as he prepares for a condom demonstration. \""Woe to the women who have lots of children. Two is okay, three is already good.\"" <br />Many of the women in this isolated village have never heard of modern contraception. But when the music is finished and the dancing is over, a few climb aboard the brightly painted boat, venturing inside for their first glimpse of a new future. <br />Villages such as this one, in rural Benin, are the fragile front line of a global battle over population growth and women\'s bodies - a battle that has now expanded to draw in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump on conflicting sides of the issue. <br />The contraception boat uses a loudspeaker and a raucous sound system to attract attention. <br />The contraception boat and its crew, puttering cheerfully from village to village in a lagoon in southern Benin, is the latest innovation in an intensifying campaign by family-planning agencies to break the cycle of near-constant pregnancy that exhausts and oppresses millions of African women and stokes the rapid growth of population and migration worldwide. <br />But the contraception campaign has been dealt a blow by Mr. Trump. Just days after taking office, he ordered a halt to an estimated $600-million (U.S.) in annual support for family planning and health programs overseas. Any international program in which women are informed about the abortion option will have its U.S. funding removed, in a policy known as the \""global gag rule.\"" <br />This week, Mr. Trump went even further. His administration announced that it will eliminate all U.S. support to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), accusing it of supporting a Chinese agency in \""coercive abortion\"" policies, despite an earlier U.S. acknowledgment that there is no evidence of UNFPA funding for abortions in China. The eliminated U.S. funds will have a huge impact on reproductive health programs in the developing world, since the United States has been one of the biggest donors to the UN program. <br />The Trump cuts, an expanded version of earlier Republican policies, have triggered a global push back. Analysts say the Trump policy could lead to 6.5 million unintended pregnancies over the next four years. A new global fund to replace the lost U.S. money has raised about $200-million so far, including $20-million (Canadian) from Canada. Without it, women could be pushed \""into the Dark Ages,\"" according to Belgium\'s deputy prime minister, Alexander De Croo. <br />In addition to its contribution to the new fund, Canada launched a bigger response to the Trump cuts on March 8, International Women\'s Day, when Mr. Trudeau announced a $650-million three-year fund for reproductive and sexual health and rights in the developing world, including contraception and legal abortion programs. <br />African women are at the centre of these issues, but politicians have neglected them for decades. To understand the human pain and conflict at the heart of the population debates, The Globe and Mail travelled to the remote fishing villages of Benin. In these impoverished corners of the continent, the contraception campaign is more urgent than almost anywhere else in the world. <br />In a country like Benin, the impact of the campaign could be enormous. It finally offers hope to long-suffering women whose health has been badly damaged by decades of child-bearing. <br />But it could also help to slow the rapid rate of population growth that has helped create a global migration crisis, which in turn has fuelled the rise of nationalist politicians in Europe and the United States, along with controversial policies such as Mr. Trump\'s temporary halt to migrants from six Muslim-majority countries. The migration pressures from Africa\'s soaring population will also be felt in Canada, where immigration remains a divisive issue. <br />The fertility rate in Sub-Saharan Africa today is alarmingly high: about 5.1 children in a woman\'s lifetime, more than double the global average. And the population boom is concentrated in the world\'s poorest and most fragile countries, the ones least able to cope. The world\'s highest fertility rates today are in the impoverished West African nations of Niger (7.5 children per woman) and Mali (6.8 children). <br />Benin\'s fertility rate is not far behind those nations. \""If you tell your husband that you don\'t want a large family, he will just go and marry another woman,\"" says Christiane Djengue, the mother of eight children in the fishing village of Houedo-Gbadji in southern Benin. <br />\""It\'s a lot of pressure. Our husbands love children and large families.\"" <br />Her husband, Jacob, is happy with his big family, and even took a second wife. \""You need a lot of babies because you never know how many are going to live and how many are going to die,\"" he says. \""What if we had only two babies and both died?\"" <br />But the cost to his wife is enormous. She has given birth 10 times over the past 19 years, and two of her children died. \""I\'ve had too many babies,\"" she says. \""I feel sicker and weaker. I suffer illnesses, like hypertension. I get headaches and vertigo and fatigue.\"" <br />The African population boom, illustrated<br />Total fertility (medium projection) by country, 2015-2020<br />Percentage of people aged 60 or older by 2050<br />Graphics by Murat Yükselir/The Globe and Mail (Source: UN World Population Prospects, 2015 revision) <br />\"" +<br />\""\"" + d3format(_this.data[d.properties.id][selectedYear]) +<br />\""\"");<br />function getShapeXY() {<br />function getCentroids(){<br />var xy = {};<br />var _xy = projection(centroids[d.properties.id].xy);<br />xy.x = _xy[0];<br />xy.y = _xy[1];<br />return xy;<br />};<br />var shapeBox = (centroids[d.properties.id] !== undefined) ? getCentroids() : d3.select(shape).node().getBBox();<br />var padding = (_this.zoomed) ? 30 : 0;<br />shapeBoxX = (shapeBox.x * _this.zoomScale) + _this.zoomTranslate[0];<br />shapeBoxY = (shapeBox.y * _this.zoomScale) + _this.zoomTranslate[1];<br />if(shapeBox.width && shapeBox.height){<br />shapeBoxW = shapeBox.width / 2 * _this.zoomScale;<br />shapeBoxH = shapeBox.height / 2 * _this.zoomScale;<br />xDifference = shapeBoxX+(shapeBox.width * _this.zoomScale) -

it could also curb an explosive rate of population growth that threatens the future of the planet. <br />Population growth is helping to fuel many of the world\'s biggest crises, from climate change to migration and war. Many African countries can\'t produce enough jobs to keep pace with the birth rate, and people are left fighting over diminishing resources. The impact can be felt from the refugee camps of Nigeria and the malnourished children of Central Africa to the migrant boats of the Mediterranean and the human-trafficking routes of the Sahara and the Middle East. <br />Demography helps to explain why Africa is becoming increasingly crucial to the fate of the Earth. While the rest of the world has seen a sharp drop in its birth rate in recent decades, Africa\'s fertility rate has remained persistently high, to the surprise of experts who assumed Africa would follow the global pattern. <br />Africa\'s growth is now expected to be much more rapid than demographers had predicted. By the end of this century, the continent will be home to 4.4 billion people - a staggering fourfold increase from today, and double the number that the United Nations had been predicting a decade ago. <br />By the year 2100, according to UN studies, nearly half of the world\'s children will be African. The continent will account for more than 80 per cent of global population growth, pushing the world\'s population to a new peak of 11.2 billion. For better or worse, Africa will shape the world\'s destiny. <br />As the population boom gains momentum, humanity is increasingly becoming African. By the end of the century, about 40 per cent of the world\'s population will be African. Five of the world\'s 10 most populous countries will be African countries: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Niger and Tanzania. One nation alone, Nigeria, is projected to have 752 million people by 2100 and will be contributing more births to the world than any other country. <br />The consequences for the planet\'s health and environment will be immense. Africa\'s economies are unlikely to keep pace with this dramatic population increase. The result could be an escalating crisis in hunger, overcrowding, ecological damage, and rising migration pressures in Europe and North America and within Africa itself. <br />The Globe\'s investigation in Benin helps reveal how this extraordinary African population boom is driven by a disturbing pattern of inequality and discrimination against women. Shackled by illiteracy, poverty and cultural taboos, a quarter of married African women who want to avoid pregnancy still have no access to modern contraception. They remain subject to traditional and religious leaders who urge them to have large families, despite the risks to their health. Husbands and elders routinely pressure them into having more children than they can safely nurture. <br />Many African women have their first children in their teenage years and continue with scarcely a pause for much of their adulthood. Many women believe they need their husband\'s authorization before they can take contraception. Rumours and religious edicts have persuaded them that birth control is dangerous. And many African nations contribute to the crisis by criminalizing abortion and making contraception difficult to obtain, in rural regions especially. <br />\""Our pastor told us that we can never use family planning,\"" says Claudine Degbo, who belongs to a Methodist church in her home village of So-Ava in southern Benin. <br />Claudine Degbo: \'If I was to tell you about my suffering, it would take the whole day.\' <br />After her first two children, she felt that her family was too poor to afford more. But she felt obliged to obey her husband and her church. She knew nothing about contraception, and it was impossible to talk to her husband about her desire to avoid pregnancy. So she had two more children, and both died. And then her husband took two more wives, so that he could have more children. \""If I was to tell you about my suffering, it would take the whole day,\"" Ms. Degbo says. <br />Yet throughout her ordeals, she has never questioned the pastor\'s edict that contraception is banned. \""Our faith forbids it,\"" she says. \""When a teacher tells you something, you should obey.\"" <br />To be sure, some African countries have made progress on family planning, especially in urban areas. Countries such as Zambia and Kenya have rapidly boosted the availability and use of contraception. But a recent study by a non-profit partnership, Family Planning 2020, identified 14 countries worldwide with the slowest growth in the use of contraception - and all 14 were in Africa. <br />Outside of Kenya and Southern Africa, less than 30 per cent of African women are using modern contraception. In many regions of West Africa and Central Africa, less than 10 per cent of women are using contraception. In Benin, for example, only about 7 per cent of married women are using contraception. <br />That\'s why the UNFPA and its local partners in Benin have begun using innovative ideas such as the \""contraception boat\"" to provide information and supplies to remote villages where families of 10 or 12 children are still common. <br />The contraception boat has to navigate into narrow rivers to reach So-Ava, a cluster of fishing villages in Benin. <br />So-Ava is home to some 120,000 of the poorest people in Benin. <br />A young girl bails out a boat in downtown Ganvie. <br />The boat and the women<br />Every day, the boat cruises slowly through a lagoon of fishing villages known as So-Ava, home to some 120,000 of the poorest people in the country. Most live in rickety huts of wooden slats and metal roofs, suspended over the water on stilts. Small canoes are their only link to the outside world. The birth rate in rural Benin is 5.4 children per woman, but in So-Ava the average is seven children. <br />The flat-bottomed boat, nicknamed the Barque Mobile, uses a loudspeaker and a raucous sound system to attract attention. As it motors down the canals and rivers, it pumps out a steady beat of loud rhythmic music. Men sometimes dance on the stairs of their stilt houses as the boat passes. <br />At each village, when the Barque Mobile docks, a few curious women step cautiously aboard. Inside the boat, nurses work in two small clinics, giving counselling and contraception to the women. From tidy cabinets and desks, they hand out stocks of condoms and explain samples of birth-control pills, IUDs, implants and injections to those who are willing to give them a try. <br />At other stops on the boat\'s route, the campaigners organize boisterous meetings with music and speeches. \""Who knows what contraception is?\"" a nurse asks a crowd of about 100 women (and a few men) in the stilt village of Ganvie. <br />\""Me, me,\"" a few women shout. <br />\""If you have a lot of children, you\'ll have a shorter life, and you won\'t be able to take care of your children,\"" one of the campaigners tells the crowd. <br />They hold up a poster with pictures of the various contraception methods. They explain the benefits of \""spacing\"" a couple\'s children, with several years between births. They bring out a male musician to demonstrate the use of a condom on a carved wooden phallus, with much commotion and laughing from the audience, and they correct him on his errors. <br />\""When your husband comes home and wants to get together with you, you tell him, \'Hey boy, that\'s not the way you do it, here\'s the way you do it,\'\"" a nurse tells the women. <br />Then the campaigners answer questions about the contraception methods, dispelling some of the common myths. No, they tell the men, an IUD won\'t cause any injury to you during sex. No, they tell the women, taking the pill won\'t make it more difficult to have children later. <br />Among the crowd in Ganvie is a woman named Albertine Hoyeton. She is clutching her three-year-old son, her youngest child. Until she heard the loudspeaker from the approaching boat that day, she knew nothing about modern contraception. With her fisherman husband, she had five children in seven years - at great cost to her health. <br />\""I was strong, but then I had several children,\"" she says. \""And now I\'m weak and I\'m often sick and I can\'t do many things. I don\'t sleep much, because I always have worries on my mind.\"" <br />She often sees teenage mothers in her village. \""I feel sorry for them, because their lives are miserable.\"" <br />She wants her children\'s lives to be different. She wants them to use contraception, and she hopes that at least one of them will grow up to be a doctor. <br />Simplicia Zannou and her husband, Bourasma Kokossou, consult a nurse about birth control on a mobile clinic boat in the So-Ava commune of Benin. <br />At another stop, Simplicia Zannou climbs aboard the boat with her husband and infant son. She is about 20 years old. (Like many people in Benin, she\'s not sure of her exact age.) She and her husband already have three children, and they want to learn about contraception. They listen quietly as the nurse explains the various methods. They decide that they prefer the pill. Then, as a routine check, the nurse asks if she can do a pregnancy test before prescribing the pills. <br />A few minutes later, the test strip reveals that Ms. Zannou is pregnant. She stares at the floor in shock, mopping her brow, while her husband laughs and plays with their baby. <br />\""Another child,\"" she murmurs to her husband. \""We should have been finished with this. I told you before that we should have ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"one for family planning.\"""" <br />Her husband", a tailor named Bourasma Kokossou, has been dominating the conversation in the nurse\'s office," even when the questions are directed to his wife. \""""She\'ll just say exactly what I say","\"""" he explains. \""""My wife obeys me. Without my approval"," she can\'t do anything. She can\'t even move.\"""" <br />Simplicia Zannou and her husband", Bourasma Kokossou, play with their son Midokpe at home. <br />But later, in a back room of their village home, Ms. Zannou agrees to talk without her husband\'s presence. Their small two-room hut, filled with fabric and sewing machines, is built on stilts over the swampy water. Its floor is of rough wooden slats, and its walls are papered with tattered newspapers," old calendars and magazine pages. <br />Ms. Zannou is worried that her family cannot afford another child. She\'s afraid that her children\'s health could be affected by the burden of another newborn child. Her family is already sometimes forced to cut back to just one meal a day when the tailoring business is slow. <br />\""""How are we going to cope with this situation?\"""" she asked her husband when they returned from the boat after the news of her pregnancy. <br />\""""Don\'t worry about the money", we\'ll get more customers,"\"""" he told her. <br />And then they stopped talking about it. \""""In our community", the wife always does what the husband tells her to do,"\"""" Ms. Zannou says. \""""The church tells us to obey our husbands.\"""" <br />Simplicity Zannou and her husband already have three children. <br />While wives are taught to await their husband\'s authorization for family planning", husbands are allowed to have multiple wives. Only the first wife is legally registered," but their right to \""""marry\"""" other women is widely condoned. In Benin", there are popular songs on local radio stations that jauntily tout the benefits of polygamy. <br />With these patriarchal attitudes firmly entrenched, Benin is one of the 14 African countries that have been the slowest to adopt modern contraception methods. Its government wants to persuade 20 per cent of women to begin using contraception by 2020, compared to the current rate of 12 per cent, but the goal is unlikely to be met. <br />Childbearing begins much too early in life for many African women. In some African countries, half of all girls are married before the age of 18. In Benin, girls are sometimes promised to men as future wives from the moment they are born, often to settle a family debt. The result is a huge number of teen pregnancies. Worldwide," about 18 million adolescent girls give birth every year in developing countries. <br />\""""You see grandmothers and their daughters with babies at the same time","\"""" says Koudaogo Ouedraogo"," the UNFPA representative in Benin. \""""We can\'t continue with business as usual.\"""" <br />It\'s almost impossible to make significant improvement in education and economic development if the contraception rate is below 20 per cent", UN specialists say. <br />Even the spacing of children - allowing more than two years between births - can have a dramatic effect in reducing the death rate among children and mothers, while improving health and education levels. Bill and Melinda Gates, the billionaire philanthropists," argue that contraception is \""""one of the greatest life-saving and anti-poverty innovations in history.\"""" <br />In the impoverished villages of So-Ava"," progress is so slow that a typical year would see only 60 or 70 women adopting contraception for the first time. But the campaigners found that they could triple this rate by using the boat to spread the message. Now they plan to add three more boats to the circuit. <br />\""""The boat has come here like a saviour","\"""" says André Todje"," the deputy mayor of So-Ava. \""""Otherwise women would have no encouragement to reduce their family size. According to our tradition"," women have no right to decide on children.\"""" <br />Mr. Todje sometimes goes to the village\'s churches on Sundays to spread the message about the risks of large families. But he admits that he\'s not allowed to mention contraception. \""""It\'s difficult","\"""" he sighs. \""""It\'s hard to get the message across in a church.\"""" <br />In photos: The mothers of Benin <br />Flavienne San",20," and her 18-month-old daughter Ana. Benin is one of the 14 African countries that have been the slowest to adopt modern contraception methods. <br />Children are an important marker of \""""family wealth\"""" in Ganvie", explains Houhkpe Debora," 20. \""""If you don\'t have any children"," you are nothing here. So my son is my joy.\"""" <br />A woman stands on her boat outside of a house in So-Ava. For many in the community", small canoes are their only link to the outside world. <br />Celestine Soke,40, has five living children, and lost five children. \'I heard about the family planning before, but people were saying it was making women sick. It is when I saw the brand new boat and when they gave me a lot of information that I started being convinced.\' <br />The obstacles<br />In a country where illiteracy is common, the contraception boat has sparked wild rumours and suspicions. Some villagers claim that it must be a brothel. When doctors deny it," they are accused of taking bribes. <br />Other villagers are convinced that the boat\'s family-planning ideas are a \""""Mami Wata\"""" practice - a reference to a mermaid-like water spirit in traditional religions"," which local churches often portray as evil. They are afraid that the spirit will cause their death if they enter the boat. <br />\""""We tell them that it\'s nothing to do with Mami Wata","\"""" says a nurse", Laetitia Gnansounou, who works for OSV Jordan," a local health group that runs the Barque Mobile with the UN\'s help. \""""There\'s a widespread idea that if they use contraception", they could die. In church," they\'re told that their mission from God is to multiply - to produce a lot of children.\"""" <br />To counteract the religious edicts", the family planning advocates tell the villagers that they should have only as many children as they can afford. But even in a desperately poor village," the villagers often reject this argument. <br />\""""They think children are their wealth","\"""" says Benin\'s health minister"," Alassane Seidou. \""""It\'s a paradox. They think", \'If we don\'t have money," we should at least have children.\'\"""" <br />The problems in Benin are just a microcosm of a global crisis. The UN has estimated that 220 million married women worldwide are unable to get access to contraception", even though they want to avoid pregnancy. It\'s a shocking and worrisome number. <br />In some parts of the world, there has been strong progress in expanding access to contraception. One initiative, Family Planning 2020, estimates that 30 million women across the world have begun using contraception since the current campaign began in 2012. Yet this is still 19 million fewer women than the campaigners had hoped to reach by now, and they admit that their goal is unlikely to be achieved by the target date. <br />Even before the effect of the Trump cuts are fully felt, the UNFPA is lagging behind in its goal of raising $1.2-billion (U.S.) for contraception and other reproductive health supplies for the developing world over the next four years. Less than half of the target amount has been raised so far. <br />Until recently, Canada\'s contribution has been small. When the former Conservative government launched the high-profile $2.85-billion (Canadian) Muskoka Initiative for maternal and child health in the developing world in 2010, only about 1.2 per cent of the money was allocated to family planning, according to estimates by an advocacy group, Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights. Federal spending on family planning after 2010 was actually lower than in previous years, it says. <br />The Conservative government, apparently for ideological reasons, halted Canada\'s contributions to the UN fund for contraceptive supplies after 2010, although some money was indirectly allocated for family planning through its support to UNFPA. (Canada gave about $70-million to UNFPA in 2015, but most was for programs supporting midwives and opposing child marriage.) <br />Babatunde Osotimehin, executive director of the UNFPA," told journalists last year that the Conservative maternal-health policy had treated women in the developing world \""""as bodies that deliver babies.\"""" <br />A recent federal review of the Muskoka Initiative has confirmed that family planning was \""""underrepresented\"""" in the Canadian program. The shortage of family planning services is responsible for about 29 per cent of maternal deaths worldwide", the review said, citing published estimates. <br />The Conservatives also refused to include any mention of abortion in the health initiative. Abortion is illegal or heavily restricted in most of Africa, including Benin. This obliges women to have unwanted children, or forces them into the hands of unsafe abortion providers. The World Health Organization estimates that six million unsafe abortions are performed in Africa every year, resulting in 29,000 deaths and countless injuries. <br />Despite the Canadian refusal to include any discussion of abortion policy in the early years of the Muskoka Initiative," some African leaders are surprisingly willing to talk about decriminalizing abortion. \""""With time", our society will evolve towards it,"\"""" says Mr. Seidou"," the Benin health minister. \""""Unsafe illegal abortions are injuring many women. It\'s forbidden", but it happens anyway," so why not enable women to do it in safer conditions?\"""" <br />Yet the irony is that the number of unsafe abortions is expected to increase sharply as a direct result of Mr. Trump\'s cuts to family planning programs. <br />In the past", whenever a Republican administration has cut the U.S. aid budget for family planning, studies have found a rise in the abortion rate. In one study, the abortion rate increased by 40 per cent in 20 African countries as a result of the U.S. policy. With less access to contraception, women often feel that abortion is their only choice - yet abortion is usually illegal, so they turn to dangerous clandestine providers, which results in thousands of injuries and deaths every year. <br />Under the $650-million three-year strategy that Mr. Trudeau has announced, the Canadian government will support a range of reproductive and sexual health rights in developing countries, including contraception and legal abortion. It will also provide funds to advocacy groups that challenge the anti-abortion laws in the estimated 125 countries where abortion is illegal or severely restricted. <br />Sandeep Prasad, executive director of Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights, says the new strategy is a step in the right direction. But it amounts to less than $220-million annually, and he argues that Canada needs to spend much more on family planning in the developing world. <br />His group has proposed that Canada help to replace the U.S. cuts by spending a total of $450-million annually on contraception and other sexual and reproductive health programs in the developing world. This could prevent more than four million unintended pregnancies and a million unsafe abortions annually, it says. <br />Christiane Djengue sits on fishing nets and plays with her son while her husband rest in the bedroom. She has given birth to 10 children in 19 years, but suffered complications in most of the pregnancies. <br />What the future holds<br />For many women in Africa, contraception is a late discovery, after a lifetime of children. Christiane Djengue, the woman who gave birth to 10 children in 19 years in a fishing village in southern Benin, suffered complications in most of her births. She remembers how she began thinking of getting an abortion after the seventh pregnancy," but a hospital nurse told her it was impossible. \""""This hospital will never do it","\"""" the nurse told her. <br />Only after her 10 th birth - when she almost died", trekking from hospital to hospital, bleeding, as she searched for a place that would give her a C-section operation - did she finally visit the Barque Mobile and get a birth-control injection. Nobody had told her about modern contraception before. <br />Today," her life is still difficult. \""""I can\'t relax", except when the children are sleeping, because one of my kids could fall into the water and drown,"\"""" she says. <br />But she seems cheerful as she sits on a pile of fishing nets in her stilt house", breastfeeding her youngest baby," then playing with him and patting him affectionately. \""""It\'s because of this baby", my 10 th, that I finally went to family planning,"\"""" she says", laughing. <br />There is hope, too, from a younger generation of urban women, who are increasingly aware of contraception. Larissa Koukoui, a 22-year-old university student in Benin\'s biggest city, Cotonou, says she wants to be married by 26 and then have three children at the most. On a recent day in Cotonou, she was visiting a clinic to ask about changing her contraception method. <br />Like most of her university friends, she has been using condoms, because of rumours that birth-control pills could make it difficult for her to have children later. But now she is thinking about switching to the pill," if the clinic doctor will dispel the false rumours. <br />\""""This is Africa", and most of our mothers don\'t use these methods,"\"""" Ms. Koukoui says. \""""Our mothers tell us", \'We didn\'t use it," so you shouldn\'t.\' But our generation is better informed.\"""" <br />Beyond her own personal needs", she is convinced that Benin must limit its population growth. She sees people living in terrible conditions in Cotonou," in flimsy houses among piles of garbage. \""""I see people suffering in poverty and living in dangerous areas", and I tell myself that nobody should be living in those conditions,"\"""" she says. <br />\""""The more people there are"," the less that nature can support us.\"""" <br />Sellers"," passengers and fishermen navigate on the Ouémé River after leaving Ganvie wharf at the end of the day. <br />AN AGING AND GROWING WORLD: MORE FROM THE GLOBE AND MAIL <br />References^ Go to Geoffrey York\'s author page (news.google.com)""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGbGwDX9Cwf93Dhw4k1600bkHMqtA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=WjrnWPjaKMXGW5S2prAB&url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-contraception-and-population-growth/article34599155/,EN,,07/04/2017 07:06,2017-04-06 12:13:37+00:00,6df579530d,The Globe and Mail,,,,,1491488017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ff0bf844ee,Bad weather hits milk production - The Scottish Farmer,"Bad weather hits milk production (From The Scottish Farmer)<br />MILK buyers are being urged to adopt a common-sense approach to milk price penalties as wet weather has hit production hard.<br />Met Office figures put June rainfall in the West of Scotland at its highest level since 1910 and heavy showers have continued across the whole country during July and August. <br />As a result, many dairy farmers are not only facing reduced production and higher feeding costs, but also a potential penalty from their milk buyer for not hitting their projected target production.<br />NFU Scotland has contacted the main milk purchasers in Scotland in recent days, urging them to take the exceptional circumstances into consideration before hammering producers with price reductions. <br />Milk policy manager, George Jamieson, said: \""For the avoidance of any doubt, NFU Scotland totally supports the need for farmers to work with their milk buyer and supply predicted production figures. <br />\""However, we also believe that these predictive figures can only be calculated on factors that can be accurately predicted. <br />\""As we know all-to-well in Scotland, one factor which cannot be predicted is the weather. We believe producers and processors should work on effective predictions, but with the ability to amend on an ongoing basis when exceptional circumstances, like record June rainfall, crop up.<br />\""We have been contacted by numerous concerned producers in recent days, some of whom have had to bring their cows inside to avoid damaging wet pasture, and are already feeding increased concentrates to help stall production losses and ensure freshly calved cows are looked after. <br />\""All this costs money and we believe it is harsh and insensitive to add price penalties to the burden.<br />\""The milk buyers we have contacted have been open to our calls, and appear understanding of the situation. <br />\""Their advice is if farmers are concerned about meeting production predictions, then they should contact them and explain their position. <br />\""Major milk buyer Muller also explained that it was being proactive in developing better predictive tools that would benefit both it and their farmers, which we support.<br />\""We remain adamant that where poor, unseasonal weather has impacted on production, then there should be no penalties applied by any processor. <br />\""Such penalties will not help farmers in a difficult season or promote more accurate projections. Indeed, it runs the risk of alienating them from the process as we can\'t predict the weather, or in a summer like this, maintain expected production.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGGHSpLZ2nwuNyk2AQ7fMHK5k4SYg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=x6eOWYDxBMiJW_b_ofgN&url=http://www.thescottishfarmer.co.uk/news/15463833.Bad_weather_hits_milk_production/,EN,,12/08/2017 07:01,2017-08-11 07:09:11+00:00,7d4afbc755,The Scottish Farmer,,,,,1502442551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ff1b54f304,"Vote early, vote often: 19 rigged elections in popular culture - A.V. Club","19 rigged elections in popular culture · Inventory · The A.V. Club<br />Steeped as we are in this election year, with dire consequences at stake, you can see how some people might consider thwarting the democratic process in favor of ensuring their desired result. Not that we would ever advocate doing that (ever!). But those looking to skew democracy can find more than a few pop-culture examples for inspiration, through old-fashioned intimidation, new-fashioned technology, and getting dead people to vote.1. The Simpsons[1]: Sideshow Bob wins with the votes of the deceasedThe so-­called Republican Revolution hit Springfield first. Nearly a month before conservative candidates drubbed their Democratic competition in the 1994 midterm elections, The Simpsons\' Sideshow Bob rode a wave[2] of pandering and radio talk-­jock bluster into the office previously occupied by \""Diamond Joe\"" Quimby. But Mayor Terwilliger didn\'t exactly follow the Contract With America to the letter: In a manner befitting a disgruntled second banana­ turned homicidal maniac, Bob builds his impressive win on the backs of the dead. After Sideshow Bob\'s eternal nemeses Bart and Lisa Simpson suspect fraud at the polls, they discover that several people who \""voted\"" for the new mayor were six feet under on election day. And it wasn\'t just people, either: To the horror of true-blue liberal Lisa, one of the fraudulent votes is attributed to her late cat, Snowball I. Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 8. The fraud\'s run of the mill, but the motivation\'s downright tyrannical. Per Bob\'s self-incriminating rant: \""I did this to protect you from yourselves!\"" [Erik Adams]2. Seinfeld[3]: A puppet regime, bribesMorty Seinfeld\'s (Barney Martin) tenure as tenants\' board president was cut short by scandal in season seven, after Jerry\'s gift of a brand-new Cadillac raised questions of mismanagement of the organization\'s funds. But Kramer\'s relocation to Del Boca Vista in season nine presents Morty with a way back into office-once he sees how popular Cosmo was with his elderly neighbors, Morty hatches a scheme to install him as a figurehead. But when another scandal threatens to destroy Kramer\'s candidacy, the two men resort to bribing the constituents with knockoff gadgets that are prized for their tip calculators. Naturally, that plan goes awry, too, after the \""Willards\"" are found to be defective-not only are some missing various alphanumeric keys, but their calculations lead the Del Boca Vista residents to overtip the staff. Kramer is run out of town, while Morty must face disgrace alone. If only he\'d tried to access the Wizard\'s other features.Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 9. The bribery and the figurehead are bad enough in their own right, but deploying them together to win a fairly low-stakes tenants\' board election shows a complete lack of respect for the democratic process. [Danette Chavez]3. Battlestar Galactica[4]: Manipulated election between Roslin and BaltarStealing elections is something the bad guys are supposed to do. Good guys believe in democracy; one person, one vote, and the will of the people. But Battlestar Galactica was never much interested in simple answers. When Laura Roslin runs for president against Gaius Baltar, the choice should be obvious: Roslin is a brilliant, bold leader who held together the remains of humanity in the aftermath of the Cylon apocalypse; Baltar is a spineless gadabout who inadvertently helped bring about that apocalypse. But when Baltar starts pulling ahead in the polls, Roslin supporters take steps to make sure she wins regardless of how the votes turn out. It\'s a classic BSG dilemma: Break the rules and get the better result, or do things the hard way and face the consequences. Roslin opts for the latter and loses the election, and things turn out horribly for everyone. Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 3. Roslin ultimately upholds the principles of the democratic state at great cost to herself; too bad Baltar\'s ineptitude as a leader calls the value of those principles into question. [Zack Handlen]4. Election[5]: Two stolen votes Alexander Payne\'s 1999 movie Election uses a high school election to translate certain life lessons. Super-ambitious high school student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon in her best-ever performance) draws ire from her stuck-in-dissatisfaction teacher Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick). As Tracy runs unopposed for student body president, Mr. McAllister even drafts popular lunkheaded football player Paul (Chris Klein) to run against her. Despite all his efforts-as well as a rogue third candidate, Paul\'s anarchist sister-Tracy wins the election by a single vote. As the faculty advisor, Mr. McAllister performs the vote audit, and in a moment of rage against Tracy always apparently getting whatever she wants unscathed, he throws away two of the votes, giving the election to his candidate. Within this narrow arena, Payne manages to paint a canvas of ambition versus jealousy, exploring our reactions to not just our positions in life, but how we let other people\'s positions affect us. In the end, McAllister is a museum docent, and Tracy a congressional aide, so he throws a milkshake at her, still desperate to even the score. Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 8, for squashing the electoral ideals of teenagers. If a high school civics teacher is this corrupt, what chance does anyone else have? [Gwen Ihnat]5. Parks And Recreation[6]: Very suggestive voting machinesWhile Sweetums heir and all-around doofus Bobby Newport (Paul Rudd) doesn\'t have a conniving bone in his body, he hires ruthless political wiz Jen Barkley (Kathryn Hahn) to do the dirty work of running and winning the campaign for city council. So when, in the 11th hour, the eminently better-qualified civil servant Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) and her boyfriend/campaign manager Ben (Adam Scott) discover Sweetums-branded voting machines being installed in some precincts, they challenge them as an obvious accost to democracy. These machines say \""Good choice!\"" when a vote for Bobby is cast, then spit out a voucher for a free Sweetums candy bar; a vote for Leslie, on the other hand, results in a loud noise used on game shows to designate a wrong answer. Confirming a vote for Leslie results in the cartoon Sweetums girl crying and the machine asking if you\'d like to vote for someone better. Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 6. The attempt didn\'t work, but had the machines been installed, it\'s safe to assume Pawnee\'s notoriously fickle citizens would have gone with their sugar-happy guts and voted for Bobby. [Caitlin PenzeyMoog]6. Gangs Of New York[7]: Get a shave, vote againWhile Martin Scorsese\'s Gangs Of New York was a mostly fictionalized look at a real historical era, it did draw from actual fact at certain moments. Case in point: the \""Election Day\"" sequence of the movie, when Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz\'s characters help rally the residents of the Bowery to vote time and time again. Already voted that day? So what? Shave that beard and get back in line. Too hopped up on opium to know it\'s voting day? Bill The Butcher\'s political machine will make sure you\'re awake and voting for them, then handsomely compensate you for your effort, whether with drink or with coin. While the Gangs sequence certainly benefits from a frantic cut and Sousa-infused soundtrack, it\'s not entirely inaccurate. All of those tactics and more were documented in the literature that actually inspired Gangs, including Herbert Asbury\'s 1928 book of the same name. Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 4. Sure, it\'s shady, but it actually happened. Plus, at least those guys got a free shave and a beer or two out of the whole debacle. [Marah Eakin]7. Orange Is The New Black[8]: Piper gets elected inmate rep without even being nominatedThe women of Litchfield Penitentiary are already functionally powerless, so it only adds insult to injury when one of their few outlets of self-determination-the choice of who\'ll represent them on the prison\'s Women\'s Advisory Council-gets taken away. Sidestepping the fact that the group is little more than a social club for figureheads seeking to aid their own self-interests, or that the elections are voluntarily segregated along racial and factional lines, the elections to the WAC are also overtly corrupt. That\'s because their organizer, Counselor Healy (Michael Harney), isn\'t looking to put together a representative body of reformers; he just wants people who\'ll be quiet when he tosses them some donuts, and tells them to close their mouths. To that end, he stuffs the \""white inmate\"" ballot for protagonist (and ostensible good girl) Piper Chapman, little aware that he\'s bringing one of Litchfield\'s most persistent thorns into his ill-fated little inner circle.Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 9. Nobody-including the person it supposedly benefits-has any control over the outcome of the WAC elections, except for the sad little man in charge. [William Hughes]8-10. Carrie[9], Gossip Girl[10], Mean Girls[11]: Rigged prom-queen electionsThere are quite a few high-stakes elections on this list, but there may be none as cutthroat as the hunt for prom queen. Some prom elections are rigged for nefarious purposes. Poor Carrie White thought she became prom queen after a life of abuse and bullying both at home and at school in Brian De Palma\'s adaptation of the Stephen King classic Carrie. Little did she know a group of high school mean girls gave her the crown so they could drench her in pig\'s blood, creating one of cinema\'s most iconic scenes. But she got hers, didn\'t she? Sometimes, and these are the best times, the prom-queen rigging is out of love. Chuck Bass, for instance, made sure that Blair Waldorf took the crown by removing the ballots of her bitter rival in Gossip Girl, while Damian made sure that his buddy Janis Ian was in the running for Spring Fling Queen in Mean Girls. She lost out to Cady Heron, but who wants two gift certificates to Walker Brothers Pancake House anyway?Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 7. Some of these got way too extreme for a prom queen election, a reign that primarily lasts one evening, after all. [Molly Eichel]11. Scandal[12]: The corrupted voting machine of Defiance County, OhioScandal\'s Olivia Pope was not alone in her quest to get Fitzgerald Grant elected president. Hollis Doyle, Cyrus Beene, even Supreme Court Justice Verna Thornton, and Fitz\'s own wife, Mellie, were in on a giant conspiracy to get their candidate to the White House no matter what. Curiously, a close election came down to Defiance County, Ohio, where the sinister group sweetened tallies by using a voting machine rigged to automatically swing the votes in Grant\'s favor. Although Cyrus\' husband, snoopy reporter James, finally uncovered the corrupted voting machine, he was quickly bought off with the baby he wanted, so he quit his job to stay home with Ella. Nevertheless, the long shadow of Defiance is cast over the show to this day, years later: Fitz had to run for reelection because he felt like he wasn\'t fairly elected the first time (and he wasn\'t). The president killed a dying Verna just as she was about to spill the beans. Olivia and Fitz never really got over their trust issues. Nowadays all someone has to do is mention \""Defiance\"" on that show for everyone to start falling apart.Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 10. A balloting machine that does the exact opposite of what the voters intend is egregious to say the least. This is why this show favors the word \""republic\"" over \""democracy.\"" [Gwen Ihnat]12. Black Sheep: Day of the dead (voters)It\'s one of the oldest tricks in American electoral skullduggery: Net yourself a victory by getting a bunch of people who currently reside six feet under to cast a ballot in your favor. That\'s the scheme at the heart of Black Sheep, the 1996 comedy in which Chris Farley\'s dimwitted Mike Donnelly tries his best to help the campaign of his brother Al (Tim Matheson) as he runs for governor of Washington. Unfortunately, his bumbling efforts do more harm than good, even under the watchful eye of campaign aide Steve Dodds (David Spade), so he eventually gets shipped out to the woods to pass the time until election day. But it\'s too late, and rival candidate Governor Tracy wins. But as Mike watches the returns, he notices something amiss: Garfield County delivered more votes for Tracy than there are registered voters. Thanks to some quick thinking-well, fake hostage-taking, really-Mike saves the day, his brother is elected, and the audience accepts that this will not be as funny as Tommy Boy.Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 7. It\'s pretty bad to commit outright fraud like this, but then again, we all have family members casting votes for people that imply your relatives may well be brain-dead already. [Alex McCown]13. The Good Wife[13]: Rigged state\'s attorney electionOne of the great villains of The Good Wife was an unexpected one: the Illinois Democratic Party. When Alicia is accused of stealing the election for the state\'s attorney, it\'s not because of her own doing, but because of machinations of her party\'s chairman. After Alicia fights a hard battle against Frank Prady (David Hyde Pierce), her dreams of political power are squashed when the ugly accusations come out. She\'s even defended by civil rights bigwig Spencer Randolph (Ron Rifkin), but that\'s not enough. Turns out, the election wasn\'t rigged for her, but for another state senate candidate as a way to keep the Democratic super majority in the Illinois House. Alicia just so happens to be collateral damage. When she decides to fight back, not even Randolph is on her side. The party tries to placate Alicia with a spot on the gaming board, but she essentially tells them to fuck off and keep their sinecure position. Hey, maybe she should have taken the gig? It could have led to a better seventh season. Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 1. As usual on The Good Wife, Alicia is blameless. [Molly Eichel]14. Boardwalk Empire[14]: Running the entire townAt the start of Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi) is at the height of his political powers, using his position as Atlantic City treasurer to smoothly run the political machine. Said powers are given a full workout in the season-one finale \""A Return To Normalcy[15],\"" as the 1920 election threatens to break the Republican grip. Nucky\'s machine pulls out all of the stops to hang on: promising drinks and jobs in exchange for votes, stuffing ballot boxes with dead people who are still registered, and cutting deals with Chalky White (Michael Kenneth Williams) to secure the city\'s large black vote. It still looks close, until Nucky finds a brilliant 11th-hour move to answer Democratic charges of corruption. He cuts a deal with Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg) to end their war, and in a press conference one day before the election, he frames the results of that peace accord as proof of his administration\'s focus on law and order. The move keeps the city in his party\'s hands, but his success turns out to be short-lived: In the next season, his enemies find the silver lining to his trickery and have him arrested for election fraud.Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 7. Despite being business as usual for Atlantic City, it\'s still the dirtiest of business. [Les Chappell]15. Justified[16]: Anti-nepotism lawsSeason three of Justified sees the world of Harlan County shaken up by an outsider, Detroit gangster Robert Quarles (Neal McDonough). Confident that he could mold the county into his own drug empire, he moves to keep Sheriff Napier (David Andrews) in his pocket and on the job, aiming to kneecap the operations of Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins). However, when it comes to understanding how elections are won in Harlan, Boyd has the upper hand. He stirs up the crowd at debates and gets his prostitution ring to trade sexual favors for votes, and when Napier still manages to pull out a victory, he outflanks the opposition thanks to his knowledge of county law. Prior to the election, he cut a deal with the county clerk to get Napier\'s sister a job with the sheriff\'s department, a development that leaves Napier subject to anti-nepotism laws even though he was entirely unaware of it. The laws mean that another election must be held, and until then Boyd\'s candidate, Shelby (Jim Beaver), takes the office. It\'s the season\'s theme laid bare: You can bring in your big-city charm and money, but it\'s no match for home advantage. Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 3. Boyd pulls an underhanded trick, but one that\'s technically still within the boundaries of the law. [Les Chappell]16. Skins: Votes hidden in braIn the third volume of the British series Skins, episode three follows Naomi (Lily Loveless) and her run for student class president. Her strongest opponent, James Cook (Jack O\'Connell), is the class-clown type, banking on his popularity and good looks to win over the student body. Naomi, on the other hand, enters politics hoping to make a difference. So, she\'s especially disheartened to discover two of her teachers rigging the election in her favor in an attempt to ensure shit actually gets done around the school. It\'s especially upsetting, though completely in line with Skins\' racy nature, that all of Cook\'s votes vanish into a female faculty member\'s bra. Later, when it\'s announced Naomi wins, she blows the lid off of the conspiracy, pulling the votes out of the bra and proving that Cook has actually won over his classmates. In celebration, the students riot.Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 8, for squashing the electoral ideals of teenagers again. Why can\'t these teachers just leave them kids alone? [Becca James]17. Blackadder[17]: \""And thirdly, we\'ll cheat.\""The third series of historical Britcom Blackadder sees Rowan Atkinson\'s titular schemer as butler to idiotic Prince George IV (Hugh Laurie). In \""Dish And Dishonesty,\"" Parliament is deadlocked over whether to suspend George\'s allowance before he can fritter away any more of the crown\'s money. To swing the vote, Blackadder resolves to win a vacant seat in Parliament the only way he knows how: cheating like mad. First he finds a \""rotten borough\"" that has one M.P. representing only one citizen. Then he steps in as election supervisor after the previous one \""accidentally\"" stabs himself to death while shaving. Come election day, the borough\'s lone voter has \""accidentally\"" cut his own head off while combing his hair, and he\'s replaced by... Blackadder. After all that, Blackadder\'s chosen candidate wins, only to vote against the Prince Regent by mistake.Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 10. The reason Blackadder\'s satire works so well is that there isn\'t even a pretense that the election is fair or that the will of the people matters in the face of the monarchy\'s pettiest whims. [Mike Vago]18. The First Law Trilogy: Magical manipulationsJoe Abercombie is often compared with George R.R. Martin, due to both authors\' cynical, low-fantasy settings. But Abercrombie\'s books contain an extra measure of pitch-black nihilism that\'s all the more depressing for feeling like a very accurate depiction of human nature, regardless of the presence of magic in the world. His First Law Trilogy is essentially a deconstructed Lord Of The Rings, with an eclectic group of adventurers seeking a great relic. But Bayaz, the book\'s Gandalf stand-in, is no selfless mentor. An ageless wizard who derives at least some of his powers from cannibalism, he uses his magic less to gently guide than to outright manipulate. The quest was a smokescreen used in part to position the selfish nobleman Jezal Dan Luthar as a king of The Union, a puppet ruler for Bayaz to control. Bayaz uses his magic to grant Jezal victory in a pivotal sword-fighting tournament, broker a treaty with an escalating rebellion, and even to manipulate Luthar\'s family into believing he was descended from the royal line. Jezal grew over the course of his journey, becoming wiser and more humble. But it was too late for him to realize that he was being railroaded into a political position he did not want and is now trapped in.Desecration of democracy on a scale of 1 to 10: 4. Plutocratic monarchies already do a fine job of desecrating democracy even without being tampered with. But this one deserves points for sheer scope. [Nick Wanserski]19. The Prisoner[18]: The entire election is a scamAt their most basic level, rigged elections indicate a certain faith in the process. After all, if voting is meaningless, why bother manipulating the results? The Prisoner goes one step further. When elections are held in the Village-a surreal small town where former spies and government officials are kept in genial captivity-Number Six gets involved, if only for a chance to meet the elusive Number One. Six wins the election, in a landslide whose veracity is debatable, and then learns the truth that\'s most likely obvious to anyone familiar with the series: The will of the electorate is a moot symbol, and all his efforts bring him no closer to achieving his goals. Democracy is just another ruse. Voting is just a way to give the illusion of control to those who will never have it; those with power keep it, and those without end up right back where they started.

ff24b230cc,Hillary Clinton blasts Trump on women\'s issues - KSDK.com,"Clinton touts women\'s issues, blasts Trump at Planned Parenthood event<br />Heidi M Przybyla, USA TODAY <br />2:17 PM. CDT June 10, 2016<br />WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton said Friday Republicans, led by Donald Trump, are looking to \""turn back the clock\"" on women\'s health care advances, including access to contraception and safe abortions, in her first major policy address since becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.Speaking to the Planned Parenthood Action Network in Washington, Clinton said U.S. abortion and pregnancy rates are at record lows due to access to contraception and sex education, services offered by the women\'s reproductive rights group that is a target of Republicans in Congress and state legislatures across the nation.\""It wasn\'t so long ago that Democrats and Republicans actually stood together on these issues,\"" said Clinton, speaking in a ballroom illuminated in neon pink. \""Things feel quite different now,\"" she said, citing an upcoming Supreme Court case on Texas abortion laws, which she described as the \""biggest challenge to Roe v. Wade in a generation.\""She also pointed to hundreds of new state-level abortion restrictions imposed by Republican-led legislatures and the fact that 11 states have defunded Planned Parenthood in the past year, cutting some women off from their only health care access.\""When Donald Trump says \'Let\'s make America great again,\' that is code for let\'s take America backward, back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some\"" but not all, and when abortion was illegal, women had few options and life for women \""was limited,\"" she said. \""Well, Donald, those days are over,\"" she said.Clinton\'s attacks on Trump - in her first speech since securing the endorsement of President Obama on Thursday - continued the same focus on progressive and women\'s issues that she emphasized during the primary.It\'s a message to liberals in her party that she\'ll maintain her commitment to those issues, even as she seeks to court independent and moderate Republican voters.In her speech, Clinton warned that, as president, Trump would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, defund Planned Parenthood and go after \""so many of the fundamental rights we have, including safe and legal abortion.\"" She cited comments Trump made in an MSNBC interview, which he later walked back, that women should be punished for having abortion.\""That\'s someone who doesn\'t hold women in high regard, because if he did, he would trust women to make the right decisions\"" for their bodies, she said. \""This is a man who has called women pigs, dogs and disgusting animals,\"" said Clinton. \""Donald Trump has shown us who he is and we sure should believe him,\"" she said.Clinton cast the entire Republican Party as hostile to women. \""Have you ever noticed that\"" the same politicians who are against abortion are \""also against policies that would make it easier to raise a child, like paid family leave?\""\""They are for limited government everywhere except when it comes to women\'s rights and choices,\"" she said. \""We\'re in the middle of a concerted, persistent assault on women\'s health across the country,\"" she added. \""Do we want to put our health, our lives and our futures in Donald Trump\'s hands?\""Clinton\'s speech focused primarily on abortion and women\'s health services, which account for the majority of Planned Parenthood\'s services.It was delivered shortly before Trump gave a speech nearby in Washington in which he blasted the presumptive Democratic nominee.Earlier, Clinton met with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who delivered a blistering attack on Trump Thursday night before endorsing Clinton. Warren, a high-profile, anti-Wall Street firebrand in the Senate, has also been mentioned as a potential vice presidential pick.Clinton is counting on a strong turnout among female voters, including young and old, and even some moderate Republicans and independents to create a winning coalition. Clinton has a 51% favorability among women, according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, while 47% have an unfavorable view of her. Meanwhile, Trump\'s unfavorable rating is 67%.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFECJQlssZ5RoWmUbGiUshka1B-Fw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779129199048&ei=JaBjV5inGuG9zAaA9JKACw&url=http://www.ksdk.com/news/nation-now/clinton-touts-womens-issues-blasts-trump-at-planned-parenthood-event/238932280,EN,,17/06/2016 07:09,2016-06-10 16:08:20+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,KSDK.com,,,,,1465582100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ff4a34741f,Life-changing experience for Tavistock nurse in Kenya | News ... - Okehampton Times,"Life-changing experience for Tavistock nurse in Kenya | News<br />POVERTY, malnutrition and leprosy were just some of the ailments encountered by a Tavistock nurse who recently volunteered her medical services in rural Kenya.<br />Practice nurse and team leader at Abbey Surgery Emma Banks spent two weeks in Tsarvo, in rural south west Kenya, with the charity, Camps International, along with a team of other UK medical professionals, to provide medical support to Kenyan doctors and nurses during a number of temporary clinics set up by the charity in different areas.In the rural areas of Kenya, people travel miles to visit these types of \'pop-up\' clinics as usually they would have to travel to the nearest city hospital and pay to see a nurse, which many can\'t afford to do.Emma said around 400 plus patients came through the doors of their make-shift clinics each day - sometimes more, working non-stop for 12 hours a day.She said: \'You just can\'t describe the poverty over there. We arrived in Tsarvo, which was really rural - you think of Devon as rural but this was something else. We were put up in a specially made camp of straw huts but had proper beds - it was a bit like glamping. Over the first couple of days we met up with the local Kenyan teams and went to their workplace and saw the labour room - I would say it was like the days of the programme Call the Midwife - there were buckets to sterilise things and a couch and that was it.\'All the clinics were advertised through word of mouth and local surgeries and we were invariably setting up the clinics in schools. We had a tent shelter as a reception area and we swept the mud floors and rearranged all the bench desks for consultation areas. We had it as hygienic as possible with the resources we had.\'Emma said her aim before she went out was to become an independent consulter - undertaking patient consultations on her own rather than shadowing someone - which she achieved a few days into the clinics.\'After my first day of shadowing someone I was thinking I was completely out of my depth and on the second day I didn\'t feel any better. I had to leave my UK head at home and think outside of the box. Malaria and TB were the big things to look for, which aren\'t that common in the UK. By the third clinic I was put with a highly experienced UK nurse practitioner who was a newbie to the camp. We did one consultation together and then she said I\'d be fine on my own. I was quite chuffed but typically for the rest of the afternoon I had lots of complicated cases.\'On one of the days I had a lady come in with what I thought was leprosy. I asked the Kenyan nurses who weren\'t sure so I had another UK nurse examine her who also confirmed it. The lady\'s hands were seriously deformed and swollen with white lesions on the skin. Her eyes didn\'t look right either - one of her eyes wouldn\'t close properly, which are all classic signs. Apparently she got it three years ago after the birth of her child and she hadn\'t done anything about it.\'Emma said she also saw a lot of cases of people who had arthritis through years of hard work, a lot of people with stomach pains predominantly from malnutrition as many she saw were only eating two meals a day and two cups of water. One lady was treated for a dislocated shoulder from carrying huge barrels of water.Emma was grateful for all the donations of both equipment and money she received form the people of Tavistock before she went out.\'The people of Tavistock, through Abbey Surgery, donated £518 over a three-week period which was phenomenal,\' she said.The money raised by Emma and the other UK medics was divided between different causes, including a local women\'s group which aims to empower women to work and bank their own money so that it is safe for them to use for their children\'s schoolbooks and equipment, rather than taken by their husbands and spent on alcohol. Money was given towards cataracts operations and cervical screening and some was donated to a project set up by a local nurse to build a small well.Emma also managed to get the team to agree to give some money to a patient she saw at one of the clinics.She said: \'It was really sad, but on our last day this most dishevelled man came in who thought his testicle had gone up into his body, but what he showed me was a hernia. He had been to the hospital, which was more than an hour away and had been advised to have surgery. He was a welder, was divorced and had three kids under 10 to look after. It transpired that he had a herd of cows which he wanted to sell to get the money for the surgery, but he wasn\'t fit enough, so his brother took them to market for him but never gave him the money - he took everything he had. He could no longer work, he had no money and he was living off food provided by his other brother to survive. The other nurses and I agreed that we would pay for him to be operated on.\'Emma said her time in Kenya was very emotional but was an experience she would never forget.\'It was very sad. We had to think on our feet as we didn\'t have all the equipment we were used to, we only had a basic kit. It was like picking up a GP surgery without the doctors and putting it in a very rural environment.\'It was great seeing the teams, who didn\'t know each other, working together - crying, laughing and learning from each other. It was worth every minute. Anyone can do it, you don\'t have to be a medic. Whatever your background, we can all wash feet, sterilise instruments and train how to do a sight test. They take lots of non medics on the camps. I would urge anyone to give something like this a go. I was out of my comfort zone 100 per cent of the time but it is something we can all do.\'I have to say a huge thank you to everyone for their donations. We all took nearly 56 kilos of donations over each. It was unbelievable.

Brown and Associates and Higgerty Law say they\'re seeking damages from Smucker Foods of Canada Corp. following a national recall of 10-kilogram bags of Robin Hood Original All Purpose Flour.<br />A statement of claim says the representative plaintiff lives in Victoria, B.C., and became so sick after eating cookie dough that her kidneys began shutting down.<br />The Canadian Food Inspection Agency issued a recall in Western Canada for the flour late last month, and the Public Health Agency of Canada says an outbreak of E. coli O121 has been linked to the flour.<br />Bags of Robin Hood flour have been linked to illnesses from E. coli. (Photo: Canadian Food Inspection Agency)<br />The health agency says there have been 26 cases of people being infected with the bacteria in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador.<br />No deaths have been reported, but at least six people required hospital care.<br />The recall applies to flour with a best-before date of April 17, 2018 (2018 AL 17) and the production code 6 291 548.<br />No one from the company could be immediately reached for comment about the lawsuit.<br />Recalled flour came from mill in Saskatoon<br />A spokeswoman for the J.M. Smucker Co., Maribeth Burns, said last week that the recalled flour was produced at a mill in Saskatoon.<br />Burns said consumers should note public health warnings not to taste raw dough or batter and that eating a small amount could make people sick.<br />The lawsuit claims the company breached its duty to safely manufacture goods. It alleges the company was negligent by failing to test its flour thoroughly, and that it failed to recall the tainted flour immediately upon learning people were becoming ill.<br />It also says the company failed to adopt technological advances in laboratory testing for flour, lacked adequate procedures for cleaning equipment and didn\'t train staff properly for food handling.<br />The best-before date on affected bags. (Photo: Canadian Food Inspection Agency)<br />None of the allegations has been proven in court.<br />The lawsuit says it seeks compensation for physical and emotional injury and lost wages. It also seeks a refund for consumers who bought the flour.<br />Food contaminated with E. coli may not look or smell spoiled, but can still make people sick. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, mild to severe abdominal cramps and watery to bloody diarrhea.<br />The bacteria can be found in the lower intestines of animals and people.<br />The food agency said it is investigating the source of the E. coli.<br />Suggest a correction[1]<br />References^ Suggest a correction (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHpXcnqa-5K7-9K7L0lpvNp3MO25g&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779459304592&ei=LhtKWfiZFMj0W9SrjPAO&url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/04/12/robin-hood-flour-lawsuit_n_15968022.html,EN,,21/06/2017 07:07,2017-04-12 17:37:23+00:00,a3eed62f3b,Huffington Post Canada,,,,,1492025843,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8a5c6ceb8d,Research to study effects of topsoil exposure on swine gut microbiome - Feedstuffs,"Research to study effects of topsoil exposure on swine gut microbiome<br />A University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture researcher\'s efforts to understand how exposure to topsoil affects the gut microbiome and feed efficiency in pigs have earned him a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.<br />The grant from USDA\'s National Institute for Food & Agriculture was awarded to Jiangchao Zhao, assistant professor of animal science at the university\'s Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food & Life Sciences and researcher for the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station.<br />Zhao\'s proposal focused on the underlying mechanisms of topsoil exposure in early life that changes the swine gut microbiome and increases postweaning feed efficiency, the announcement said.<br />\""The switch from outdoor rearing to indoor rearing increased the profit for swine producers but decreased the pig\'s chance to be exposed to the environment, which likely led to the decrease in swine gut microbial diversity,\"" Zhao said. \""Since the gut microbiome plays important roles in almost every aspect of animal health and nutrition, such a decrease in gut microbiome diversity is likely associated with the high morbidity and mortality rates in some modern farms.<br />\""This is similar to the human modernization process,\"" he said. \""When humans move to big cities, increase antibiotic intake and decrease bacteria exposure, they have been losing many important bacterial species, which have been associated with increased chronic diseases.\""<br />To provide the pigs with exposure to an outdoor environment, the project incorporated a novel topsoil exposure model mimicking such an environment.<br />\""Piglets exposed to top soil during lactation had significantly greater gut microbiome diversity, followed by remarkable improvement in growth performance and feed efficiency postweaning,\"" Zhao said. \""We hypothesize that this short-term topsoil exposure improves feed efficiency through modulation of the gut microbiome.<br />\""We are working to identify the beneficial bacteria enriched by topsoil exposure that will decrease postweaning stress levels and increase feed efficiency,\"" Zhao added.<br />Feed costs account for 60-70% of swine production, precipitating the need for and relevance of studies looking into increasing feed efficiency. The necessity for this study pushed up Zhao\'s proposal to be ranked fourth out of 100 proposals.<br />The $500,000 award will fund Zhao\'s research study for four years.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNG13Zme9TcyTm80DB--GYxie9Kv9A&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52780056921020&ei=uPi-W6DjE9bWzAaaz57ABQ&url=https://www.feedstuffs.com/nutrition-health/research-study-effects-topsoil-exposure-swine-gut-microbiome,EN,,11/10/2018 07:15,2018-10-02 23:48:37+00:00,a83cc6376b,Feedstuffs,,,,,1538531317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The state has granted a Baker County rancher\'s request to kill wolves involved in livestock attacks. <br />HALFWAY - Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has killed one of a pack of eight wolves preying on livestock in Baker County.The action was taken under a permit granted to a Baker County cattle rancher whose livestock has been repeatedly attacked on private grazing ground.According to an ODFW press release, the agency provided a kill permit to allow the taking of two wolves. Under the terms of this permit, the producer can kill up to two wolves on the private property he leases where the depredations occurred, when his livestock is present on the property. The permit expires on May 4. ODFW staff members were also authorized to kill the wolves.On Tuesday, ODFW staff - who were already in the area hazing wolves - shot and killed one uncollared yearling female from the Pine Creek pack on private land where the previous depredations had occurred.The rancher had requested that the state kill all eight wolves in the Pine Creek pack, but the state is using what it calls incremental take - authorizing the lethal removal of two wolves in an attempt to change the wolf pack\'s behavior.OR-50 is the breeding male of the pack, a wolf involved in repeated kills in Wallowa County last year when he was a member of the Harl Butte Pack.According to George Rollins, Oregon Cattlemen\'s Association wolf committee co-chaiman, rancher Chad Delcurto turned out 130 cow and calf pairs into a private pasture Wednesday, April 4. The cattle were held overnight in a corral so the mothers and calves could find each other in a safe enclosure.On Thursday, the cow/calf pairs were driven up from the corrals to higher ground. Rollins said the cattle were held to make sure they paired up again. There were no wolf sightings that afternoon, yet the next day an employee of Pine Valley Ranch was scouting for a hunting trip and saw wolves chasing and attacking Delcurto\'s cattle.\""He (ranch employee) ran to them, video taped them and then contacted everyone he could to get in touch with Chad,\"" Rollins said.Delcurto assembled a crew on horseback to check the cattle. The horseback riders rode into the middle of wolves among the cattle and attempted to chase the predators away. While checking the herd the horseback crew found two dead calves approximately one mile apart from each other. Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife staff in Baker County as well as Baker County Sheriff Travis Ash and Deputy Rob Adams performed an investigation.\""A picture was taken of a cow standing over her dead calf with wolves 20 feet away,\"" Rollins said.Rollins said another crew was assembled April 7 to gather the entire herd and determine if there were any further losses. During the gathering the horseback riders discovered wolves attacking another calf.\""Riders harassed the wolves (five wolves were visible at the site) and drove them over the ridge west of where the attack took place,\"" Rollins said.The calf had significant bites with visible open wounds on both rear legs. Rollins said it was unable to travel and was left behind with his mother who was also showing lameness. At the corrals, 130 cows were counted and 124 calves, including the pair left on the hillside. Four of those calves showed visible wounds on their rear legs and hindquarters. The calf left on the hillside was later euthanized and the carcass investigated. Again, wolves were seen in close proximity during the investigation.\""So at this point Chad had three calves confirmed killed, four confirmed injured and three missing in 48 hours,\"" Rollins said. \""If you total that up, sold as 550 pound calves, that\'s a $10,000 loss.\""According to Michelle Dennehy of Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, OR-50 moved into the Pine Creek Wildlife Unit in Baker County last fall and joined up with a female wolf, OR-36.Rollins said there have been regular sightings of wolves within 400 yards of the Pine Valley Ranch shop outside of Halfway where he recently retired as manager. Fish and Wildlife biologists have repeatedly hazed wolves away from the ranch headquarters.\""The ODFW guys have done a remarkable job hazing - they were concerned there would be depredations in the spring time,\"" Rollins said. \""They ran wolves probably 20 miles with helicopters back into the forest to the Imnaha River again and that lasted about 36 hours.\""In the next few days Rollins said eight more producers are getting set to turn out cattle in the low hills where Delcurto\'s cattle are grazing.<br />Marketplace[1]<br />Our Guidelines<br />Stay on topic - This helps keep the thread focused on the discussion at hand.

8a5c6606a7,Swine farm biosecurity even more important in winter months - Sampson Independent,"Sampson Independent | Swine farm biosecurity even more important in winter months<br />The health and well-being of the swine that farmers care for on a daily basis is their number one on-farm priority. The spread of infectious diseases and viruses results in decreased production on the farm and increased mortality which diminishes the bottom dollar for farmers and also increases their workload. Generally, bacteria can survive longer in a cooler environment which creates an easier field for the spread of infectious diseases and viruses. Therefore, farm biosecurity is even more important during winter months.<br />Highlighted below are some of the important biosecurity measures that should be used by farmers year-round. Proper implementation of external and internal biosecurity practices is vital, especially during winter months.<br />· Vehicle movement from farm to farm presents a major opportunity for the transmission of an infectious disease or virus. Producers are wise to take every precaution concerning all vehicles entering their farm and ask that they be thoroughly washed, cleaned, and disinfected before entering.<br />· Anytime new swine arrives at a facility, there is a risk of transmission of an infectious disease or virus. New swine arriving should be quarantined immediately. Producers should only accept swine from a reliable source that can validate their health. Once the swine have been quarantined, producers have the opportunity to assess their health for themselves and make necessary adjustments. Most producers in North Carolina receive swine from minimal sources and have complete knowledge of their origin; however, this does not lessen the farmer\'s responsibility for monitoring their health.<br />· Physical barriers prove to offer a notable defense against infectious diseases and viruses. Swine facility locations with open sides should consider the addition of physical barriers. They can assist in minimizing on-farm rodents, human traffic, and wild animals such as feral hogs. There is a growing number of species of animals that have the capability of becoming contaminated with viruses and infectious diseases that can in turn spread to swine.<br />· Lastly and probably most importantly, is reducing the number of visitors to your swine facility to a bare minimum. When visitors must come, they should be given and follow specific instructions concerning entry and producers must make sure the instructions are followed.<br />Having biosecurity policies in place is very important, but what is more important is how consistently they are carried out on a daily basis on the farm. Farmers will strengthen the health of their animals and the swine industry as a whole if biosecurity is a top priority each and every day.<br />Max Knowles<br />Max Knowles is an extension agent specializing in livestock with the Sampson County Cooperative Extension Center.

8a581b37fc,Dog Flu: Why It\'s Smart to Vaccinate Your Pet Now - Healthline,"Dog Flu: Why It\'s Smart to Vaccinate Your Pet Now<br />Here\'s everything you need to know about the highly contagious dog flu and how to protect your pet this season. Photo: Getty ImagesIn January 2004, a pack of greyhounds at a Florida racetrack fell mysteriously ill. They all showed signs of some kind of respiratory distress: coughing, fever, and runny noses. The symptoms could easily be mistaken for \""kennel cough,\"" a disease caused by the bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica. But, it soon became obvious that this particular group of dogs wasn\'t suffering from a simple case of kennel cough. In total, 8 of the 24 infected dogs eventually died while researchers zeroed in on the culprit. What they found wasn\'t some new disease. It was the flu. Veterinary scientists discovered that the dogs had been infected with an influenza A virus of equine origin - this flu came from horses. The racetrack where the dogs fell ill also happened to host horse racing. This particular strain of influenza, H3N8, had apparently made the jump to a new host species. The flu\'s ability to do so isn\'t uncommon. It\'s known to exist in many different variations in many different species, including birds, pigs, and humans. However, this incident was the first time that the flu was isolated in canines. Dogs were often considered \""refractory,\"" or resistant, to influenza, but no longer. That outbreak, the first known of its kind, eventually spread to racing greyhounds in nine different states between 2004 and 2006. Canine influenza has since spread throughout the United States, sporadically flaring up from year to year. In 2018, the dog flu appears to have reared its head again: Over 100 cases have been reported in Michigan. Nearby Wisconsin has also reported recent cases, as have a handful of states on the East Coast, including Massachusetts, Virginia, and Connecticut. It\'s garnered headlines from nationally syndicated news media, saying that a mysterious, highly contagious disease is spreading, feeding into the fear of a new doggie epidemic. But pet owners shouldn\'t panic \""There\'s a lot of hype and hysteria,\"" said John de Jong, DVM, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). \""It\'s not much worse than any previous time. The AVMA wants to make sure that pet owners realize there\'s nothing to panic about at this time. We see outbreaks like this flare up from time to time.\"" American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). \""It\'s not much worse than any previous time. The AVMA wants to make sure that pet owners realize there\'s nothing to panic about at this time. We see outbreaks like this flare up from time to time.\"" You can further be assured that while, yes, canine influenza is highly contagious, it\'s rarely fatal. It\'s estimated to have a mortality rate of less than 10 percent, and only in young puppies, geriatric dogs, or those with suppressed immune systems. Nevertheless, it\'s a real disease and owners should be informed about it. Current outbreaks are largely restricted to a handful of geographic regions in the United States. The Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine has even created a canine influenza surveillance map to track the presence of the disease. Dog flu symptoms The symptoms of canine influenza include coughing, fever, runny nose, lethargy, and lack of appetite, although individual symptoms may vary from dog to dog. It\'s spread through excretions and aerosolized particles from the respiratory tract, meaning coughs and sneezes will spread it, as will \""nose-to-nose\"" contact between dogs. Canine flu hasn\'t been found to be seasonal the way that human influenza is, though the weather can play a role in spreading it. \""This seems to be more of a problem in the spring, when dogs are going to dog parks and people are traveling so dogs are going to kennel situations. Because it\'s so very contagious,\"" Pamela Greenwald, DVM, a Michigan veterinarian and state representative for the Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association, told Healthline. Greenwald noted that people traveling with their dogs throughout the summer can also spread dog flu to areas it otherwise wouldn\'t spread. \""I think with most outbreaks, they do tend to start in urban and suburban environments because there\'s a lot more contact,\"" she said. Prevention is the best medicine. Photo: Getty ImagesAn evolving virus In 2015, Chicago became the site of the worst outbreak of canine influenza seen since its discovery a decade earlier. More than 1,000 cases of the disease were reported at that time. The outbreak also marked a new development for canine influenza. A new strain appeared. Whereas the initial greyhound cases in 2004 were linked to H3N8, the strain that caused the Chicago outbreak was determined to be H3N2, an avian influenza A variety that had already been reported circulating among dog populations in South Korea. Again, a strain of influenza, this time in birds, had made the jump to dogs. One year later in 2016, H3N2 was discovered to have made another species jump and infected cats in an animal shelter in Indiana. The spread of canine influenza to and from different species has raised the prospect of a potentially serious epidemic - should it become capable of infecting humans. But, to be clear: There\'s never been a case of a human becoming infected with canine influenza and there is no evidence that it can spread to humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider canine influenza a \""low threat to humans.\"" However, that doesn\'t mean that the idea isn\'t worrisome. \""It\'s so contagious that the concern about it is that just like the swine flu and avian flu, the influenza virus can very quickly mutate. At this point they haven\'t seen any evidence of mutation, but how contagious can this be and how quickly can it spread?\"" said Greenwald. According to current estimates from The Humane Society, there are roughly 90 million pet dogs living in the United States today, or about 1.5 dogs per household. The notion of man\'s best friend, an animal held near and dear to so many people\'s hearts, carrying a highly contagious disease is understandably troubling. Worse, some researchers have pointed to dogs as a potential \""mixing vessel\"" for influenza. The flu isn\'t easily spread between all species - human to bird and vice versa, for example. But, some species, the so-called \""mixing vessels,\"" can play host to a wide variety of forms of influenza. This can result in influenza viruses swapping genetic information and creating novel forms of the virus with pandemic potential. The deadly H1N1 \""swine flu\"" influenza strain that caused a global pandemic 2009 resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people - a combination of avian, swine, and human flu virus - is believed to have resulted from the \""mixing vessel\"" phenomenon. For now, however, the idea of canine influenza spreading to humans is merely speculation. Dog flu vaccination and treatment Treatment options for dog flu are robust. There is in fact a canine influenza vaccine for either strain. There\'s also a bivalent option available, meaning that it protects against both strains. The flu vaccine for dogs is generally regarded as safe and effective, but it\'s still quite new, and experts say it isn\'t for every dog. The vaccine is regarded as a \""lifestyle vaccine,\"" meaning that whether your dog needs it or not will depend on a few factors. \""If dogs aren\'t leaving their home, they aren\'t exposed to other dogs, I don\'t know if it is necessarily required. But if they are going to go to the city or the groomer or if it\'s required, I think it\'s a good idea until we know what\'s going on with this virus,\"" said Greenwald. Some kennels are now requiring that dogs receive the vaccine before being housed there. Even if not required, the vaccine may be a good idea, simply because boarding facilities with many dogs in close proximity can be a place where influenza can spread. And should your dog actually come down with a case of the flu, pay attention to their respiratory symptoms and have them diagnosed by a veterinarian. The disease is highly contagious so make sure to isolate the animal from other dogs and pets. Caring for a dog with the flu is similar to caring for a human who\'s been infected: Plenty of liquids and rest are in order. In some cases, antibiotics are also used if there\'s concern about possible bacterial infection. In a majority of cases, dogs with the flu usually recover completely in two to three weeks. \""Dogs with basic supportive care recover from it just like a lot of people might recover from the common cold or a mild version of the flu that people might come down with during the winter time,\"" said de Jong.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEzKe4VGdUd87xpU2I_u3IqZn3_VA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=vQuaW4CUI4v96QS3ko-YCA&url=https://www.healthline.com/health-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-dog-flu,EN,,13/09/2018 07:03,2018-09-12 03:13:27+00:00,411af49341,Healthline,,,,,1536729207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8a7101a2e8,The GDP is a Poor Measure of Progress - OB Rag - OB Rag,"The GDP is a Poor Measure of Progress<br />By John Lawrence<br />Gross Domestic Product does not measure the well-being of human beings.<br />War, natural disasters, incarcerations all add to positive GDP growth. Profits from casinos, drug sales, cigarette sales, junk food all add to economic growth.<br />Stock buybacks contribute to GDP. GDP is based on distorted values. If I pay down my debt, that does not add to GDP. If I borrow more money and go into debt and go out and buy stuff, that increases GDP.<br />Wall Street insistence on short-term profits, as opposed to long-term growth, does add to GDP. GDP is f\'d up, yet for every politician and government functionary it\'s the sine qua non of economic indicators. Every swindler that parts someone with a buck contributes to GDP growth.<br />Every saver that saves a buck contributes to lowered GDP and perhaps a recession. 70% of GDP is consumer purchases. Lowered consumption means lowered strain on the environment, but also lowered GDP.<br />The more the fossil fuel industry fracks and extracts and sells gas to gas guzzling cars, the more GDP goes up and the more the destruction of the planet is hastened from global warming. Converting to renewables won\'t contribute to GDP after initial costs are paid because the sun\'s energy is essentially free.<br />At that point, the Koch brothers will be out of business as will Exxon Mobil and all the rest of the associated industries. But the conversion is absolutely necessary and essential if planet Earth is to remain habitable by humans. The insects will always hang on even after the last human exits the planet, so that\'s something. Lowering the contribution to GDP from the fossil fuel industry will of necessity change the economic system.<br />If I grow my own vegetables, fix my own car and live frugally, this does not add to GDP. George W Bush told us after 9/11 to go out and shop. This was his prescription for fixing the economy. Just go out and buy, buy, buy. Buy a whole lot of junk you don\'t need. Then rent a storage locker to store the stuff that\'s overflowing your garage. That adds to GDP.<br />All this worthless garbage that \""grows the economy\"" could be better done without. The money saved would be better spent helping the most impoverished in the US and around the world, helping the climate change refugees in Bangladesh and Indonesia, helping the people suffering from natural disasters in West Virginia and the Philippines.<br />Riane Eisler[1] says GDP does not measure human well-being, does not measure environmental sustainability, does not measure even long-term economic success. A hedge fund that destroys a company\'s union adds to GDP because profits go up, but that\'s not long term economic success especially for the workers involved.<br />The US with its vaunted GDP has the highest infant mortality rates, the highest maternal mortality rates and the highest child poverty rates in the developed world. Our economic values, the economic values of capitalism are completely distorted. We need a measure not of economic growth, but of economic well-being. That would comprise the values of a society in which no one lived below the poverty line and which economic inequality was reduced. How many billions does a billionaire really need in order to have every luxury known to the human race? But they don\'t stop there. They use their access to control the political system guaranteeing that their class will prevail ad infinitum.<br />Do we want to have a society comprised of an elite class of super wealthy combined with a class of minimum wage working peasants? Whatever happened to the promised utopia where robots would do all the work and the humans would have a life of leisure combined with ample material goods?<br />Instead, we have a dystopia where wealthy elites own all the robots and the rest of us, the 99%, make minimum wage as retail workers, teachers, baristas and Uber drivers. It\'s precisely a dystopia because wealth isn\'t widely shared. If it were, all people would have to work perhaps a 15 hour work week doing the work robots can\'t do while our ownership of widely dispersed wealth would guarantee us an income sufficient to buy whatever it is we can buy now working a 60 hour week or requiring two or three incomes to purchase a home and a car.<br />Imagine everyone being wealthy enough to receive a monthly dividend check for $5000. for doing nothing like the wealthy elite does. Except their monthly dividend check is more like $1 million.<br />I\'m tired of hearing politicians like Bernie Sanders, whom I dearly love, say things like, \""In the wealthiest country in the world, why are children going hungry?\"" FYI, Bernie, we do not live in the wealthiest country in the world. There are some private individuals and families that are extremely wealthy; that does not a wealthy country make. In fact, the US government (meaning we the taxpayers) is extremely impoverished. We borrow billions of dollars each month, month after month, just to pay for our war machine.<br />We have trillions of dollars in needed infrastructure repairs. Roads and bridges are crumbling. It\'s a scenario that fits right in with disaster capitalism that will play out after the next big disaster brought about by a bridge collapse.<br />Republican politicians will say that government is incompetent because it can\'t do the needed repairs and the roads and bridges should be privatized so private corporations which are much more efficient can do them. Then they erect toll booths and extract rent. Formerly free services now become profit centers for some, income drains for others.<br />We can\'t even provide safe drinking water for our citizens. We are not a wealthy country. We have a wealthy elite and that wealthy elite are not even really citizens of the US as they take their financial dealings offshore to tax-free jurisdictions. Actually there are more Chinese billionaires than US billionaires[2]. So, Bernie, please don\'t keep saying that we are a wealthy country.<br />Einstein said, \""You cannot solve problems with the same thinking that created them.\"" We need to think outside the box.<br />Noam Chomsky said that the political movement that Bernie Sanders has created needs to continue regardless of the election cycle. It should be seen as something that will not go away as soon as the election is over.<br />Bernie\'s campaign, in my opinion, is not important in the sense of whether or not he will win or lose, but because of the fact that he is getting revolutionary and much-needed ideas and possibilities out there and into the minds and consciousnesses of the American people. And he\'s dealing with tangible items that affect the middle class and the young like student loan debt.<br />Riane says that we need an economic system that gives real value to caring for people and caring for our Mother Earth. That\'s what will create real wealth. Right now financial legerdemain, trompe l\'oeil, adds to GDP. All sorts of hedge fund activity like buying companies, loading them up with debt and then paying the principals handsomely, the kind of thing Mitt Romney did with Bain Capital, adds to GDP. Building a company from the ground up with the goal of long-term financial and economic soundness doesn\'t. Wall Street demands short term profits not long term growth.<br />Worker-owned enterprises spread the financial rewards more widely while working for the man in minimum wage jobs just contributes to the menialization of American workers. Self-employment and co-operatives hold the promise of long-term wealth accumulation while student loan debt holds out the promise of nothing more than lifelong penury and indebtedness.<br />Americans are delusional if they think that a BS degree and $50,000 of debt is going to enable them a to have a better life than would a free apprenticeship in some practical skill which has a market demand in the local economy and no debt.<br />Gross National Happiness[3] is a much richer objective than GDP or economic growth. In GNH, material well-being is important but it is also important to enjoy sufficient well-being in things like community, culture, governance, knowledge and wisdom, health, spirituality and psychological welfare, a balanced use of time and harmony with the environment.<br />GDP does not value the caring economy: the mothers\' work in the household economy, the pre-school teachers who love and nurture the children in their care, the work of volunteers who drive seniors to do their grocery shopping and provide companionship, the nurses and CNAs who care for patients while making a pittance in salary.<br />At the same time GDP overvalues those who sit in corporate boardrooms, the cronies who give the CEO stock grants and options and then vote to buy back stock so the CEO and other executives as well has hedge fund activists can make a killing, the \""angel\"" investors who give millions to questionable start-ups, the IPOs that create instant billionaires thus driving the economic divide.<br />Meanwhile, those with 401(k)s are being led to slaughter like lambs and will be the primary sufferers in the next financial meltdown. Seniors will be hung out to dry if Republicans like Paul Ryan get their way and convert social security to vouchers. They will wind up with a Wall Street controlled social security program similar to a 401k and subject to the vagaries of the market.<br />In a caring society the status of women will be more an indicator of the general quality of life and long-term economic success than GDP. So why don\'t politicians and other economists take these indicators into account? They don\'t really care about the values pertinent to women and children. They devalue their interests in favor of short term profits of corporations. Caregiving values are associated with women who have been historically disenfranchised in favor of masculine values, the values of money making.<br />Caring for Mother Earth, caring for children and caring for those who are vulnerable and helpless, caring for the homeless have no economic value in terms of the masculine values of capitalist economic systems. And I say capitalist systems in the plural because so-called communist systems like China have in fact capitalist economic systems.<br />A Chinese insurance corporation just recently bought the historic Hotel del Coronado in San Diego. They also own the Waldorf Astoria in New York as well as many other luxury properties in the US.<br />GDP doesn\'t matter. Lowered GDP doesn\'t matter. What matters is not goods produced in China and elsewhere overseas and then shipped to the US in big containers ships. These represent outsourced American jobs.<br />What matters is developing the local economy in terms of co-operative enterprises comprising worker-owners. This distributes wealth and makes us less dependent on huge international corporations. If a recession follows, so be it. GDP is mainly an indicator of the health of large financialized corporations.<br />What is needed is the health of the local economy, the wealth of the caring economy, the economic indicators which value lifting mothers and children out of poverty, the economy that puts a floor under the income level of individuals and families. If this shoots GDP all to hell, so be it.<br />We don\'t need Wall Street banks to run the economy. Local bartering systems can substitute for monetary exchange needs until a public banking[4] system is developed. Perhaps even Bitcoin can bypass the US dollar as the measure of all things.<br />Supporting the local, caring economy the economy that insists that everyone is well housed, well fed and well educated and has their basic needs met in terms of health care is more important than GDP growth.<br />References^ Riane Eisler (www.youtube.com)^ more Chinese billionaires than US billionaires (www.cnbc.com)^ Gross National Happiness (en.wikipedia.org)^ public banking (www.publicbankinginstitute.org)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFgb1vU1sSnTLHyj8lvpyZPbkVLeQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779145734208&ei=6Z-dV6DrOsLNzAbeo6iICw&url=http://obrag.org/?p%3D108563,EN,,31/07/2016 07:07,2016-07-01 16:31:00+00:00,8742bf891f,OB Rag,,,,,1467397860,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8a46b998e4,9 Ways the Jezebel Spirit Can Rule a Nation - Charisma News,"9 Ways the Jezebel Spirit Can Rule a Nation - Charisma News<br />How can the Jezebel spirit control a nation? (Flickr)<br />Scripture teaches us that a nation can be overrun by the ruling demonic spirit operating through a powerful political or religious leader.Demonic spirits can also infiltrate a culture through education, arts, entertainment and media. Infiltration can also take place through lobbyists and lower level political foot soldiers working on the staff of elected officials to influence policy. The fact that the enemy works through political and religious leaders is clear in Scripture (Rev. 16:13-15; Acts 13:6-9).In this particular article, I am focusing on the demonic influence of Jezebel. Lest anyone think that I am becoming too mystical regarding my view of Jezebel, we find a reference to this in Revelation 2:20-23, in which Jesus rebukes a church for tolerating Jezebel. I doubt these passages are referring to a literal woman named Jezebel, but they either refer to an unholy congregational culture and/or a person demonically embodying Jezebel of old. Who was Jezebel? She was the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, who was a Baal worshipper. Ahab, the king of Israel married Jezebel, probably for the sake of a political alliance. Connected with this narrative in 1 Kings 16:31-34 is the practice of child sacrifice, which is akin to our modern-day practice of abortion. (Some Satanists connect abortion with a ritual offering to the devil, in which they view as a satanic human sacrifice.[1])The stakes are always very high regarding who the ruling entity is over a nation. If a nation ever comes totally under the control of Jezebel, its persona will loose hordes of the demonic upon that nation resulting in the proliferation of perversion, rebellion, child killing and intolerance on a scale most people have never experienced before!The purpose of this article is to give the body of Christ more discernment regarding their choice of a religious or political leader and also so they can pray against the looming spirit of Jezebel that is trying to overtake the nations!The following are nine ways the Jezebel spirit rules a nation1. There is a marriage based on gaining political power.As we read in 1 Kings 16:31, King Ahab married the daughter of another king, (Ethbaal) most likely to consolidate political power and influence for himself. It is common for Jezebel to enter into a marriage of convenience that accommodates the lust for power both spouses have. With Jezebel, it is always power and politics first, people second.2. There is a propagation of child sacrifice in the land.Whenever a political leader cannot protect the most innocent among them, like the unborn human, you cannot trust them to protect and value the sanctity of human life. In the case of the United States, even though Planned Parenthood was shown-video[2] recordings demonstrate this to be true beyond a reasonable doubt-to abort the unborn for the sake of selling and harvesting their body parts, you still have political leaders like Hillary Clinton championing the organization\'s cause. She is the only presidential candidate ever to receive the endorsement of Pl[3]anned Parenthood.3. Jezebel operates through fear and intimidation.King Ahab would tell Jezebel what bothered him, and then she would act on his behalf (and do what her husband was to afraid to do himself). We see this in 1 Kings 19:1-3, when Ahab reported to Jezebel that Elijah killed all the prophets of Baal, and in 1 Kings 21, where he told Jezebel that he was depressed because Naboth would not sell him his vineyard. In both instances, Jezebel took action, threatening the life of Elijah or executing Naboth and unlawfully giving Ahab Naboth\'s vineyard. Evidently, Jezebel struck fear into all those around her, including her husband, Ahab, and the prophet Elijah who ran for his life from her (1 Kings 19:3). Those operating under a Jezebel spirit like to rant, rave and attempt to control others by striking fear into them.4. Jezebel has no tolerance for the prophetic word of God.The spirit of Jezebel has no tolerance for contrary opinions and wants to rule with an iron fist. She especially hates it when a person speaks the truth from the throne of God (1 Kings 19:1-3) Not long ago, the far left liberals once pushed for tolerance, but now that they enjoy more power and influence, they are trying to legislate intolerance for those who oppose their views[4].There seems to be a Jezebel spirit operating through many of these political and cultural leaders who demand obedience and punish those who oppose their ideology.<br />advertisement<br />5. Jezebel allows the spirit of seduction to prevail.It is interesting that in two different instances in Scripture, sexual immorality and Jezebel are connected (2 Kings 9:22, Rev. 2:20-23). While there is no direct example in Scripture of the Old Testament figure Jezebel participating in sexual immorality, she definitely creates and or enables a culture of unbridled promiscuity in her midst. Read 2 Kings 9:30 to see her attempt to influence people in power through seduction.When this spirit is in a nation, church or politics, there will definitely be an acceptable environment of perversity in their midst. Political leaders operating with this spirit will have a history of promiscuity and scandal connected to them and their inner circle.6. Jezebel is a liar.As we see so clearly in the narrative found in 1 Kings 21, (when Jezebel compelled two elders in Jezreel to bear false witness about Naboth so he can be put to death), Jezebel will continually lie and or stretch the truth to fit her narrative so she can have her way. With some religious or political leaders, it seems as though lies, manipulation and scandal follow them everywhere they go! This is a symptom of the spirit of Jezebel operating through them to control others. With certain political leaders in the national spotlight, there are always a scandal and accusations of lying[5] and twisting the truth. If it continually happens, then it is possible they are functioning with a Jezebel spirit.7. Jezebel usurps the law. Jezebel is a law unto herself. She will follow it as long as it suits her and will disregard it when it doesn\'t serve her ends. Again, the narrative of 1 Kings 21 illustrates this truth. Political and influential leaders operating in this principle will usually have continual legal accusations following them regarding their breach of the law[6] and or following proper protocol.8. Jezebel is demonically inspired.A passage in 1 Kings 9:22 states that Jezebel was involved with sorcery, which is a form of power, gained from the assistance or the control of evil spirits. No doubt the Old Testament character Jezebel was overtly involved in practicing witchcraft; however, any influential person attempting to control, manipulate or compel people by fear and intimidation can be demonically inspired even if they are not overtly practicing black magic.9. Jezebel will eventually bring judgment.Woe to the nation, people or community that is lead by or under the control of a person with a Jezebel spirit. They will be like sheep following a false shepherd into a pit. They will call good evil and call evil good, put darkness for light and light for darkness (Is. 5:20)Many nations of the world have already fallen under this influence, and it will only get worse if they allow the wrong person or persons to lead them. Like Israel of old, and like the church of Thyatira (Rev. 2:18), this demonic influence eventually leads to divine judgment.May God spare our nation and our churches from being dominated and ruled by the spirit of Jezebel.

2e778eb20f,Man guilty of wasting sheep parts - Cody Enterprise,"Man guilty of wasting sheep parts | Local News<br />For many, September\'s crisp air and shortening days herald the arrival of hunting season, and the pack trips, meditative glassing sessions and jerky dividends that come with it.Not for Tyler Sluyter. Not this year, or next.On Friday, a Park County jury found Sluyter guilty of wasting edible portions of a bighorn sheep he harvested in September 2015 in the Thorofare Plateau region of the Washakie Wilderness.<br />For the low misdemeanor, presiding Circuit Judge Bruce Waters ordered Sluyter to pay $1,040 - the maximum fine - and assigned him six months unsupervised probation and a 90-day suspended jail term. Most upsetting for the defendant, however, was Waters\' last stipulation - that Sluyter not be allowed to hunt, trap or fish anywhere in or outside of the state until Sept. 8, 2019.\""Mr. Sluyter\'s hunting privileges are tremendously valuable to him, they\'re a part of his culture and heritage,\"" the defendant\'s attorney Neal Stelting said at sentencing, asking for a one-year ban.Sluyter has 30 days to decide whether to appeal the decision.In 2015, Sluyter won a coveted sheep tag in the Wyoming Game and Fish Department lottery for hunting licenses. He harvested his sheep in the proper area and in-season, but a jury of six found Sluyter to be derelict in leaving much of the animal\'s meat to rot in the mountains. Sluyter had caped the sheep, removing the head and shoulder hide so they could be turned into a trophy mount upon Sluyter\'s return to his home in Daniel, Wyo., near Pinedale, but the jury found he was not diligent in attending to the rest of his kill.Sluyter and several other members of his hunting party testified that he had shot the sheep between four and six times, rendering much of the animal\'s carcass bloodshot to the point of being inedible.Prosecutor Branden Vilos and Eugene Brumbaugh, the hunter from Wapiti who initially called WGFD about the sheep\'s carcass, disputed the number of bullet wounds in the sheep.Sluyter\'s two-day trial brought to Park County around a dozen witnesses from as near as Wapiti and as far as Cheyenne.Appearing on behalf of the defense were several members of the Roberts family, also of Daniel, who were with Sluyter on his fateful hunt.On the other side of the court room were a bevy of special witnesses called by the State of Wyoming: among them Brumbaugh, three game wardens for the agency and three workers for the WGFD Wildlife Forensics and Fish Health Laboratories in Laramie.The case fell into WGFD hands in mid-September 2015, when Brumbaugh called the agency about what he described as a mal-attended carcass in the Thorofare.A seasoned hunter with over 100 big game hunts under his belt, Brumbaugh testified he knew something was wrong as soon  as he laid eyes on the carcass.Though the head and backstrap of the animal were missing, the sheep\'s hind-quarters and tenderloins were untouched, Brumbaugh said. \""They took the easy [meat] and left the rest,\"" the one-time guide testified. He estimated between 80 and 90 percent of the edible meat, or around 30 pounds of the animal, had gone to waste. Furthermore, Brumbaugh said, \""This [ram] would have been one of the easiest ones I\'ve ever seen to pack out.\""When he made the discovery, Brumbaugh said he was on his own sheep hunt with a long-time friend. The two of them talked about what to do that night in camp.\""This isn\'t right,\"" Brumbaugh remembered telling his buddy. He decided to gather evidence and turn it into WGFD upon his return from the field. \""[The hunter] will end up paying a fine and learning a lesson,\"" Brumbaugh said he thought at the time. \""It ended up here.\""Brumbaugh took 23 pictures of the carcass, which the State turned into a grisly slide show during Brumbaugh\'s two and half hour testimony. He also recovered one .300 caliber shell casing, a cigarette butt and DNA samples from the sheep, which he stored in sandwich baggies.Stelting cross-examined Brumbaugh at length about his ad hoc investigation.The Thorofare region where the sheep was killed is rife with grizzly bears ready to descend on dead animals, and it\'s the farthest place from a road in the lower 48 states, so Brumbaugh\'s testimony, amateur photography and evidence collection formed the bedrock of the case against Sluyter.Brumbaugh said he only saw one bullet wound in the animal, while Stelting suggested there could have been other wounds he missed. \""All the photos of the sheep you took featured the sheep in the exact same position,\"" Stelting said, questioning whether Brumbaugh was thorough.\""Do you personally eat blood-shot meat? Do you know any hunter who does?\"" Stelting pressed.\""If there\'s no damage on the outside, then there can\'t be damage on the inside,\"" Brumbaugh countered, saying he found only the single shot after a long look. \""You need to cut it up to see what you got,\"" Brumbaugh continued, and he said the hunter had made no attempt to do so.\""At the time [Brumbaugh] came to me, he indicated he was pretty upset about the violation,\"" WGFD Chief of Fisheries Allan Osterland testified. He was a warden at the time of the crime.Osterland took Brumbaugh\'s photos and DNA evidence and forwarded them to the WGFD forensic laboratory in Laramie.He also questioned Sluyter about the sheep kill, and elicited what Vilos said was a partial confession from the hunter. Sluyter recanted that interview at trial, saying he had been nervous and didn\'t know he was being recorded. Audio of that interview was played for the jury, however.Osterland also tracked down Sluyter\'s trophy mount, locating it in Fales\' Taxidermy in Pinedale.Osterland asked to take the mount from the shop for comparison to Brumbaugh\'s DNA samples, and the shop owner handed it over voluntarily.Earlier in the case, Stelting argued that Osterland\'s seizure of the head was a violation of Sluyter\'s Fourth Amendment protection against illegal seizures. That appeal was denied by former District Judge Steven Cranfill, however, who said the seizure was legal because the head was in public view.An evidentiary road blockStelting was successful in suppressing other potentially damaging information, however.When a trio of WGFD forensic lab employees took the stand to testify about the DNA samples Brumbaugh had taken, Stelting objected the State had failed to properly maintain a \""chain of custody\"" for the samples.The argument went to chambers and lasted over 20 minutes.When Vilos and Stelting re-emerged, the prosecutor was visibly flustered and asked for a brief recess to retool his approach.Waters had ruled the DNA evidence inadmissable because somewhere between entering Osterland\'s care and getting to the WGFD lab the State had not maintained proper control. It\'s unclear what link in the chain was compromised.<br />With the samples thrown out, the analysts from Laramie could only testify that they had written reports. Their findings could not be discussed, and WGFD forensic specialist Kim Frazier left the stand with a grimace on her face, seemingly having made a long trip north for little reason.Testimony from Sluyter and the members of his hunting party concluded the trial.Three people in the party testified they had heard \""five or six\"" shots from Sluyter\'s gun, but none said they had seen him make the kill.\""I\'ve never seen anybody damage meat that badly in my life,\"" Ryan Roberts testified.\""We were joshing [Sluyter] a little bit about shooting so much,\"" Louie Roberts added. \""We got to the back end of the animal and it was all blood-shot,\"" Louie continued: \""It was all mush.\""The defendant also took the stand. \""I think I was seeing hair and pulling the trigger,\"" Sluyter said, calling it a case of \""ram-fever.\""The left ham \""was bone fragments and lead fragments all the way through,\"" he said. A meat processor getting such meat \""would have said, \'Why did you drag that thing here?\' And he would throw it in the garbage,\"" Sluyter said.\""We don\'t teach [young hunters] to use six bullets to kill an animal,\"" Stelting said in his closing argument. \""Things happen in the woods. You may not like it, but it\'s not illegal.\""Sluyter harvested \""only the portions that were easy to remove while taking the cape,\"" Vilos countered. \""He wanted a three-quarter curl to put on the wall, and we know that because of what was left behind,\"" the prosecutor said. \""This is intentional and needless waste.\""After 45 minutes of discussion, the jury sided with Vilos.Noting a prior moose-poaching incident and a bear-baiting violation, Vilos said Sluyter was a repeat offender who needed a stern lesson. At sentencing he asked for $2,000 in restitution, in addition to the $1,040 fine, and a three-year hunting ban.Stelting asked for the return of his client\'s trophy and a one-year ban.Waters split the difference, assigning a two-year ban. \""If you have other licenses that\'s too bad,\"" he said. \""He had legal permission to take that sheep, so I don\'t think [restitution is appropriate],\"" Waters said. In any case, bighorn sheep are valued at $15,000 by WGFD in poaching cases, he said.The return of the head was an issue for another day, the judge continued, though he said he was inclined to think of the trophy the same way he thought of stolen goods.Waters said his sympathy for the defendant was limited by a number of factors.\""In the back of my mind, I wonder if all those extra shots were for the purpose of damaging the meat,\"" Waters said.\""Wyoming is a Compact State, so keep in mind if you apply for a license in another state there\'s a good chance Wyoming will find out about that violation,\"" Waters warned before court was dismissed Friday evening.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEq9kjtOhUdgwYxbAoFzziFrxlZoA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=Q4a3WYD0A8WCzQb7n424CA&url=http://www.codyenterprise.com/news/local/article_aee9dcc8-9732-11e7-b5c5-671850cb67dc.html,EN,,12/09/2017 07:00,2017-09-11 19:03:33+00:00,2149121cdb,Cody Enterprise,,,,,1505163813,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8a576d63d0,"Hand, foot and mouth disease on the increase in St Vincent - News ... - Jamaica Observer","Hand, foot and mouth disease on the increase in St Vincent - News<br />Hand, foot and mouth disease on the increase in St Vincent<br />Tuesday, November 08, 2016 | 9:27 AM     <br />KINGSTOWN, St Vincent (CMC) - Health authorities Tuesday said there has been an increase, recently, in the number of cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in St Vincent and the Grenadines, but did not disclose any figures.<br />Communication Officer in the Ministry of Health, Neeka Anderson-Isaacs, said that in light of the development, the ministry is advising residents, particularly school administrators and parents, to be cautious in how they deal with the cases to minimise a further outbreak.<br />The World Health Organization (WHO) says HFMD is a common infectious disease of infants and children. It is characterised by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks.<br />WHO, however, noted that HFMD is not to be confused with foot-and-mouth (also called hoof-and-mouth) disease which is caused by a different virus and affects cattle, sheep, and pigs. <br />Anderson-Isaacs said the symptoms of HFMD usually include fever, sore throat, reduced appetite, painful sores in the mouth, with blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.<br />Blisters may also appear on the knees, elbows, buttocks or genital area.<br />The disease commonly occurs in children under five years of age, but a milder form of the disease may also develop in older children and adults<br />\""Children can become infected through personal contact, such as hugging, kissing, sharing cups and utensils, with other infected children or adults. The virus that causes HFMD can also be spread through coughing and sneezing, contact with nose and throat secretions (such as saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus), blister fluid, and faeces (for example when changing a diaper),\"" Anderson-Isaacs said.<br />She said the ministry further advises that HFMD is highly contagious and urges parents to care for children at home and away from other children for a period of 7-10 days, or until the infection resolves.<br />The Senior Nursing Officer/Community Nursing Service, Cecile James-Samuel, notes that the best method of prevention is regular hand washing with soap and water for children and their caregivers.<br />Disinfecting surfaces, including toys and doorknobs, can help to minimise and control the spread of the disease.<br />Grenada\'s Ministry of Health on Thursday confirmed reports of an outbreak of HFMD disease at some daycare and preschool centres across the island.<br />Chief Medical Officer, Dr George Mitchell, said the ministry had received reports of 12 cases, and going forward public education and direct intervention will be the main focus.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNElVzJrP9D_93LQgcvPWVMoRcv7UQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779266006275&ei=SNAiWM60OoSMW4bnnoAE&url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Hand--foot-and-mouth-disease-on-the-increase-in-St-Vincent,EN,,09/11/2016 08:01,2016-11-08 13:29:21+00:00,2149121cdb,Jamaica Observer,,,,,1478615361,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8a0a90c175,"Across party lines, they crossed the Legislature\'s color line - Minneapolis Star Tribune","Across party lines, they crossed the Legislature\'s color line<br />One was a Republican lawyer and skilled orator, originally from Maryland. The other: a Kansas veterinarian and ardent Democrat.<br />John Francis Wheaton arrived in Minnesota in 1893 - nearly 70 years before Bert Robert Lewis. Their deaths, 57 years apart, came early and surprised those who knew them. Wheaton killed himself at 55, inhaling lethal gas in New York City. Lewis suffered a fatal heart attack at 47 in his Golden Valley home.<br />Between their moves to Minnesota and those sudden deaths, the two men carved their names into state political history. Wheaton, a descendant of slaves, was the first black man elected to the Minnesota House in 1898. Lewis became the first African-American elected to the state senate 74 years later.<br />Even before joining the Legislature, Frank Wheaton, as he was commonly known, had earned respect as the first black graduate from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1894.<br />\""Confronted with all the obstacles of race prejudice, John Francis Wheaton has climbed a rugged path such as few men have successfully surmounted and won for himself a record and a name that would be envied by any man,\"" the Minneapolis Journal proclaimed in an 1897 collection of profiles called \""Progressive Men of Minnesota.\""<br />Born in Hagerstown, Md., in 1866, Wheaton shined shoes and milked cows to earn money while attending college in West Virginia to become a teacher. At only 22, he served as an alternative delegate at the 1888 Republican National Convention in Chicago.<br />A popular stump speaker, he landed a clerkship in Congress while studying law at Howard University. When Republicans came to Minneapolis for their national convention in 1892, renominating President Benjamin Harrison, Wheaton must have liked what he saw.<br />\""Tiring of his continual struggle against the disadvantages imposed upon men of his color,\"" the Minneapolis Journal said, he moved to Minnesota in 1893 and attended law school at the U while working as a hotel waiter and railroad porter.<br />He and his wife, Ella, had two sons and Wheaton was soon earning $5 a day as a clerk at the Capitol. He kept confronting racism, though, being denied service in one restaurant in 1895 and then getting falsely accused of stealing a white man\'s wallet at St. Paul\'s Metropolitan Hotel in 1897.<br />He sued and ran for the Minnesota House from the Kenwood area of Minneapolis. Despite fewer than 50 black adults among the district\'s 9,000 voters, he won.<br />He introduced 15 bills during his one term, including an expansion of the kinds of businesses forbidden from discriminating based on race. In 1890, he wowed fellow attendees at the state Republican convention.<br />The Minneapolis Times said he was able to \""hypnotize the convention with oratory.\"" And before \""delegates had time to pull up the lower jaws,\"" another newspaper said of his oratorial prowess, he successfully nominated himself for a symbolic delegate spot at the national convention.<br />Just as Wheaton was ascending in Minnesota politics, he left - moving to Chicago to help found an insurance firm. He said he loved Minneapolis \""better than any place on earth\"" and hoped to return someday.<br />\""I got my start here,\"" he said before he left. \""I owe a great deal to the people of the city, where everyone is accorded \'equal rights\' without regard to race.\""<br />Instead of returning, Wheaton headed to New York City and became a leading figure in the Harlem scene. In 1921, one of his legal clients skipped bail, leaving Wheaton on the hook for the $10,000 bond. Distraught over the debt and impending financial ruin, he killed himself Jan. 15, 1922.<br />Lewis, his Minnesota Senate barrier-breaking counterpart, was born about a decade later in Hutchinson, Kansas. A Korean War veteran, he studied animal husbandry and veterinary medicine at Kansas State.<br />In 1962, Lewis moved to St. Louis Park. An attendant at the Texaco station remembered his white \'62 Chevy pulling in.<br />\""It being St. Louis Park, he may have been the first black man I had ever talked to,\"" Paul Linnee said on the town\'s historical society website (slphistory.org). \""He was new in town, needed gas and wondered if there was a pet hospital in town.\""<br />Linnee pointed him to Fitch\'s Pet Hospital, which Lewis purchased. He\'d driven up earlier and been refused a chance to buy or rent another property.<br />When he moved into his St. Louis Park neighborhood, unloading a U-Haul with a friend, neighbors misread the situation.<br />\""My friend and I arrived and began unloading the furniture, and the neighbors, I assume, thought we were just workmen unloading the furniture,\"" he said in a 1967 interview. \""They had no idea that a Negro was moving in next door.\""<br />He said a neighbor circulated a petition protesting his arrival, but only one person signed it. He promptly landed a spot on the St. Louis Park school board in 1966 and then won a seat in the state senate in 1972 when only about 26 black residents lived in the suburb.<br />He sponsored legislation to help victims of family violence and expanded catastrophic health insurance. Twice married with two children, Lewis\' stature in the Senate climbed in the 1970s - along with the stress.<br />During the 1979 session, he served as finance chairman of a health and welfare subcommittee - becoming an abortion-rights advocate in the process.<br />When he died April 25 in the final month of the session, his widow blamed the fatigue of round-the-clock hearings for the heart attack. Margaret Sandberg later filed a workers\' compensation claim, saying the pressures of his job killed him. She testified that he loved his early days in the Senate but grew disillusioned as his responsibilities grew, lobbying intensified and more conservatives were elected.<br />Since 1980, the Minnesota Public Health Association has given out the B.

8a0d3c3ebd,To leave it better - Tri-State Livestock News,"To leave it better | TSLN.com<br />Healthy soil. Abundant wildlife. Improved water sources. Intentional business planning. Quality of life.<br />These are all aspects of what the Doan family, owners of Black Leg Ranch of McKenzie, North Dakota, include in their definition of sustainability. As winners of the prestigious 2016 National Environmental Stewardship Award, presented at the 2017 Cattle Industry Convention and NCBA Trade Show in Nashville, Tennessee, earlier this month, the Doans have proven that sustainability is not just a goal, but a way of life. Today Jerry and Renae Doan\'s four children and their families are all back on the ranch, representing the fifth and sixth generations on the land.<br />The Black Leg Ranch comprises 17,000 acres in central North Dakota. About 14,000 acres is grazing land, where they rotate 600 head of owned cattle and custom graze 2,400 head. Close attention is paid to soil health, which generates greater forage production, limits erosion and reduces costs. The Doan family also partners with farmers on 3,000 acres of cropland, which allows the family to guide crop rotations, no-till practices and cover crops, while providing residue for cattle forage.<br />In addition, the Doans have implemented an intensive grazing program after installing more than 65 miles of high-tensile fence to create 90 pastures, allowing them to move cattle to new grass every one to seven days.<br />\""We put an emphasis on soil health to help boost the land\'s productivity and generate income,\"" said Jerry Doan. \""We use an intensive grazing management system that basically mimics with intensive grazing what the buffalo did with natural roaming.\""<br />The Doans have also made significant water improvements with new wells and a pipeline. \""It helps move cattle into areas where they wouldn\'t necessarily graze before; it eliminates cowtrails, and helps improve wildlife.\""<br />The Black Leg Ranch started in 1882 - before North Dakota was even a state - when Jerry Doan\'s great-grandfather, George Doan, claimed a homestead. Doan\'s grandfather, Jewell Doan Sr., built the ranch up in the dirty thirties, buying land for $1 and acre when people thought it wasn\'t worthless. \""He was an incredible businessman - liked by everyone,\"" said Doan. \""He did everything with his airplane - flew where he needed to go, worked cattle. He had the wildest cattle around because of it!\""<br />Jewell Doan Sr. introduced Angus cattle to the ranch in 1930 - some of the first in the nation - to a predominantly Hereford landscape. \""People hated those black cattle, and he was just enough of a character he named it the Black Leg Ranch,\"" said Doan.<br />After graduating from North Dakota State University with a degree in animal science, Jerry Doan returned to the ranch as the fourth generation. \""Times were tough in the \'80s, and I decided to attend an Allan Savory holistic management school to learn how to better manage our natural resources,\"" he said. \""Our goal is to turn the ranch over in better shape than what we go it in - in terms of natural resources, wildlife, soil health, and business. We want to leave it better.\""<br />Today the family has proven they are capable and committed to making it better. Doan said their main bread and butter is the cow herd and cattle business. \""But as we added other members of family, we had to find new niches.<br />\""I kind of said to each one of the kids when they wanted to come back, \'What are you going to bring to the operation? What niche can we find, what area can you specialize in?\'\"" said Doan. This need for diversification has evolved into a fully-functional working guest ranch, agritourism and hunting operation, and corporate event host that enable them to share their story of stewardship with people outside of agriculture.<br />Son Jeremy and his wife Ashlee are parents to Jaxton and Avriana. After he graduated from NDSU, Jeremy returned home and established Rolling Plains Adventures - a hunting and guiding operation. They offer five guest facilities, including the main lodge that was the original Sears and Roebuck ranch house where Jerry\'s father was born and died. \""We talked about tearing it down and rebuilding, but realized people want to hear and see the history, it\'s all part of the story,\"" said Doan. The remodeled ranch headquarters includes a commercial kitchen, liquor license and hosts corporate events along with mule and whitetail deer, pheasant and waterfowl hunters.<br />Son Jay graduated business school in Arizona and worked for Anheuser-Busch out of state before deciding he missed North Dakota. He proposed starting an agritourism business as his niche. Today he and wife Kari, parents to Jamisyn and Jayston, help manage the corporate events and western weddings, which are booked out a year in advance. In 2012 they were awarded the North Dakota Governor\'s Award for best tourism package in the state.<br />Daughter Shanda Morgan is married to Don, who works in banking, and they are the parents of Jayden, Kyler, Shayda and Kayzen. Shanda rodeoed at the University of Wyoming and lived in Texas before returning home to help develop the tourism and hunting operation. She also assists with the wedding venue business and corporate guest events. <br />Youngest son Jayce just returned to the ranch after rodeoing and graduating college at Montana State. \""He\'s more into the cattle side, doing some grass finishing on beef, looking at ways we can develop that business,\"" said Doan.<br />Doan said his wife Renae is \""the glue who holds it all together.\"" Along with working as an assistant to the Senate Majority Leader in the North Dakota legislature, Renae works behind the scenes in all aspects of the ranch operations. \""Most of this wouldn\'t have happened if it wasn\'t for her,\"" said Doan. \""She\'s never one to be out in the limelight, but she\'s always working behind the scenes to make sure everyone is taken care of. She\'s a big part of the success of the whole thing.\""<br />Working together as a family is a joy that comes with challenges. Doan said they strive every day to improve communication, and most importantly - to understand where each member of the family is at in their visions. \""My goals and dreams are much different than my kids\' because I\'m at different stage of life. It isn\'t always easy, but I\'ve really tried to stay open minded and because of that, have been able to support their ideas.\""<br />Marshall Johnson is vice president of the National Audubon Society and has collaborated with the Doans on several bird studies. Although often times conservation groups and ranchers can be at odds with each other, these two clearly have a mutual respect for the work of the other.<br />\""To have someone that\'s innovative like that, adaptive like that, it\'s really inspiring to those of us in the conservation community,\"" said Johnson. \""And I think that type of openness to innovation is why they\'ve been so successful.\""<br />Doan said diversifying has created opportunities to tell their story to people and groups who may not always have the same philosophies. \""When I can get them on the land and show them what we\'re doing, so many go away with a positive image. Ninety percent of the time we are on the same page - the other 10 percent, we just agree not to focus on that. Most of the time we can work together; we just have to bridge that gap.\""<br />With the mark of a true steward, Doan said they will always work to find ways to get better.<br />\""We want our stewardship to continue to improve. We\'ll probably never be finished, but I just want to keep pulling up that hill,\"" he said.<br />\""At end of the day, we\'re leaving a legacy. I feel this ranch is bigger than all of us. Our rich history and tradition is bigger than us.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNG33KfezLjG7Q55e-b8kqvJFXbJgw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=eUatWOCAH467WduJtPgE&url=http://www.tsln.com/news/to-leave-it-better/,EN,,22/02/2017 08:06,2017-02-22 02:46:11+00:00,51fe179e08,tate Livestock News,,,,,1487735171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8a2459c5ce,In the Summertime - Pig World,"In the Summertime | Pig World<br />The recent period of proper summer weather has come as a welcome relief and has also helped to stimulate barbecue demand after a long wet winter and spring.<br />The SPP has moved up by a significant 0.8p to 146.62p and weekly contribution prices were also trending firmer with rises of up to 2p/kg in places.<br />Spot buyers were also looking for (rather than at) pigs, with bids in the 150p region quoted and it\'s good to see that spot prices are now level pegging with contract in many cases.?But with feed costs on the rise, producers will need to watch every penny to maintain their margins.<br />Unfortunately the sow market is not displaying any buoyancy, although it is something of a relief that this week German prices stood on - however,?this is still at a very low level with UK cull sow exporters bidding in the 60-63p range. This time a year ago cull sows were being marketed at 106p/kg which for a 150kg deadweight sow works out at a value drop of ?66/head!<br />Hopefully with better weather across northern Europe, alfresco eating will push up pig meat demand but with the Russian/UK pig meat import embargo in place it is difficult to see if there will be any World Cup boost as far as pig meat demand is concerned. Looking further ahead it is even more difficult to see how there will be any pig meat benefits in 2022 when the World Cup moves to Quatar!<br />The wide gap between Freedom Food and Red Tractor weaners remains in place and, although the latest AHDB 30kg average looks a reasonably healthy ?52.79/head and the 7kg price has also moved up ?1.46 to ?37.38, it is difficult to find many takers with space.<br />Not only are producers having to keep an eye on rising feed costs, but the price of straw has gone through the roof with reports in East Anglia of straw trading on an ex-farm basis between ?90-?120/t and in the north and west at considerably higher levels. This has put a brake on some finishers filling yards because straw is extremely scarce even if you can afford to buy it in the first place.<br />Feed prices are also heading north with 48% soya meal traded ex-Liverpool at ?385/t and UK spot ex-farm feed wheat is still on the rise with average spot sales quoted at ?151.80/t. There is a saying that \'wheat follows oil\' and this is underlined by reports that there has been more upward pressure on wheat prices in global markets, with London wheat quoted for July at ?148.20/t and November at ?152.50/t at a time when crude oil prices are rising following the US/Iran embargo.<br />With feed costs forming 60% of the cost of rearing pigs, further increases in this sector will start to cast a shadow over the profitability of UK pig prices unless ours keep pace too.<br />And finally more concern over African swine fever was highlighted in the media this week underlining the threats posed by the Forest of Dean wild boar population and reports of African swine fever spreading at an alarming rate across Europe starting from Russia and now posing a major threat in parts of Eastern and Central Europe.<br />Closer to home, the main worry is that feral pigs in the UK will be accessing barbecue sites and getting into waste bins increasing the risk of potential ASF contamination.<br />Perhaps we need to check on the sources of all the pig meat being fed to visitors at the Pig and Poultry Fair next week and \'Buy British\'?<br />Get Our E-Newsletter - Pig World\'s best stories in your in-box twice a week",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEiwDjtsIhMIbsrGP4QiIBRJ5kFGw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=1DT5WoOUI4ybzQatvaCwAw&url=http://www.pig-world.co.uk/comment/in-the-summertime.html,EN,,14/05/2018 07:03,2018-05-14 04:12:01+00:00,3c4acf1de1,Pig World,,,,,1526278321,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8a2a719f4b,Exclusive: Horrific Animal Deaths at Minnesota\'s Bio Corporation Exposed in Undercover Video - Newsweek,"Horrific Animal Deaths at Minnesota\'s Bio Corporation Exposed in Undercover Video<br />In a warehouse in Alexandria, Minnesota, pigeons are drowned alive and crayfish are injected with latex while still conscious. Workers there say they freeze turtles to death. The dead animals will be shipped to public school science classrooms for dissection.  The warehouse belongs to Bio Corporation, one of many companies that preserve and sell dead animals for anatomical study. Undercover footage obtained by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) taken at Bio Corporation in October revealed disturbing practices that local police are now investigating, by order of the court.Wanting to investigate how animal specimens are prepared, PETA, a nonprofit animal rights organization, set its sights on Bio Corporation when a job opened up there. An animal rights activist took the position-and then took the video. Mostly the footage captures employees preserving animals that are already dead, but it also shows live animals meeting deaths that were neither quick nor painless. (Excerpts of the footage accompany this story.) Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now[1] Pigeons are among the animals that may be subject to cruel killing practices at a Minnesota company. Robert Claypool on Flickr PETA is known for its strong, even overwrought, reactions against nearly any use of animals. But in this case, a local judge agreed with the organization\'s concerns. In late October, after reviewing an affidavit from the activist and the video, the judge ordered the local police to investigate Bio Corporation for potentially illegal practices involving animal cruelty.By mid-November, the Alexandria police department had still not made contact with Bio Corporation. Frustrated by the slow pace, PETA filed complaints with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), which is responsible for certifying pre-dissection facilities like Bio Corporation, along with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA).The USDA mandates that their dealers kill animals by euthanasia-that is, painlessly-in keeping with guidelines set by the American Veterinary Medicine Association[2] (AVMA). According to the AVMA, which notes that there are different laws in different states[3], euthanasia of animals in Minnesota must be done by a veterinarian or under the direct supervision of one. And the federal Animal Welfare Act prohibits unnecessary pain and suffering of animals[4]. Crayfish are also among the animals potentially subject to cruel deaths at an animal supply company in Minnesota. David W. Cerny/Reuters David Rosengard, a staff attorney with the Animal Legal Defense Fund Criminal Justice Program, say that in Minnesota, all animals are protected. \""We start from the proposition that every animal is covered, and this includes pigeons, turtles and crayfish,\"" says Rosengard. Any animal killings in the state must be conducted out of necessity and in the most humane way possible. Violators of this rule could be subject to a misdemeanor.  The deaths seen in the video footage taken at Bio Corporation appear to violate what Rosengard describes as euthanasia requirements. \""If you have to kill a pigeon, surely there\'s a way to do that that causes less pain and less trauma and less suffering for that bird,\"" he says. And regardless of whether drowning is a humane form of euthanasia-a matter of some debate[5]-such deaths take several panic-induced minutes and the AVMA does not permit it. \""Putting a live, conscious bird into a vat of water is not a good death, is not euthanasia,\"" says Dan Paden, PETA\'s associate director of evidence analysis. The same likely holds true for latex injections and freezing animals alive.When asked about how Bio Corporation kills animals, owner Bill Wadd, who was unaware of the ordered investigation when Newsweek contacted the company, insisted that the company adheres to the law. \""We\'re fully within the USDA jurisdiction on the Animal Welfare Act, we have a very strong compliance record with the USDA,\"" says Wadd. \""We follow the Animal Welfare Act fastidiously.\""But Wadd said employees at Bio Corporation \""generally don\'t euthanize animals.\"" When pressed about occasions when Bio Corporation does euthanize, Wadd said, \""we don\'t, generally.\"" The undercover video clearly shows employees killing animals, raising questions about what guidelines the company is adhering to. Newsweek sent PETA\'s footage to Bio Corporation for comment, but has not received a response. A supporter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) lies on the pavement next to the Centre Pompidou modern art museum, to raise awareness on World Vegan Day, in Paris, France, November 1, 2017. Christian Hartmann/Reuters Typically biological supply companies buy animals that are already dead. Slaughterhouses sell fetal pigs from pregnant sows and skinned minks from fur farms, for example. School districts across the U.S. buy fetal pigs, frogs, rabbits, and other animals for classroom dissection and education. Bio Corporation, for example, sells[6] preserved frogs for $0.90 each, sharks for $5.50 each, and dog skulls for $30 each.Whether the killing methods observed at Bio Corporation are unique to this company or widespread is impossible to say because these practices aren\'t usually disclosed to the public. By email, Keith Barker of Carolina Biological Supply, which also sells animals for anatomy studies, said that \""many of the specimens Carolina offers for dissection are products of the food industry.\"" Some are leftovers, says Barker, and others would have gone to the food supply. When asked about how the company euthanizes live animals, Barker wrote that \""some processes ... are confidential.\""PETA\'s current investigation is not its first. Carolina Biological Supply came under scrutiny in the 1990\'s when its undercover operatives found that cats were killed at the company, and even filled with preservative chemicals while still alive. ABC News investigated and found that several of the animals had not come pre-euthanized from shelters[7]. Animals rights activists protest against the use of animals for experimentation in Barcelona, 2013. Albert Gea/Reuters Animal dissection has long been considered a valuable component of science education, but may be on its way out. Proponents argue that the experience helps students understand anatomy[8], but multiple studies suggest that the virtual alternatives to animal dissection are at least as effective at educating students[9]. Many animal welfare advocates have also spoken out against dissection, calling it antiquated and unnecessary. But the practice persists. Animallearn.org[10] estimates that students in U.S. high school classrooms dissect 6 million animals per year. According to Richard Wyffels, Chief of Police, the Alexandria force has in fact begun an investigation of Bio Corporation. In addition to potentially violating AVMA guidelines and the Animal Welfare Act, Alexandria law enforcement also suspects that the treatment of animals at Bio Corporation could violate Minnesota state animal mistreatment laws. But a search of the premises requires both a specialized veterinarian and a warrant, both of which have been slow to arrange-thus the delay since the judge\'s late October mandate. Wyffels expects that his team will conduct a physical investigation of the Bio Corporation warehouse this week.If the video is anything to go by, the mood among the workforce may not help Bio Corporation\'s case. The activist reported that killing animals by these methods appeared to be \""business as usual at that company,\"" says Paden. Employees were casual about their work, even making jokes about it. \""There was no indication that killing animals in that way was out of the ordinary.\""References^ Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now (subscription.newsweek.com)^ set by the American Veterinary Medicine Association (www.aphis.usda.gov)^ laws in different states (www.avma.org)^ Animal Welfare Act prohibits unnecessary pain and suffering of animals (www.aphis.usda.gov)^ a matter of some debate (wildlifecontrolconsultant.com)^ sells (biologyproducts.com)^ ABC News investigated and found that several of the animals had not come pre-euthanized from shelters (www.youtube.com)^ helps students understand anatomy (www.storefrontscience.com)^ at least as effective at educating students (onlinelibrary.wiley.com)^ Animallearn.org (www.animalearn.org)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHTimZcpsKJxoXUisgla01_hd1i6Q&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779684917713&ei=2i4VWpj9J4-CzQb1oJ7wCg&url=http://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-undercover-video-exposes-horrific-animal-deaths-company-supplying-717647,EN,,22/11/2017 08:00,2017-11-21 10:00:08+00:00,7b34ef8790,Newsweek,,,,,1511262008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

44e14f60a0,Home Theater - Boston Review,"Home Theater | Boston Review<br />Practicing Golf Swing (1986) / Courtesy of Larry Sultan Estate<br />A couple of years ago, the man who introduced me to Jesus was sentenced to six months in federal prison. This hardly came as a surprise. When you grow up in the suburbs, you come to expect that a shadowy Lynchian underworld lurks below the sunny façade, that every resident of your town possesses an inner Jekyll, a Janus twin. The faithful husband collects porn in his closet. The prom queen is hiding the scars on her arm. But the fact that these clichés were immortalized in such movies as Blue Velvet (1986) and American Beauty (1999) did little to lessen their power over me as a kid. If anything, it seemed to confirm my suspicion that something malevolent was afoot, that a corpse would be found in a neighbor\'s backyard, that a sibling might enlist in Heaven\'s Gate.<br />John Cheever and John Updike drilled this terrain to its hardpan, against which the likes of Rick Moody and Jon Franzen still clink their shovels. Emphasizing the devastating effects of conformity and ennui, these authors borrowed heavily from the Frankfurt School, which argued that a physical cul-de-sac would breed an existential one. And yet these denunciations offer little education to someone who actually grew up there, amid the cologne of freshly mown lawns and the shick, shick of mechanized sprinklers.<br />After living in cities for more than a decade now, it is strange for me to report that I miss the suburbs. I miss the carnivorous whiff of a Weber grill and the sibilance of a push-broom against the pavement. I miss the drone of distant lawnmowers and the special urgency of back-to-school commerce. Of course, this kind of nostalgia wears an obvious scarlet letter. Underwritten by redlining and other prejudicial zoning laws, the suburbs have always been a vexed utopia, a haven for people who could afford to flee the deprivations of the city. If you ventured there as a kid-for a field trip or a sports tournament, say-anxious parents would admonish you in somber tones to carry your wallet in your front pocket, to always travel in packs. Such \""life lessons\"" seemed to suggest that the city was a Stygian nightmare, a wasteland of rampant muggings and nomadic perverts. For these reasons suburban extraction usually carries a heavy burden of guilt and can perhaps explain why a lot of my friends point reflexively to the nearest urban center whenever someone asks where they\'re from. \""Milwaukee,\"" they say. \""Detroit.\"" It is an attempt to elude the shame of their beginnings.<br />One never really senses this stew of political remorse and personal wistfulness in The Corrections (2001) or American Beauty. But it was precisely this ravel of sentiment that overcame me when I attended the Larry Sultan retrospective[1] last December at the Milwaukee Art Museum. From the late 1970s to his death in 2009, the California-based art photographer had been reckoning with his upbringing in the San Fernando Valley, where he was sired by a stay-at-home mom and an executive for the Schick Razor Corporation. In the 1940s, his parents joined the exodus of Jewish immigrants who left Brooklyn for California, enchanted by the myth of the West as a land of endless opportunity, a Shangri-La of rambling lawns and two-car garages, swimming pools and evening highballs.<br />Sultan was interested in the metonymies of the American dream: cosmetics and cigarette ads, groomed lawns and fast-food combo plates.<br />If great art begins with an act of mutiny, Sultan\'s took the form of adolescent revolt. Growing up in the shadow of Hollywood, he lived in a suburban development where residents chased tinsel-town approximations of the good life. He responded with slouch and defiance, leaving his parents\' bungalow, first for a political science degree at UCSB, and then absconding to the Bay Area to attend the San Francisco Art Institute. But the art world he encountered there was bohemian and quaint, still clinging to the gusty passions of the Beat generation. Sultan, by contrast, was interested in the metonymies of the American dream: cosmetics and cigarette ads, groomed lawns and fast-food combo plates. He eventually found artistic kinship with a fellow grad student named Mike Mandel, another kid from the burbs, and together they sought to pull back the curtain on pleasantville and interrogate the diktats of consumer culture.<br />In the early 1970s, Sultan and Mandel constructed a sequence of commercial billboards, which had been donated to them by a couple of local marketing firms looking to rehabilitate their public image during a moment of widespread anti-billboard sentiment. By giving ad space to two local artists, the marketing firms hoped to quell the hue and cry of Californians who thought the roadside monstrosities were marring the West Coast\'s picturesque landscape. But the installments Sultan and Mandel created were a parade of caustic satire. On one in Boulder, Colorado, they painted a nuclear mushroom cloud bracketed with the incongruous phrase, \""Ooh la la!\"" A few years later, Bay Area residents glimpsed a sign that read Whose News? Abuses You, an unambiguous indictment of corporate media. The project reached a fever pitch of overstatement in 1985 with another San Francisco billboard, this one emblazoned with images of bedraggled smokers accompanied by a caption that read We Make You Us.<br />We Make You Us (1985) / Courtesy of Larry Sultan Estate and Mike Mandel<br />While these sorts of public interventions were unique at the time-a prelude to the earthwork sculptures of Robert Smithson and the sardonic street murals of Banksy-it\'s hard not to see in these excoriations of consumer culture a spirit of boyish contempt. However visually striking, the billboards feel jejune and didactic, the work of youngsters newly enlightened to the fact that the cozy suburbs of their childhood were predicated upon a lie. But if Sultan\'s interests ended here, with these morose fulminations, his work would have no use for me, a thirty-year-old man trying to understand his conflicted feelings toward his suburban homeland.<br />_ _ _<br />One night in 1982, Sultan was visiting his parents, and instead of renting a film, as was their custom, the three of them decided to unearth a box of old home movies that had been cobwebbed with years of disregard. Sultan was astounded by the tapes. What flickered across the darkened living room weren\'t merely random clips of backyard barbeques, kids\' birthday parties, or trips to Disneyland. Instead, they watched what Sultan would later describe as \""thirty years of folktales-epic celebrations of the family.\"" Not his family per se, but the institution itself. \""They were remarkable, more like a record of hopes and fantasies than of actual events,\"" he writes. \""It was as if my parents had projected their dreams into emulsion. I was in my mid-thirties and longing for the intimacy, security, and comfort that I associated with home. But whose home? Which version of the family[2]?\""<br />Pictures from Home, a project undertaken from 1982 to 1992, walks a tightrope of sociological inquiry and memoiristic saga, mingling film stills from the home movies with more recent photos of his parents in their Palm Springs retirement community. Aesthetically, Sultan had taken a cue from the Canadian art photographer Jeff Wall, who made radiant large-scale pictures modeled after the Modernist painters in an attempt to liberate the photographic medium from its status as a trace and elevate it instead to the echelon of representation. Politically, the photos were a punch to the jawline of the Moral Majority, a cohort of evangelical leaders and conservative think tanks who\'d begun to use the family as an ideological tool in electoral contests. \""The family they were talking about,\"" Sultan said, \""was quite oppressive and I felt that the family was one of the most complicated, unnerving institutions, and yet it is the last institution anyone, I think, believes in.\""[3] But despite his ambitions to denigrate neoliberal policy, Sultan ended up producing a more personal-ultimately more profound-body of work.<br />Sultan choreographed these scenes, but they typify his parents\' quotidian events. One photo depicts the exterior of the family bungalow at some non-hour of mid-afternoon, with an eyeblue sky looming in the background and a doily of tree-shade spread across the lawn. In the foreground, sprinklers emit languid helixes of water, lending the house the atmosphere of some glinting Arcadia. Another photo shows his seventy-something mother reclining in a deckchair. Her makeup is dense and Baby-Jane garish, and with her head canted toward the sky, the scene attains a prayerful quality. In Business Page, we see the Sultan patriarch sitting in a chair with a newspaper tented over his face, a subtle allusion to Cezanne\'s withering portrait of his own father.<br />Mom in Curtain (1991) / Courtesy of Larry Sultan Estate<br />If all photos are about death, as Roland Barthes contends in Camera Lucida (1980), then Pictures from Home functions as a peculiar act of eulogy. Not only do they memorialize the theatricality of the American family, they also lament his parents\' dutiful commitment to their chosen roles-mother as doting housewife, father as starchy breadwinner. It is one thing to bemoan the influence of consumer culture with the frosty gaze of an anthropologist. It\'s quite another to locate the symptoms of this influence in your parents, to recognize that the life they\'ve built for themselves bears the tokens of various American myths. After all, the mother who adopts the June Cleaver façade is still your mother. The father with his briefcase and his wordbank of corporate clichés is still your dad. Therein lies the profound sadness of suburbia. In photographing his parents, Sultan attempts to flutter the veil of these social roles, to reveal the human person beneath the hard rind of stereotype.<br />To a viewer of suburban pedigree, Sultan\'s genius lies in his ability to isolate certain domestic tableaux so that they faithfully evoke scenes from your own childhood. Somehow Sultan is able to shrink the distance between studium and punctum, defying Barthes\' famous contention (also in Camera Lucida) that a photograph of his own mother-the Winter Garden Photo-can have no true poignancy for us, we who were strangers to this woman. Sultan flouts this subjectivity. There is community in conformity, he seems to suggest, kinship in the cookie-cutter state of mind.<br />At some point while shuffling through the exhibit, my wife found me standing in front of a wall-sized portrait of Sultan\'s mother where I was frozen reverentially as though in the presence of a holy monument. Mom in Curtain depicts a woman trying to unravel herself from a drape, presumably after adjusting a lever on the window. The curtain is diaphanous and seasick green, and the mother, who wears a white flowing robe, is visible through the shroud, evoking a monarch trapped in its chrysalis. Like her suburban environment, what once was a layer of protection has become a net of captivity. How many times have I glimpsed my own mother ensnared in this gauzy tangle? How many times have I overheard her cursing as she tried to extricate herself from the brocade?<br />A similar pang of recognition occurred when I approached a staggering wall-sized photo of Sultan\'s father entitled Practicing Golf Swing. There is a touching grace in the father\'s posture as he winds up his club. His twiggy legs are bent together like those of a fawn balancing on an icy pond, and his head is angled in a regal attitude, as if ready to be minted on a coin. The carpet is plush and intensely green, recalling the densely napped turf of a mini-golf course. Sultan has curated the scene to juxtapose the natural world-glimpsed through yet another limpid curtain-with the artificial interior of the home. Several critics have read the photo as a dismissal of communal life and a retreat toward cloistered spaces, a visual corroboration of Robert Putnam\'s Bowling Alone.<br />At what point is masquerade mistaken for reality? At what point does our unfeigned expression bear the mold of the mask we wear?<br />But this interpretation fails to acknowledge the extent to which the father is preparing for a social event, a game most often associated with casual business meetings. Unfettered from the stiff operations of the boardroom, the real deals and handshake arrangements take place on money-hued fairways, during the back nine. I know this only because my father was an avid and adept golfer, and since the game carried a business component, he often prepared for his tee-times with a kind of monastic devotion. In the penumbral light of the garage, he scraped away clods of mud from the bottoms of his cleats and used a special chamois cloth to polish his clubs to a high sheen, positioning them in a bulky Titleist bag with the meticulous care of a florist arranging a bouquet. And in the open pasture of our living room, he was often known to practice the choreography of his golf swing, sometimes for an hour at a time. Actually, he did this everywhere-in department stores, in line at the grocery store, in the backstage before my wedding.        <br />The Greeks bifurcated their lives into two realms-the civic (polis) and the domestic (oikos). They believed that a private home, cordoned off from the gaze of others, should be committed to the exigencies of the body-eating and defecating, grooming and reproducing. The home was a place of preparation, a rehearsal space in which people could ready themselves for the amphitheater of public life. But Sultan\'s photos reveal the dramaturgy that endures even behind closed doors. Because the rituals of self-construction are observed by our loved ones, they too become a performance, an everyday matinee of private yearnings. The father sees himself practicing his putt. The son sees his father longing for approval.<br />Sultan\'s parents, it should be acknowledged, were not simpletons. Far from hapless stage props, they were keenly aware of their son\'s artistic project and sometimes even adamantly challenged its rarefied thematic content. His father took particular issue with a photograph called Thanksgiving, which shows Sultan\'s mother standing at a kitchen window and presenting an uncooked turkey. The scene is meant as an objective correlative to Thanksgivings gone by, and its raw pink exterior, embalmed with gobs of butter, serves to vivify his mother\'s mortality. Afternoon shadows occlude her face, making her seem apparitional, a ghost. Sultan\'s father protested the subtext of this photo, accusing his son of indulging in \""stereotypes of how people age[4].\"" Sultan replied that in nearly every picture his father had taken of his mother, she \""is posed like a model selling one thing or another.\"" This matrix of competing perceptions-between wife and mother, model and cook, domestic role and living woman-was precisely the intricate portrait of the suburbs that Sultan wanted to create. At what point is masquerade mistaken for reality? At what point does our unfeigned expression bear the mold of the mask we wear?<br />_ _ _<br />For the remainder of his career, the suburbs would be something of an idée fixe for Sultan. In 1998 Maxim magazine commissioned him to return to the San Fernando Valley of his youth to shoot what critic Rebecca Morse described as \""a day in the life of a porn star.\"" In the decades since he grew up there, the Valley had been invaded by the adult-film industry, which saw the sleepy bedroom community as the perfect backdrop for a spectrum of porn tropes: delivery guys and smutty nannies, forlorn housewives and chiseled handymen. When Sultan arrived on set, he found himself less than a mile from his old high school. Residents of the Valley, he learned, would rent out their homes to porn studios for a few days at a time so long as the warm domestic interiors were left undisturbed while the actors screwed gymnastically. Sultan captured this odd enjambment. Smiling family photos hang on a far wall, observing a bout of fellatio. Between takes, a nude man hunches at the sink of an immaculate kitchen, his body washed in the Vermeer light of an open window.<br />Topanga Skyline Drive #1 (1999) / Courtesy of Larry Sultan Estate<br />Sultan was interested less in the sex acts themselves than in how these accoutrements of middle-class success collided with the motifs of desire. \""While the film crew and talent are hard at work in the living room,\"" he wrote, \""I wander through the house peering into the lives of people who live there. I feel like a forensic photographer searching out evidence.\"" Evidence of what, he doesn\'t say. Philip Gefter, a colleague and close friend, proves to be a more eloquent spokesman of Sultan\'s preoccupations: \""The Valley is a serious meditation on an existential impulse (sex), in the context of late capitalism (money), animated by the artifices/edifices of the American dream (happiness).\""[5][6]<br />This troika of countervailing forces-desire, money, happiness-breeds a psychic flavor that feels unique to suburbia, one that over the course of his prolific career Sultan managed to document so convincingly. An unsettling nostalgia lurks in these images. Sultan seems to pine for a notion of home that no longer exists. Maybe, the photos seem to suggest, it never did.<br />But how can a person occupy a nowhere place, a mirage, a dream city? Again and again, Sultan returns to these enclaves of middle-class banality, revisiting the coordinates of his past, hunting for something authentic among the twinkling subdivisions and manicured parks, the strip malls and Saturday soccer games. As a native son, he straddles the border between contempt and compassion, decrying the odious social policies that have created such affluence while at the same time understanding the enticements of this idyll. How to capture this puncturing discord?<br />Sultan loiters at the edges of the suburb, observing its operations but unable to ever truly return.<br />In the summer of 2006, Sultan began driving around the fringes of the Valley where hordes[7] of immigrants congregated near lumberyards in search of work. Implicating himself in the thorny economy of migrant labor, Sultan hired several men to pose in \""the terrain of scruffy nature that lies between one suburban development and another[8].\"" Near a colony of townhomes, the men walk through a corridor of brunette shrubbery and withered prairie, carrying tinfoiled platters for a potluck dinner. Another photo shows two Latino men piloting a skiff through a lane of placid water. By presenting these men in interstitial zones, Sultan forces the viewer to confront two conflicting visions of American life-the hedonism of the suburbanite against the desperation of the immigrant. In these scenes we are reminded that the labor of immigrants has created the very suburbs from which they are so often excluded. On most days, they scrub toilets and pick avocadoes, clean pools and groom hedges, but here they are engaged in the pastimes of the leisured class, which conjures \""the poignancy of displacement.\"" [9]The series was called Homeland.<br />\""Homeland,\"" of course, is a loaded term, one that carries connotations of both national security and political exile. Protect the homeland! cries the xenophobe along the Texas border. It\'s impossible to return, mourns the shaken refugee. The life I had there is gone. Curiously, the one usage is an inversion of the other. For the citizen, \""homeland\"" is a way of life that must be preserved and protected. For the exile, it is a way of life one can never get back.<br />Canal District, San Rafael (2006) / Courtesy of Larry Sultan Estate<br />In a sense, the displaced workers of Homeland can be seen to approximate Sultan\'s own relationship to the suburbs, loitering at its edges and observing its operations, but unable to ever truly return. Forever he remains an interloper, an émigré in his native land. It\'s a sentiment that calls to mind the \""softer emigration\"" that James Wood discusses in his quiet, tenebrous essay \""On Not Going Home.\"" Chronicling his own decades-long expatriation from England to the United States, Wood describes the voluntary condition of living apart from one\'s birthplace as \""secular homelessness\"":<br />Most of us have to leave home, at least once; there is the need to leave, the difficulty of returning, and then, in later life as one\'s parents begin to falter, the need to return again. Secular homelessness, not the singular extremity of the exile or the chosenness of biblical diaspora, might be the inevitable ordinary state.<br />By the end of his life, Sultan seemed to have understood this liminal condition with a kind of throbbing acuity, and it goes some way toward explaining my own ambivalence toward my suburban upbringing. Toward the end of the piece, Wood hazards a modest theory: \""Perhaps to be in between two places, to be at home in neither, is the inevitable fallen state, almost as natural as being at home in one place.\""<br />_ _ _<br />By the time we left the exhibit a prickly silence had overtaken the museum, a sense of things coming to an end. Near the exits blue-blazered docents yawned and made a show of checking their watches. It was a lazy hour on the day after Christmas, and as we braced ourselves for the December cold, we could see in the distance the snowy tundra of Lake Michigan, its edge frozen into a serrated cliff. Colored lights were strung up in the downtown shrubbery, lending our trip the festive quality of a dream.<br />We were heading to my mom\'s house in the suburbs. Along the expressway, the long scroll of Milwaukee\'s industrial history unspooled before us-a maze of stockyards and clapboard houses, a sector of factories veined with railroad tracks. Now, the city is known for beer and Teutonic kitsch, a reputation aided by the aroma of yeast hanging over the highway near the Miller Brewing plant.<br />We exited the freeway and whipped past a cascade of glowing signage: Barnes & Noble and Target, Subway and Famous Footwear. Vast swaths of prairie land had been cleared to make room for this blinking commerce, but it\'s impossible for me to avoid becoming flushed with nostalgia whenever I drive this stretch of concrete, sensing among these titans of suburban retail the ghost of the kid who once lived here.<br />When we pulled up to Mom\'s house, I could see through the mammoth picture window my brother and his kids roughhousing next to the tinseled Christmas tree. Mom greeted us at the door with swift puckered kisses, and my niece and nephew performed a vaudeville of cartwheels and sock-slides in an attempt to impress us. Before we could put down our bags, my niece was tugging on my pantcuff, begging me to make a snowman. The walls of the living room were smothered with family photos-scenes of baby baths, college graduations, and autumn weddings-and I was experiencing the eerie double consciousness that results from an encounter with artistic mastery. I was seeing this house as Sultan would see it, toggling between nostalgia and despair, a hologram of disquieting emotion.<br />Outside, clots of snow fell from the darkening sky, and my niece was lurid against the twilight. She wore a neon pink parka and matching snow pants, boots that resembled marshmallows. Together we built a frosty homunculus. It was three feet tall, with rocks for eyes and a woodchip mouth. It wore a rumpled trilby that Mom had dredged from the basement for expressly this purpose, and two arthritic-looking tree branches served as arms.<br />Standing in the snow-confected lawn of my mother\'s suburban house, I felt myself pantomiming a family tradition, a crude approximation of a seasonal ritual. It was the same sense of forgery that I felt last October when my wife and I took our nieces and nephews to a local cider mill. The \""farm\"" featured a corn maze, mangy goats that subsisted on dispenser pellets, and a hay-decorated farmhouse that sold fresh donuts and spiced lattes. It was an ersatz version of the real thing, a soundstage, an evocation of a pastoral American history that no longer exists. It was as real as the actual harvest as the whiff of pumpkin that emanates from a Yankee Candle.<br />In the yard my niece was trying to catch flurries on her tongue. Night had fallen, and as we lingered there in the spectral dark, I remembered a few stray lines from \""The Snow Man,\"" the Wallace Stevens poem. One must have a mind of winter . . . and have been cold a long time . . . not to think of any misery in the sound of the wind. I looked across the yard, and in the warm saffron light of the kitchen window, Mom appeared, wraith-like through the glass, more like a memory of my mother than her actual person. She was standing at the sink and rinsing dishes, her head bowed in somber attitude.<br />In that moment I was lost somewhere between the nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. It was the closest I could get to home, and it seemed achingly far.<br />References^ retrospective (mam.org)^ family (news.google.com)^ \""The family they were talking about,\"" Sultan said, \""was quite oppressive and I felt that the family was one of the most complicated, unnerving institutions, and yet it is the last institution anyone, I think, believes in.\"" (news.google.com)^ age (news.google.com)^ \""While the film crew and talent are hard at work in the living room,\"" he wrote, \""I wander through the house peering into the lives of people who live there.

The entire genome will be made available via the open-access database system Ensembl Genomes, with an expected December 2018 release.<br />The freely available resource allows scientists to share knowledge about the genetics of insects and other arthropods that spread diseases, Pirbright added.<br />\""For the midge community, this is an exciting moment, and our work will assist those around the world who carry out research on these tiny flies,\"" added Dr. Simon Carpenter, leader of the entomology group at Pirbright.<br />The research, published in BMC Genomics, will improve knowledge about which genes are involved in the transmission of livestock viruses and also will allow comparisons to be drawn with other groups of vectors, including mosquitoes and sandflies.<br />\""This is important because division between biting midges and mosquitoes is likely to have occurred more than 200 million years ago, meaning that they differ substantially in their genetics,\"" Fife said.<br />The midge genome will also assist genetic manipulation of this group, including the production of transgenic lines, where genetic changes to an organism are passed down through multiple generations. This technique is already routinely applied in a large number of research areas with mosquitoes, including how they find their hosts, why certain individuals get infected by viruses and why others don\'t and in producing sterile insects for control purposes, Pirbright said.<br />\""One of the difficulties that we face as researchers on this vector group is that there are major challenges in working with such small insects. Providing basic resources like this for what are a neglected species is, therefore, a major accomplishment,\"" Carpenter said.<br />This research was funded by the U.K.\'s Biotechnology & Biological Sciences Research Council.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEBMZdZqgO-BaL7qYQACuDD9J4mFQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=q65_W8DAKc-2zAbHl6WQBQ&url=https://www.feedstuffs.com/nutrition-health/sequencing-biting-midge-genome-paves-way-control,EN,,24/08/2018 07:04,2018-08-23 15:54:05+00:00,63c561e635,Feedstuffs,,,,,1535046845,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
451039a388,Syria conflict: Government accused of chlorine attack - BBC News,"Syria conflict: Government accused of chlorine attack<br />Image copyright<br />AFP<br />Image caption<br />Chlorine is a common chemical, but its use in weapons is banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention<br />Syrian activists have accused government forces of using chlorine in an attack in the north-western province of Idlib late on Monday.Two groups reported that three children were among six people killed when aircraft dropped barrel bombs filled with the toxic chemical on Sarmin.Dozens of other residents of the town suffered from breathing difficulties following the attack, they said.The Syrian military has denied the claim, describing it as propaganda.In January, international investigators concluded that chlorine gas was used in air raids on three villages that were blamed on the government.Separately on Tuesday, Syria\'s state media said government air defences had shot down a \""hostile US surveillance aircraft in northern Latakia\"". It gave no further details, but other reports suggested a drone.Limp bodiesAn opposition official in the Sarmin area told the Associated Press that chlorine-filled barrel bombs were dropped on two locations by government helicopters on Monday night. The first targeted rebel fighters and injured 20 people, while the second hit a residential area, he said.<br />Image copyright<br />Reuters<br />Image caption<br />A local activist said barrel bombs were dropped on two locations in Sarmin<br />A witness at a local medical clinic told the Reuters news agency: \""At around 20:45 we heard the noise of helicopters. We didn\'t hear an explosion. Right after that we started receiving cases, we got around 70. \""Symptoms include eye and nose irritation and dyspnoea (impaired breathing). Most probably it\'s chlorine gas.\""The Local Co-ordination Committees, an opposition activist network, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that a family of six - a man, his mother, wife and their three children - died as a result of exposure to chlorine gas.The Syrian Civil Defence, an organisation that includes more than 2,000 volunteer search and rescue workers known as the \""White Helmets\"", said there were more than 100 casualties and posted several videos online.<br />Image copyright<br />AFP<br />Image caption<br />The Syrian military denied the accusations, describing them as propaganda<br />One showed three apparently unconscious children and a woman at a medical centre.\""One of the infants, only a few months old,\"" the cameraman says as he films a baby on a stretcher with liquid around its mouth before two more infants with limp bodies are brought in.The video could not be independently verified, but corresponded to other reports.A Syrian military source told Reuters that the reports were propaganda.\""We confirm that we would not use this type of weapon, and we don\'t need to use it,\"" the source said, echoing comments made by President Bashar al-Assad in a BBC interview last month.<br />But the president of the Western-backed opposition National Coalition, Khaled Khoja, blamed Mr Assad for the Sarmin attack, writing on Twitter[1]: \""The psychopathic dictator continues to kill by chemicals and challenges the international laws.\""Chlorine is a common industrial chemical, but its use as weapons is banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).Syria signed the treaty after the nerve agent sarin was used in an August 2013 attack on several suburbs of Damascus that killed hundreds of people. Western powers said only the government could have carried out the attack, but it blamed the rebels.Earlier this month, the UN Security Council approved a resolution[2] that condemned the use of toxic chemicals such as chlorine in Syria, and threatened military action in case of further violations.In January, investigators from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded \""with a high degree of confidence\""[3] that chlorine gas was used as a weapon in barrel bomb attacks on three villages in Syria last year, killing 13 people.Their report did not apportion blame, but witnesses reported hearing helicopters at the time of the attacks and only government forces are believed to operate such aircraft in the country.<br />References^ writing on Twitter (twitter.com)^ approved a resolution (www.un.org)^ concluded \""with a high degree of confidence\"" (www.theguardian.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNF6qcIUTdCApPUtZ7tCwJDSaafPEA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52778773460664&ei=-vx9V4iXL6mKzAag47KoBg&url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31930181,EN,,07/07/2016 07:07,2015-03-17 18:00:47+00:00,89284ea485,BBC News,,,,,1426618847,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4526b38379,\'Jealousy behind polygamous family poison deaths\' - Chronicle,"\'Jealousy behind polygamous family poison deaths\'<br />Walter Mswazie recently in Masangula, Mwenezi-THE five people who died in Mwenezi\'s Masangula area on Wednesday after eating food suspected to be laced with poison were victims of jealousy in a polygamous marriage, it has emerged. Sylvia, 7, and Beauty Baloyi, 4, Tafadzwa, 7, and Takudzwa Pote, 4, and an aunt to the Baloyi family, Esther Kunguli, 70, of Village 7, Masangula under Chief Chitanga allegedly consumed milk laced with a cotton pesticide.One of the three wives, Makanani Lisimati, 61, disappeared soon after news of the deaths spread and is still at large. It could not be ascertained yesterday if police are seeking her as a suspect.Family members said burial has been scheduled for tomorrow. The Pote siblings\' mother, Marita Zavirima, 35, and her mother, Felina Lisimati, 69, survived after taking an antidote concocted from cow dung, which was prepared by a neighbour, Tauya Zinhaka.It has emerged that a week prior to the tragedy the polygamous Musuteri Dhambarara\'s two senior wives, Makanani Lisimati and Tikomunyi Mapanyi, 32, were accused of lacing milk with cotton pesticide and trying to poison Zavirima, the third wife. She survived after she was alerted of the plot.Makanani Lisimati and Mapanyi are said to be jealous of Zavirima who is apparently getting all the attention from Dhambarara, 59.Peter Tsutsumani Baloyi, 49, the father of the late Baloyi siblings, who is also Zavirima\'s brother, told Chronicle how the reportedly jealous women made an attempt on his sister\'s life.\""On Wednesday last week we received a report that an attempt was made to kill Marita when milk meant for her was laced with poison.\""God saved her after Lisimati\'s daughter-in-law played whistleblower. The milk was later thrown away but surprisingly Dhambarara ignored the incident,\"" said Baloyi.\""My sister remains a trouble causer in this polygamous marriage and she is responsible for all this tragedy. She is the one who dated Dhambarara but she is not even helping her counterparts in the fields neither is she helping in herding cattle yet she expects to get milk every day.\""The first two wives are the ones taking turns to herd and pen cattle while Zavirima spends quality time with Dhambarara doing nothing,\"" he said. A neighbour, Fazo Zinhaka, said there is a deep-rooted hatred among the three wives. Violet Dumela, 46, the late Baloyi siblings\' mother said she was in indescribable pain after losing her children \""in a cruel manner.\""Zavirima is said to have gone to the main homestead in Village 6 with an empty two-litre container for milk. She allegedly left it in Makanani Lisimati\'s bedroom. At around 11AM, Dhambarara milked his cows and shared the milk among his wives.\""Upon her return Zavirima collected the milk and gave the first wife, Makanani to share among the three,\"" said a source. Zavirima later returned to her homestead in Village 7 where she mixed dried vegetables with the milk since she had no cooking oil.\""She served the food to eight people at around 7 PM. One of the children however, refused to eat the relish while Dhambarara who had arrived also refused saying he had eaten at his main homestead.\""\""A few minutes after eating the food, the seven started complaining of stomach pains and they were trembling. \""Within ten minutes Beauty, Slyvia, Takudzwa, Tafadzwa and Kunguli died. Zavirima and Felina Lisimati survived after drinking a cow dung concoction,\"" said a family member.Tauya Zinhaka took the milk and gave it to a dog which also died within a few minutes. The bodies were taken to Chiredzi Hospital mortuary for post-mortem.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGyuqNbdseALxqQD2ECPy8Y0TSraA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=6rdbV4CgH4WWzAaZs4aABw&url=http://www.chronicle.co.zw/jealousy-behind-polygamous-family-poison-deaths/,EN,,11/06/2016 07:11,2016-06-11 01:55:17+00:00,c9593f6e51,Chronicle,,,,,1465617317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42a60ba045,The 1979 Alien Movie is All About Pregnancy and Early Parenthood - ScreenGeek.net (blog),"The 1979 Alien Movie Is All About Pregnancy and Early Parenthood<br />Ready to feel like the oldest person in the world? Alien, the first in the iconic sci-fi horror franchise, was released in 1979. That means that people born a decade after Alien came out are having children and getting mortgages and complaining about interest rates on their retirement accounts. <br />Whippersnappers with their memes and fidget whatsawhosers. I remember when Blockbuster existed, you infants!Being as old and as established as it is in nerd culture, there aren\'t many people who need to be introduced to this classic film. So, instead of talking about its impact on the industry or gushing about how it\'s still one of the best science fiction films of all time (which it absolutely is), let\'s discuss this one, all-important fact: Alien is all about pregnancy, early childhood and how strange and horrifying it is that these things end up in and out of a lot of us.<br />Oh, and since this is essentially a close reading of the film in order to stretch the material to fit our theory, we\'ll go ahead and say this: spoiler alert. Though, really, it\'s been out for over thirty years, so that\'s a lot of time to have seen it, people.<br />Sexual Awakening<br />*insert whitey tighty joke hereIn the opening scene, the crew awakens, much like youth who were once blissfully unaware of the hormones within their bodies waking up to the horrors of acne, sudden nipple hairs, and new, uncontrollable urge to look at bootys everywhere. Groggy and uncertain, they emerge to investigate a mysterious planet: LV-426. Or perhaps LV-426 is a symbol for what all of us, young and old, are looking for...love?<br />Upon arriving to the planet, they make a rocky landing. But, forgive them, because who amongst us have not made an awkward advance when first navigating a new, unfamiliar landscape? But, land they do, moving us, ever forward to the next step on this journey. <br />Impregnation<br />Fun Fact: That\'s sheep intestines and stomach lining you\'re looking at right now. FX is a glamorous world!Some people plan on when they are having children. Others stumble upon it accidently, much like Executive Officer Kane, who finds himself in a fatherly way through less than an ideal situation. <br />(Quick side note here for some interesting trivia: In order to figure out how to get the alien on the ship, narratively, the writers just decided that, and I quote here, \""the alien fucks one of them.\"" They deliberately chose a male character to be the victim of noted face-sexing for three reasons: it\'s a horror cliche that women are an easy first target, they didn\'t feel it was appropriate to make a woman the victim to this symbolic rape, and they thought that their male viewers would be made even more uncomfortable with the trope being thrust on their own gender.) <br />It also helps this theory out that H.R. Geiger\'s alien designs look absolutely like genitalia. Like, completely like penises and vaginas. <br />There\'s like 7 dicks in this picture.Incubation<br />Om nom nom.Actually, Kane has this part really easy. On average, women are pregnant for nine months, and that\'s nine months of vomiting, stress, hunger, anger, and water retention that he just skipped right past. How long was his gestation period, like a day and a half? And he slept through most of it! <br />Pssssh, that\'s nothing.<br />To be fair, he does make up for pity points with this next bit.<br />Birth<br />Yeah, this is pretty much exactly what giving birth is like.<br />The Uncertainty of New Parenthood<br />\""Moooooooom I\'m hungry, moooooooooom I\'m hungry and I want to play iPad. Mooooooooooom!!\""Now, as the newborn scurries around its new home, its new caretakers find themselves in quite a pickle. What does this new thing want with the already established members of its household? What does it eat? Is its blood so acidic that it will eat straight through the thick metal floors of a space ship?<br />These are questions all new parents ask themselves, and this transition is normal. What was once under control, from your schedule to your eating habits to your level of blood curdling screams, all fly out of your hands. Now, you see why Alien is considered a horror movie - nothing is more terrifying than those first few nights you bring that newborn home with you.<br />(One more fun fact! The sinews in the alien\'s mouth were created with condoms. Do with that information what you will.)<br />Now, this film takes a few artistic liberties regarding the proportional strength of the newborn human baby to the newborn 7 foot tall Alien creature. Also, the number of anticipated acts of savage murder by a typical newborn are a higher than normal, but our theory still checks out here.<br />The Ugliness of Postpartum Depression<br />Pictured: An exact replication of what early parenthood looks and feels like.Were you wondering how we would fit Ash into all of this? I bet you were. Well, here\'s what really seals the deal.<br />Ash represents the swelling rage, confusion, and curiosity that comes with motherhood. (Thank you for this one, fellow editor/writer Mark Salcido.) He is, in a phrase, postpartum depression personified. <br />Constantly hovering over every action of the crew, working against their best interests. He is the real terror, much like postpartum depression, a malicious beast that is not even human. But, like postpartum depression, he is ultimately not in control. He can be defeated. With the power in Ripley herself, the support of Parker, and help provided with a handy flamethrower, that android can no longer make them second guess themselves. They know what they\'re doing now. They know how to handle the new member of the Nostromo family.<br />It\'s also rather poetic that he has milk for blood. Just saying.<br />Letting Go of Insecurities and Embracing this New Step in Life<br />\""I have no idea what I\'m doing, but I\'m going to do the shit out of it anyways.\""Once Ripley has entered the shuttle, she\'s a more confident woman, knowing that she has taken control of a difficult situation and come through it. Though her support network has gotten somewhat smaller, what with the dead crewmates and traitor android and all, she made it through this portion of her life relatively unscathed. She\'s learned new skills on how to handle this newborn creature. That\'s pretty special.<br />Of course, this is where the theory falls apart a little, because she shoots the baby metaphor into outer space with a grappling hook.<br />...<br />Maybe Jonesy is the real baby?Whatever, I\'m going to go watch Aliens. ",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGrkE2gdO-7Chzor2ZTWxYktwwcuw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=kz0hWfCnLMriWf2vuKAE&url=http://www.screengeek.net/2017/05/20/alien-movie-pregnancy/,EN,,21/05/2017 07:11,2017-05-21 05:07:17+00:00,f391c0214d,ScreenGeek.net (blog),,,,,1495350437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42bf9640fa,Harsh winter took heavy toll on wildlife across western US - Hot Springs Sentinel,"Hot Springs Sentinel Record - Harsh winter took heavy toll on wildlife across western US<br />CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Wildlife suffered higher than normal losses this winter in severe weather across the western United States, where the toll included the deaths of all known fawns in one Wyoming deer herd and dozens of endangered bighorn sheep in California.Wildlife managers in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Oregon and Washington also reported higher losses of animals in the wake of one of the coldest and snowiest winters in decades. Parts of the Rockies saw snowfall as late as mid-June.\""This year we kind of had all the factors that we don\'t want -- we had deep snow, we had periods of fairly cold weather, subzero, and then we also had some crusting on top of that snow,\"" said Roger Phillips, spokesman for the Idaho Fish and Game Department.Wildlife managers have been assessing the damage using radio collars and surveys of herds following a winter in which many parts of the West recorded record snowfall, including places where deer, pronghorn antelope and elk migrate each fall to escape the harsher mountain winters. Prolonged snow cover on winter grounds made it difficult for wildlife to find food, and spells of bitter cold made matters worse for the weakened animals by hardening the snow.Mule deer in several Rocky Mountain states and elk in eastern Washington were hit hard. Wyoming was expecting above-normal losses among antelope as well, although it didn\'t have an accurate accounting yet.Wyoming last saw comparable wildlife deaths over three decades ago, said Bob Lanka, supervisor of statewide wildlife and habitat management program with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.\""It\'s been a long, long time since we experienced this kind of loss,\"" he said.Meteorologist David Lipson of the National Weather Service in Riverton blamed the rough winter on \""unusually strong rivers of moisture\"" flowing into the West from the Pacific Ocean, where a weak and unusually short-lived La Nina occurred.In California, the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, which is listed as an endangered species, lost an estimated 40 to 60 animals.\""We\'re not including any predation or normal mortality or any other kind of losses; that\'s just from the snow, from getting trapped up in the snow and not having food, some of them starving and then some of them directly impacted by avalanches,\"" said Jason Holley, supervising wildlife biologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.Montana wildlife were spared the deadly conditions seen in neighboring states, according to Ken McDonald, wildlife division administrator with the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department. Nevada saw near average wildlife losses statewide, while a few isolated areas in the northeast part of the state had slightly higher than average mortality, said Tom Donham, a Nevada Department of Wildlife biologist.Wildlife managers are responding by reducing hunting permits in the hard-hit areas.\""There will be less hunting opportunity this coming fall for sure, and the people that do get a license, whether it\'s a general license or a limited quota tag, I don\'t think there\'s going to be any doubt they\'re going to notice less animals on the landscape,\"" Lanka said.Mike Clark, owner of Greys River Outfitters in western Wyoming, said the loss of mule deer and antelope tags will be hard on his business, which includes deer, antelope and elk hunts.\""Luckily, we can still work with some elk,\"" Clark said.However, outfitters have to be careful not to overhunt elk and overload their fall hunting camps with too many hunters to make up for the decline in deer hunting, he said.\""It just takes away from the quality of the hunt if you got too many hunters in camp,\"" Clark said.Biologists say the wildlife herds eventually should recover with the help of reduced hunting and a return to at least normal weather conditions next winter. However, forecasters say it\'s too early to predict how next winter will play out.\""What happens in the future depends a lot on what kind of winter we see next year,\"" Phillips said. \""If we have back-to-back hard winters, it could be tough.\""National on 07/09/2017",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHywbUBnu3CZ83CZHrapFE2kjFqDw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=MiZjWdD6BsTfWomyh4AN&url=http://www.hotsr.com/news/2017/jul/09/harsh-winter-took-heavy-toll-on-wildlif/,EN,,10/07/2017 07:01,2017-07-09 08:26:07+00:00,7903d30a98,Hot Springs Sentinel,,,,,1499595967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42c42d8738,"Why do most movie villains have bad skin?, Entertainment News ... - The Straits Times","Why do most movie villains have bad skin?, Entertainment News & Top Stories<br />WASHINGTON _ Among the few tell-tale signs of a movie villain are a sadistic laugh, a penchant towards explaining evil plans - and a skin disease.<br />Dermatologists are taking notice with a critical eye.<br />As outlined in a recently published study in Jama Dermatology, movie villains are often afflicted with skin conditions such as alopecia (hair loss), facial scars and periorbital hyperpigmentation (a condition leading to dark circles around the eyes).<br />Some advocacy groups have long attacked Hollywood for these portrayals. When The Da Vinci Code was released in 2006, for example, its villain was a monk-assassin with albinism named Silas.<br />Mr Michael McGown, executive director of the National Organisation for Albinism and Hypopigmentation, noted that it was the 68th movie since 1960 to feature an albino villain.<br />In the study, researchers looked at the top 10 villains from the American Film Institute\'s \""100 greatest heroes and villains\"" list.<br />Six of the 10 villains featured visible dermatologic conditions.<br />Among those characters were Dr Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic serial killer from The Silence Of The Lambs (1991) and Regan MacNeil, a young girl possessed by the devil in The Exorcist (1973).<br />The most obvious is Star Wars\' Darth Vader, a man so hideously deformed, he wore a mask to hide his visage.<br />A glance down the rest of the list found many more villains with dermatological conditions, such as Freddy Krueger\'s severe scarring in A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) and Cruella de Vil\'s poliosis and deep rhytides in 101 Dalmatians (1996).<br />Using dermatological conditions to symbolise evil was even starker when the top 10 villains were contrasted with the top 10 heroes.<br />Of these heroes, only four showed any sort of cosmetic facial damage - Indiana Jones, Rocky Balboa, Rick Blaine (Casablanca, 1942) and Will Kane (High Noon, 1952).<br />The former two had small facial scars, while the latter sported lacerations inflicted while they were defending some form of \""good\"".<br />The heroes\' scars were different from those of the villains\'.<br />They are much subtler and shorter in length. They are neither created with prosthetic make-up nor commented on during the narrative, unlike the scars of the villains.<br />In addition, each villain has multiple facial scars whereas each hero has a single facial scar.<br />While the study might seem anecdotal, its authors warned that \""the implications... extend beyond the theatre\"".<br />\""Specifically, unfairly targeting dermatologic minorities may contribute to a tendency towards prejudice in our culture and facilitate misunderstanding of particular disease entities among the general public,\"" the study said.<br />Mr Vail Reese, a dermatologist, keeps an entire blog - fittingly named Skinema - dedicated to exploring skin conditions in film.<br />\""The majority of films use skin disease to convey a character\'s devious motivations. Finally, very few films depict characters with skin disease sympathetically,\"" he wrote.<br />\""We must remember that the attitude towards skin disease in movies, to some extent, both reflects and informs the perceptions of our society. Even today, individuals with non-infectious diseases such as psoriasis and vitiligo are treated as if they have the plague.\""<br />Added Mr Reese: \""Skin disease does not represent inherent evil, but rather a difficult and, at times, disabling condition.\""<br />But some recent shows portray skin disease as a disabling condition, rather than shorthand for evil.<br />HBO\'s acclaimed drama The Night Of features a kind-hearted character who suffers from psoriasis. Online magazine Slate called the show \""a star vehicle for eczema\"". One dermatologist told Slate the show \""really resonated\"" with one of her patients.<br />It is too early to know if The Night Of signals a new trend, but dermatologists will be keeping a very close watch.<br />WASHINGTON POST",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEg6HoJP1SVOT3dz0n_V6Iz0o2mCw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779459261865&ei=JCTvWMCdC4LYWbTchLAG&url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/why-do-most-movie-villains-have-bad-skin,EN,,13/04/2017 07:09,2017-04-12 19:00:56+00:00,c12a9781a0,The Straits Times,,,,,1492030856,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42df25ec58,Blu-ray reviews: \'The Robot Chicken Walking Dead Special\' & \'Lego ... - Washington Times,"Blu-ray reviews: \'The Robot Chicken Walking Dead Special\' & \'Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: The Flash\'<br />Here\'s a look at a few animated laugh-fests now available in the Blu-ray format.The Robot Chicken Walking Dead Special: Look Who\'s Walking(Warner Bros[1]. Home Entertainment, rated TV-MA, 22 minutes, 1.78:1 aspect ratio, $19.99) - After I officially declared my favorite AMC post-apocalyptic zombie series had jumped the shark due to some idiotic narrative decisions spearheaded by a former, dunderheaded showrunner, it\'s a welcomed respite to watch the team from Cartoon Network\'s \""Robot Chicken\"" skewer the show.Armed with stop-motion animation, some detailed dolls that Mego collectors would love to get a hold of and a devoted group of artists, leaders Seth Green and Matthew Senreich deliver 22 minutes of hilarity and even manage to assemble the entire cast including Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes), Norman Reedus (Daryl Dixon) and Danai Gurira (Michonne) to speak as those action figures.Specifically, the episode features a loose plot about a curmudgeonly, older version of Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) visiting the U.S. Walking Dead Museum and telling the true story of the Georgia survivors. It ties together over two dozen vignettes covering some key parts of the TV series\' history.Some of the best, belly laugh skits includes a musical number with Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and dancers performing \""the Negan Dip,\"" Hershel Green (Scott Wilson) boxing a kangaroo, Negan meeting Snoopy, and a museum vending machine for \""making your own bullets\"" with Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt) tempting visitors.Also, pay attention for another musical ditty with the cannibals of Terminus led by a singer who sounds oddly like Daniel Radcliffe.I could have easily enjoyed hours of these shenanigans. So here\'s hoping for another round soon of \""Robot Chicken\"" to take a sardonic bite out of the acclaimed, though quickly fading, drama.Best extras: The bonus stuff runs longer than show itself and first includes a pair of optional commentary tracks featuring Mr. Green, Mr. Senreich, writer Tom Sheppard, Mr. McDermitt, \""The Walking Dead\"" showrunner Scott M. Gimple and \""The Walking Dead\"" creator Robert Kirkman. Both tracks feature amusing banter by the group as they try and make each other laugh and occasionally dissect what happening on screen.Next, eight deleted sketches are available in various unrealized form (not fully animated). Creators comment of why the skits were cut and offer moments such as Rick Grimes waking up in a hospital to meet Dr. Patch Adams and Michonne\'s walkers taking part in a round of Double Dutch jump rope.Additionally, featurettes (roughly 12 minutes in total) offer the cast and crew talking about their favorite skits and an overview of the production that even reveals making some of the doll heads using a three-dimensional printer.Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: The Flash(Warner Bros[2]. Home Entertainment, not rated, 78 minutes, 1.78:1 aspect ratio, $24.98) - Those needing an entertaining dose of key members of the Justice League in action should avoid the latest live-action movie and instead dive into this fun adventure based on a familiar block-building universe.Within the wonderfully colorful and intricate Lego virtual universe, the plot focuses on the Fastest Man Alive getting manipulated by his evil doppelganger, the Reverse Flash, stuck in a time loop and forced to live the same day over and over again while learning some life lessons.Humor gleefully overrides drama here with a plot offering laughs at the expense of Justice League members, as they must deal with Flash\'s issues and a few super villains.Comic book fans will quickly appreciate the dive into an amalgam of many Flash storylines tied to the Speed Force as well as watching Dr. Fate and Zatana performing a musical number.Lego fans will go gaga over some of the vehicles displayed including Killer Croc\'s Battle Chomper (really available to build), Doctor Fate\'s spaceship and the Joker\'s suction cup crawler.Equally important, the character-heavy story manages to offer screen time to Lego-ized versions of Batman, Plastic Man, Superman, Cyborg, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Wonder Woman, Penguin, the Atom, and even appearances by Ace the Bat Hound, Green Lantern squirrel B\'dg, Aquaman\'s seahorse Storm and Krypto the Superdog.The visual splendor of presenting a universe created with those famed blocks, as easily destroyed as rebuilt, does not disappoint. The color saturation almost took the cartoon to three dimensions as it popped from the screen.I especially appreciated a miniaturized Atom altering one of Joker\'s laughing gas molecules, Flash eating a doughnut with bright purple frosting, Batman dressed as a clown after getting a blast from Joker\'s fun cannon and a psychedelic trip through the Speed Force tunnel.Suffice it to report: Younger viewers and older fans will be mesmerized.Best extras: Come on, really Warner Bros[3]., nothing? Not even one featurette on the origins of Reverse Flash, the Speed Force, Bat Hound or the Hall of Justice? Other than the digital code, viewers get nothing extra for the purchase of the cartoon. I\'d stick to a rental.The Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

42e94422e1,10 Times the Oscars Got It Right - Esquire.com,"10 Oscar Best Picture Winning Movies That Deserved Awards<br />So how did The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the third part of Peter Jackson\'s groundbreaking adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien\'s beloved fantasy trilogy, manage to not only win Best Picture, but win 11 awards, leveling up with Titanic and Ben Hur for the most awards ever won by one movie?<br />New Line CinemaIt always helps to make money. Jackson\'s trilogy not only earned more than some nations\' Gross National Products, but he paved the way for Hollywood\'s highly lucrative, effects-heavy focus on franchises, adaptations, and cinematic universes. At the same time, Jackson showed how special effects could be used to enhance and modernize that most hallowed of Hollywood genres, the now all-but-extinct Sweeping Historical Epic; take out the wizards and orcs and The Lord of the Rings films aren\'t that far from treasured widescreen tales such as Lawrence of Arabia.It also helps that Jackson\'s film was legitimately great, filled with top-notch acting, story points that paid off in satisfying ways, and emotional beats that made a world of golems and wraiths feel human. Sure, there\'s a thousand endings too many, but this is big budget, epic storytelling at its finest, and Jackson making a compelling argument that effects-heavy genre films deserved to be taken seriously.<br />No Country for Old Men (2007)The Academy mostly snubbed Coen brothers for the first two decades of their career. Classics such as Miller\'s Crossing and Raising Arizona were ignored, Barton Fink received only a handful of smaller nominations, and Fargo lost to The English Patient, which is just absurd.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowClearly, the Best Picture prize for the Coen\'s adaptation of Cormac McCarthy\'s No Country for Old Men was a case of the Academy making things right and finally recognizing the most innovative American directing team of the past three decades.<br />MiramaxBut this award was no mere consolation prize. The film introduced one of cinema\'s all-time most chilling villains with Javier Bardem\'s Anton Chigurh and rebooted Josh Brolin\'s career, and the scene where the two try to out-maneuver each other through a hotel vent is a marvel of tense editing and sustained tension.Most impressively, the Coen\'s stayed true to McCarthy\'s bold, unconventional ending, which ignored audiences\' expectations in favor of driving home the author\'s philosophy on moral rot. Reasonable people can argue if this film is superior to Paul Thomas Anderson\'s There Will Be Blood, which was also nominated in 2007, but no one can reasonably argue that the Coens didn\'t finally earn the trophy for one of their best.<br />The Hurt Locker (2009)The Academy has snubbed auditoriums worth of visionary creators. And until seven years ago, it also snubbed an entire gender, which is an impressive feat of short-sightedness for a voting block keen to pat itself on the back for its progressive beliefs. With The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow finally broke the glass ceiling, becoming the first (and at the moment, only) woman to win both Best Director and to helm a Best Picture.<br />Summit EntertainmentThe Hurt Locker is famously the lowest-grossing film to ever win Best Picture, and also managed to beat Avatar, the highest-grossing picture of all time. How did it pull it off? By turning the Iraq War into a surprisingly intimate chamber drama. Many talented filmmakers stumbled when trying to tell stories about What Iraq Means, whereas Bigelow explores the toll the war has on one man (a revelatory Jeremy Renner), and why he can\'t seem to bring himself to say no to fight, despite the family he has back home.Bigelow is a master of the action film, and the explosions and battle scenes are as intense as anything you\'ll ever see, but what lingers in your mind is the climactic look of both shame and relief on Renner\'s face when he finally accepts his mortality and runs for safety rather than dying in a blaze of glory. This wasn\'t just a film about war-this was a film about why men fight it, and that\'s why it stood out.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGev_UXrNkByoT_bjWm5y8f0KD6JA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779389437990&ei=SUetWKhGwaJY7Z2Z4AY&url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a53279/oscar-best-picture-winning-movies/,EN,,22/02/2017 08:09,2017-02-21 15:15:00+00:00,8742bf891f,Esquire.com,,,,,1487693700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42ef9319b6,Listen To A Pair Of Jerry Garcia\'s Earliest Known Recordings - JamBase,"Listen To A Pair Of Jerry Garcia\'s Earliest Known Recordings<br />Jerry Garcia\'s earliest known performances have been collected for the upcoming extensive box Before The Dead, due out on Round Records on May 11. Huffington Post premiered a pair of tracks from the upcoming release which are among the earliest known recordings of the future Grateful Dead co-founder.<br />The forthcoming five-LP limited edition and four-CD archival project includes recordings made by Garcia from 1961 to the summer of 1964. The collection presents Garcia performing with Sara Ruppenthal Katz (Garcia\'s first wife), and as a member of the bands Black Mountain Boys, Hart Valley Drifters, Asphalt Jungle Mountain Boys and Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers. Accompanying the music is a 32-page book presenting track-by-track essays, listening notes, other essays, rare photos and memorabilia. Author and Grateful Dead publicist Dennis McNally and documentarian Brian Miksis co-produced and curated Before The Dead, which also includes Miksis\' extensive liner notes. <br />Huffington Post premiered Garcia and his career-spanning writing partner Robert Hunter performing at their friend Brigid Meier\'s 16th birthday party on May 26, 1961, in Menlo Park, California. According to HuffPost, \""Meier\'s father worked at the Stanford Research Institute and had access to their Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorder,\"" which led to his taping an 18-year-old Garcia.<br />\""As you listen to this and as you listen to people listen to him, you realize that at 18, he had this presence,\"" McNally told Huffington Post. \""People were just glued to him.

42f720ec68,"Ranchers, loggers express concerns about forest plans - California Farm Bureau","Ranchers, loggers express concerns about forest plans<br />By Dennis Pollock <br />Concerns over tree health and possible new restrictions on grazing and logging surfaced during the final public meeting on plans to reshape management of the Inyo, Sequoia and Sierra national forests.<br />A day after the final meeting, the California Farm Bureau Federation filed a request with the U.S. Forest Service to extend the deadline for submitting comments on the plans. A 90-day comment period is scheduled to end Aug. 25.<br />At the public meeting, held in Clovis last week, participants expressed opinions on topics that ranged from recreation to sustainability and watershed viability.<br />The meeting drew participants from well beyond the Sierra National Forest region where it was conducted, because of their concern that management updates for that region and for the Sequoia and Inyo forests could become a template for national forests statewide.<br />Among them was Eloise Fischer, who has held grazing allotments in the Stanislaus National Forest for nearly 50 years. She said the updates \""could reduce the number (of animals) you could graze; they could shorten the 90-day grazing period, making it uneconomical.\"" She said another concern is reductions in grazing because of endangered-species restrictions.<br />Bart Topping, whose cattle graze on Sierra National Forest land, described the challenges of moving cattle out of a meadow in the Bass Lake District due to restrictions related to the Yosemite toad.<br />Participants were encouraged to engage in what was termed \""informal discussion\"" with staff members. Those at the meeting were able to visit three \""information stations\"" that centered on topics that included recreation, fire risk and restoration, and wildlife and vegetation information.<br />CFBF Second Vice President Tony Toso, who attended the Clovis meeting, said he considered it unfortunate there was not a discussion group specifically focused on topics such as grazing and logging.<br />Toso is a partner in a cow-calf operation in Hornitos, but does not graze his cattle in the national forest. He said thinning of trees in the forests is vital.<br />\""Thinning the forests not only helps reduce fire hazards, but preserves water and allows more grass to grow. It doesn\'t get shaded out and offers more feed to the cattle, so it helps the meadows by providing cattle with more feed sources,\"" Toso said.<br />At least two members of county boards of supervisors attended the Clovis meeting.<br />They included Allen Ishida, a Tulare County supervisor, who talked of the importance of the forest as a watershed: \""Sixty percent of our water comes from there. What will they do if the forest burns? Let it go to chaparral?\""<br />He pointed out that dense forests take more water, and he favors introducing sheep and goats in forestland to remove dense vegetation.<br />Randy Hanvelt, a member of the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors, noted it could take two years to put plans in place that would guide management of the forests for another 15 years. He said plans need to be more forward-looking and should take into account all the damaged trees.<br />\""This is being driven by scheduling, and we need to get it right,\"" said Hanvelt, who represents a county in which 75 percent of the land is in a national forest.<br />Shaun Crook, president of the Tuolumne County Farm Bureau, attended an earlier meeting in Clovis, expressing his concerns about a rule that trees larger than 30 inches cannot be felled.<br />\""It makes no sense,\"" said Crook, who is a logging contractor and real estate broker. \""They\'re neglecting current on-the-ground conditions.\""<br />Neil McDougald, a University of California natural resources farm advisor emeritus, said he believes livestock grazing and forest thinning have an important role in maintaining forest health and avoiding fires.<br />\""It\'s not just the dying trees; they need to manage the live trees,\"" he said. \""It\'s out of balance.\""<br />The multiple-use mandate for national forests includes promoting rural economic development. Some speakers at last week\'s meeting described the closures through the years of sawmills in the region, including ones in Dinuba, North Fork, Auberry and Madera. Meanwhile, the Sierra Forest Products mill in Terra Bella has cut back from a double shift to a single shift.<br />The California Farm Bureau is tracking the plan-revision process because its members hold permits to graze livestock and harvest timber, among other uses of the forest. CFBF has taken the position that the draft plans do not adequately address the severe tree mortality California is experiencing.<br />It also says the draft environmental impact statement fails to discuss California\'s declining biomass power plant industry. Without these power plants, it says, wood waste from wildfires, insects and disease will have to be piled and burned.<br />In a letter requesting the time extension for comments on the forest plans, CFBF Associate Counsel Jack Rice said \""additional time is important to allowing those in rural communities affected by the new plans sufficient time to develop more meaningful comments.\""<br />CFBF Federal Policy consultant Erin Huston said people who work in forestry, livestock production and rural recreation are busiest during the summer.<br />\""People who will be directly affected by these documents need time to review them thoroughly,\"" Huston said. \""Because decisions about these three forests could set precedents for the whole state, it\'s important to take the time to be sure their voices are heard.\""<br />The CFBF letter said the main reason to provide additional time is the \""sheer volume of the material to be reviewed. The (draft environmental impact statement) and three draft forest plans comprise approximately 2,000 pages, with supporting documents made available in late May adding thousands more pages.\""<br />People who attended the Clovis meeting could take home with them documents on the proposed revisions that weighed about 9 pounds.<br />In a telephone interview, Sean Curtis, a director of the Modoc County Farm Bureau, said it has been a challenge for those who graze livestock to wade through the massive paperwork \""to find one paragraph that could turn things upside down.\""<br />Comments on the plan may be submitted online at http://tinyurl.com/r5comment[1], by postal mail to Planning Team Leader, Forest Plan Revision, 1323 Club Drive, Vallejo, CA 94592 or by email to r5planrevison@fs.fed.us[2].<br />(Dennis Pollock is a reporter in Fresno.

42fd8586ff,Have a business mindset to succeed in poultry keeping - Daily Nation - Daily Nation,"Have a business mindset to succeed in poultry keeping<br />By SUBIRI OBWOGOMore by this Author<br />In case you\'re struggling with many farming ideas and wondering which one to go for, you\'re certainly not alone. In fact, this is a nagging question for most budding entrepreneurs. If you\'re struggling to tell a fertile egg from an infertile one, I have a table to help you interpret results of a common technique known as candling. If you are wondering if maggots are good for your chicken, I have a concrete answer for you. Mukami Rimberia: The more I read your articles, the more I appreciate the skills and knowledge gaps in animal production and in agribusiness.  I think many people venture into farming without sufficient knowledge and use \'kienyeji\' methods and techniques that often don\'t work. I wish we could get to a point where we seek professional advice and follow it through. As a matter of fact, access to capital and knowledge in animal husbandry and agronomy are not enough for one to become a successful farmer. <br />Today, being a successful farmer also requires one to have a business mindset and entrepreneurial knowledge and skills. Second, we must invest in and nurture growth-oriented enterprises, including agribusinesses for the sector to transform the economy and create jobs. According to Bloomberg, eight out of 10 start-ups fail within the first 18 months. Stephen Kimani: What causes leg paralysis in chickens? There are several causes of lameness (weakness/paralysis) in chicken. These include diseases caused by viruses (viral arthritis and Marek\'s disease) and bacteria (mycoplasama and staphylococcus). There are also nutritional conditions like rickets and cage layer fatigue syndrome. Please get in touch with a vet near you.Muksie Farming Inc., Kamulu: Although I\'m a pig farmer, I\'ve become increasingly drawn to other farm animals such as Kienyeji chickens, goats, ducks and fish. My sister, Ivy, has even enticed me with a ready market for Kienyeji chicken in Nairobi City. Recently, my good neighbour, Baba Mike, visited and introduced me to maggot farming for feeding chicken and fish. Although my passion is still in pigs, I\'m now spoilt for choice. Please advise. First, it\'s okay to have multiple business ideas to try out. Please, don\'t let these ideas die. Second, distinguish between a start-up and an established business.Kienyeji Kenya Ltd chart for distinguishing between fertile and infertile eggs using candling technique. TABLE | COURTESYThe former is not a smaller version of the latter. A start-up must experiment with different ideas (maggots, fish, pigs and chickens, among others) in order to find the right product-market mix that established firms would already have.In fact, experimenting with ideas is what I\'ve been doing at Kienyeji Kenya Ltd in the last three years. The limiting factor for trying out many ideas at a go would be availability of resources. If you\'ve enough resources, then experiment with all these ideas at ago (but start on a small-scale to learn as you go along to minimise loses). The bottom line is that you win some battles and lose others. Entrepreneurs are always ready to try and fail while figuring out what works and what doesn\'t and for that, you\'ll require unrelenting fortitude. As the saying goes, a calm sea never made a skilled sailor. Third, seek advice where possible but do not listen to naysayers who will offer discouraging comments like: \""This can\'t work,\"" or \""It\'s been tried before and it didn\'t work.\""Connie: I read somewhere that maggots are good for feeding chickens. The use of insects or their larvae as a source of animal proteins and for feeding chicken has been tried and shown to save costs. Animal protein (fish meal, feather meal and bone meal) is richer than plant protein (soya meal, sunflower cake). It contains more essential amino acids and micronutrients. That is why I always include at least one animal protein in my poultry feeds. I also read somewhere that the larvae of an insect known as Black Soldier Fly (BSFL) has been tested and found to be a promising source of nutrients in poultry and fish. It contains up to 42 per cent protein, 35 per cent fat and essential amino acids and minerals. In some countries, BSFL has substituted soya meal and fish meal in poultry feeds. Joash Nyagisera: I\'ve a problem identifying fertile eggs to give to a broody hen. Recently, I lost 60 eggs. Explain how to use egg candling to isolate infertile ones. Candling should be done only on day seven and 14 after incubation.

She visited Washington, D.C., to discuss how the clinic has lost funding because it would not agree to the terms of President Trump\'s executive order banning U.S. aid to any health organization in another country that provides, advocates or makes referrals for abortions.<br />Emily Matthews/NPR<br />hide caption<br />toggle caption<br />Emily Matthews/NPR<br />Melvine Ouyo is a reproductive health nurse at Family Health Options Kenya. She visited Washington, D.C., to discuss how the clinic has lost funding because it would not agree to the terms of President Trump\'s executive order banning U.S. aid to any health organization in another country that provides, advocates or makes referrals for abortions.<br />Emily Matthews/NPR<br />On Jan. 23, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order that bans U.S. aid to any health organization in another country that provides, advocates or makes referrals for abortions. The full impact of the order won\'t be felt until September. That\'s when the U.S. government fiscal year comes to an end. At that point, every international organization that does not comply with the order will be excluded from U.S. funding, says Marjorie Newman-Williams, president of Marie Stopes International, an organization that provides contraception and safe abortion in dozens of countries. But health groups that aren\'t complying with the policy are already feeling the effects. The U.S. has pulled the plug on funds that had been previously allocated but not yet spent prior to the Trump order. \""Marie Stopes can talk about its own sad stories of programs that have had to close,\"" says Newman-Williams. Its outreach services, which were funded by USAID in countries like Uganda, Kenya, Senegal, Madagascar, Pakistan and Myanmar, have already stopped, she says. That\'s the case for Family Health Options Kenya, Kenya\'s oldest provider of sexual and reproductive health services. FHOK disagreed with the terms of the \""Mexico City\"" policy, which has been reinstated by every Republican president since Ronald Reagan first issued it. <br />In October 2017, $640,000 that was in a four-year pipeline for ongoing work was lost because the funds, which came from the President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, were discontinued. Since then, $1.56 million more has been lost because FHOK was unable to renew project funds and bid for future U.S. funding, says Amos Simpano, director of clinical services. FHOK says that amounts to nearly 60 percent of the organization\'s funding. On a visit to Washington, D.C., this spring, Melvine Ouyo, an FHOK reproductive health nurse, sat down with NPR to discuss the effects of losing that much funding. One of the organization\'s 14 clinics has closed down, and a clinic in Kibera, Nairobi\'s largest slum and where Ouyo works, could be next. FHOK has also ceased outreach services to underprivileged communities, which it estimates has affected more than 76,000 women and young girls to date. Though abortion is legal under Kenyan law if the health or well-being of the mother is at risk, some pregnant women and girls who now lack access to medical care because of the funding cuts are resorting to unsafe measures out of desperation. They visit \""curtain clinics,\"" she says - secret spaces run by people who aren\'t nurses or doctors - or use household items like crochet needles to terminate their pregnancies. The loss of funding has also jeopardized essential services that are unrelated to abortion - like cancer screening of reproductive organs, treatment for HIV, postnatal care and vaccinations for diseases. The funding policy - called the \""global gag rule\"" by its critics - is meant to discourage abortion. But a Stanford University study makes the case that restricting family planning funds can lead to more abortions. Researchers analyzed survey data in 20 African countries between 1994 and 2008 and found that rates of induced abortions rose sharply in countries that were most affected by the rule. A report by Population Action International found that when the policy was in effect between 1984 and 1992, \""there was no evidence that the policy reduced the incidence of abortion.\"" Ouyo was in the United States to attend Capitol Hill Days, a conference around reproductive rights that is hosted by Population Connection Action Fund. When she sat down with NPR, she said the decision not to comply with the Trump order was made by the International Planned Parenthood Federation, of which FHOK is a member organization. \""It was a worthwhile decision, though it has negative consequences,\"" she says. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Tell me about how this has affected the clinic you work at in Kibera. We had to lay off six staff [out of 10] just to be able to sustain the clinic. We also have not been able to acquire any [new] equipment in the past several months because of a lack of funding. We have not improved any of our equipment [such as autoclaving machines used to sterilize equipment]. It means we are still just operating from where we were last year. What health problems do you see going unaddressed? Because we have not been able to provide outreach services, which basically serve disadvantaged communities, we cannot provide screening services for HIV and AIDS and be able to initiate treatment for those who test positive, and provide health education [for prevention]. It means that people in these communities will live without any precaution. A child who requires immunization and [whose] parents may not be able to afford transport to facilities [could] get communicable diseases - measles, TB, diphtheria, hepatitis. And if one gets it, they infect another and another in the community. <br />Who are some of the people that rely on your clinic? There was a young orphan girl, about 10 years old, who was sleeping at her uncle\'s [home] after she lost her parents. And the uncle persistently sexually abused her. And when she got pregnant at 13 years, this is a pregnancy from incest, she would not just carry on the pregnancy. So this girl comes to you suicidal. What do you do as a professional? She had already attempted unsafe abortion. She had taken herbs given [to her] by friends. Her friends referred her to us and she was able to access safe abortion services. With the funding loss, what is FHOK doing to survive? We have to put a small fee on the services we are providing. It has caused the clients to shy away from seeking care. At the Kibera clinic, we are charging half a dollar, because it is within the slum and we know the clientele we are dealing with. And still, not all will be able to pay. We feel the pain of not being able to provide those services. <br />Other countries, like the Netherlands, have started raising funds to help international organizations that are suffering because they did not agree to the terms of the Trump order. The Dutch government created a funding initiative called \""She Decides\"" and has raised about $200 million from governments, foundations and philanthropists. Are you receiving funding from elsewhere? The main alternative that FHOK started was to start charging the client. We receive a reduced grant [by about $99,000] from the International Planned Parenthood Foundation. What does it feel like for you right now? It feels painful knowing that someone would benefit from your education, your passion, your career and you cannot do that. It kills your morale. How do you cope, knowing that your health clinic isn\'t as effective today? Just like the previous years when we had the global gag order, I still have this hope that I have to hold on, to press on.

43727df781,Alligator spotted with dead body in its mouth in Florida lake - RT,"Alligator spotted with dead body in its mouth in Florida lake - RT Viral<br />Police are searching for a huge alligator in Lakeland, Florida, after it was spotted roaming a lake while carrying a human corpse in its mouth.<br />Lakeland Police were alerted to the incident by a worker at Florida Presbyterian Homes, a nearby retirement community, who spotted the gator in Lake Hunter at around 1:40 p.m., according to local station WFLA [1].Police attending the scene saw the alligator with the body in its mouth before releasing the remains and swimming off.The body has been identified as male and is believed to have been in the water for more than one day, according to a police statement[2].READ MORE: Alligator bites off arm of Florida man trying to flee the cops[3] Police are still trying to establish if the man, whose identity is unknown, was killed by the alligator or if he had died before being snatched by the reptile.A contract trapper for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Officers captured a nine-foot alligator Tuesday night, but it is unclear if this is the same gator.Its stomach will be examined to determine if it swallowed any human body parts. If it is ruled out, the search for the gator involved in the incident will resume.Police revealed they received two other alerts regarding an alligator in the area earlier this week, but did not find anything upon investigating.On June 4, a person reported finding a shirt in the water, with a pair of pants and backpack, nearby at the Lake Hunter Boar Ramp, and also noted there was an aggressive alligator by the boat ramp during the week.On June 5, local police received a call from a person who said they had observed an alligator circling something large floating in the lake.Just last week, a similarly chilling discovery[4] was made by two fishermen who came upon two alligators eating a human body in the Florida Everglades. Police said they did not believe the alligators killed the person and were instead treating the case as homicide.There have been 337 alligator attacks, including 17 fatal ones, in Florida since 1948 - the highest figure in the country, according to the database StateMaster.[5]Two deaths were caused by alligators in Florida last year, including that of a burglary suspect hiding from police.READ MORE: Instant karma: Suspected burglar eaten alive by alligator while hiding from police [6]Prior to that, the most recent gator-related death recorded in the state was in 2007.References^ WFLA (wfla.com)^ police statement (www.lakelandgov.net)^ READ MORE: Alligator bites off arm of Florida man trying to flee the cops (www.rt.com)^ chilling discovery (www.sun-sentinel.com)^ StateMaster.

438887fc92,Irish health minister working on proposed new abortion law - WHIO,"Irish health minister defends abortion ban referendum<br />Published: Tuesday, January 30, 2018 @ 8:36 AMUpdated: Tuesday, January 30, 2018 @ 8:35 AM <br />By: <br />The Associated Press<br />LONDON <br />- Irish women are having abortions regardless of a near-total constitutional ban on terminating pregnancies, the country\'s health minister said Tuesday in defense of a planned referendum that will ask voters whether the amendment should be repealed.Health Minister Simon Harris said on Ireland\'s RTE television that he is beginning work on a proposed abortion law that would be submitted to parliament if the May referendum removes the constitutional ban. The legislation would allow abortions during the first trimester, he said.\""Whether the Eighth Amendment is in our Constitution, or indeed not in our Constitution, abortion is a reality for Irish women,\"" Harris said. \""I cannot close my eyes and block my ears to the fact that 3,265 of our citizens travelled to the U.K. in 2016\"" for abortions they could not obtain legally in Ireland.Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar announced Monday that the referendum to be held in late May will ask voters if they want to keep the anti-abortion amendment or repeal it so parliament can consider new legislation. The replacement law only would be put forward if voters support repeal.The amendment enacted by referendum in 1983 makes predominantly Roman Catholic Ireland the most restrictive country in Europe on abortion. It commits authorities to defend equally \""the right to life of the unborn\"" and \""the equal right to life of the mother.\"" Abortion is legal only when a woman\'s life is in danger.Varadkar, who leads the center-right Fine Gael party, said he would campaign to ease the abortion ban. It represents a change of heart for the prime minister, who had earlier described himself as anti-abortion.\""This is now a matter for the Irish people. It is in their hands. I think it is right that Irish people should be asked this question,\"" he told parliament TuesdayThe U.N. Human Rights Committee said in a 29-page report in 2016 that Ireland\'s abortion ban subjects women to discriminatory, cruel and degrading treatment. The committee of experts from 17 countries said the amendment violated the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.It called on Ireland immediately to allow abortions in cases involving fatal fetal abnormalities.Cora Sherlock, a leader of Irish anti-abortion group Pro Life Campaign, said the Eighth Amendment prevents about 5,000 abortions each year. Her group maintains the referendum is anti-democratic.\""This would give the people of Ireland the chance to remove a human right, removing the right to life of babies in their mothers\' womb,\"" Sherlock said. \""This should not happen in a democracy.\""Opponents say the ban puts women at risk.Linda Kavanagh, a volunteer spokeswoman with the Abortion Rights Campaign group, said the 1983 amendment had made it difficult for health professionals to provide the best care for women with complicated pregnancies.Kavanagh thinks public sentiment in Ireland has changed, as shown by the 2015 referendum vote that legalized same-sex marriage.\""I think Ireland is moving away from its dark history of trying to control women\'s bodies,\"" she said. \""We are a Catholic country. I know a lot of countries are looking at us. The world is watching.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGflDVZVDY-mO6TXJ2c-PpJPcqEdw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779783941276&ei=qMlyWriBMci-W9PNsfAN&url=http://www.whio.com/news/world/irish-health-minister-working-proposed-new-abortion-law/703WxgbvRTbi65AYyngQ2L/,EN,,01/02/2018 08:00,2018-01-30 12:36:50+00:00,6df579530d,WHIO,,,,,1517319410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43a3d8531b,"Congress, slew of state issues get decided Tuesday too - USA TODAY","Congress, slew of state issues get decided Tuesday too<br />John Stossel, Creators Syndicate<br />3:01 p.m. EDT November 4, 2016John Stossel(Photo: STEVE FENN)The presidency isn\'t the only choice next week. There are more issues than \""Who\'s worse, Trump or Clinton?\""Other important things are on the ballot. Congressional elections may determine whether Obamacare lives or dies.Electionbettingodds.com currently says Republicans will hold the House but lose the Senate. But it\'s close. And politicians aren\'t the whole story.In Kansas and Indiana, voters will decide whether the \""right to hunt and fish\"" should be protected by their state constitutions. Advocates say such a right is needed because zealots will keep inventing \""endangered\"" species and new gun restrictions until most hunting and fishing is impossible.For similar reasons, Oklahoma voters will vote on a ballot measure guaranteeing a \""right to farm.\""Several states will allow voters to punish their neighbors on Tuesday by imposing \""sin\"" taxes. Politicians like taxing \""sin\"" because it gives them money while letting them claim that they discourage bad behavior.So, four states offer ballot measures that would raise tobacco taxes.Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey vote on whether to expand legal gambling but only state-run gambling. In Rhode Island, 61 percent of the revenue will be kept by the state. State-run gambling is always a bad bet, but government will really screw you in Rhode Island.I\'m surprised politicians stop at gambling and don\'t tax all the Bible\'s deadly sins: pride, envy, lust, etc. Probably because politicians don\'t want to tax themselves. Californians will vote on expansion of a counterproductive rule: a ban on plastic bags. Its supporters say it reduces litter and protects oceans and wildlife. As usual, the zealots ignore science, convenience and health.A canvas reusable bag must be used 131 times before it will compensate for the minor environmental impact of plastic bags.Most reusable bags get contaminated by bacteria. The government tells us to carefully wash reusable bags but almost no one does.So California voters are likely to vote themselves increased health risk, bad smells and higher costs - for no real environmental benefit.In Massachusetts, voters are likely to prohibit keeping pigs, calves and hens in spaces where they \""can\'t lie down or turn around freely.\"" This may improve animals\' lives. I write \""may\"" because more space also leads to more fighting - even cannibalism - among animals.But the new law will triple the amount of space farmers need. That raises costs. Egg prices increased 22 percent after California passed such a law.On Tuesday, Washington may vote to impose a carbon tax on itself. It won\'t have a noticeable effect on climate change, but it will make enviro-zealots feel better.Fortunately, Tuesday also offers voters some good choices. Nevada voters may choose to open their state\'s energy market to competition. Competition lowers costs. I was surprised to see that unions oppose that. Do unions now oppose everything that\'s good?Four states will get to vote on legalizing medical marijuana, and five vote on whether to legalize weed for all adults. The betting suggests that most of these measures will pass.These are issues Americans disagree about - and it\'s good we don\'t have to wait for Washington, D.C., to reach agreement about them. Innovation often comes from state experiments.Abortion and gay marriage were first legalized by states. Likewise, women first got the vote in Wyoming. Only after that did other states, and the federal government, follow.James Madison, chief architect of the Constitution, would have approved. He wanted leeway given to state governments. In the Federalist Papers, in words that would be partly echoed in the Constitution, Madison wrote, \""The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\""Since then, arrogant presidents and other federal officials have taken powers from the states. That leaves Americans fewer choices.But the states will prove again on Tuesday that they still have a say, even if we\'re stuck with President Hillary Clinton for the next four (or eight?! please no!) years.John Stossel is host of \""Stossel\"" on Fox News and author of \""No They Can\'t!

43b200202e,Local charity makes a difference in Haiti - Spring Hill Home Page - Spring Hill Home Page,"Local charity makes a difference in Haiti<br />by Kendall Webb<br />From her home in Thompson\'s Station, Tennessee, Bronwen Pope remained in close contact via cell phone and social media with friends in Cayes-Jacmel on Haiti\'s southern coast as the powerful Category 4 hurricane quickly approached the small village.<br />\""And then everything went silent,\"" Pope says reflecting on those late evening hours of October 3 before Hurricane Matthew blazed a deadly trail across the island nation.<br />Lubien Fils, who lives in Cayes-Jacmel and serves as the director of the school, had tried to reassure Pope on one of those calls when she asked what they were doing to prepare. \""We are praying,\"" he said.<br />\""I was like \'you have to do more than pray!\"" she says recalling her frantic response to Fils. \""What are you thinking? You have to do more!\""<br />Pope\'s thoughts then drifted from the comforts of her Williamson County home to the remote Caribbean seaside village she first visited in September of 2011 as part of a medical relief team. She helped lead the group with Kay VanFleteren, her friend from nursing school who lives in Franklin, and it was here at the urging of a Haitian friend from the village that the two Williamson County residents agreed to fund - out of their own pockets - a Christian day school that now stands in Cayes-Jacmel.<br />Photos by Bill Jorgenson<br />That, in turn, led to the founding of Trezò, a Williamson County-based 501(c)(3) charitable organization with a mission to support the ongoing education of children in Haiti and help their families and communities. Having made the trip from Middle Tennessee many times in the five years since then, Pope reflected on the community\'s modest resources and primitive habitations and, for the first time, the reality of the situation hit home.<br />\""When your roof is a tarp or your roof is bamboo, there\'s nowhere to go, there\'s nothing to do,\"" Pope says. \""You can\'t go to the lumber store and start battening down your hatches. You pray, and that\'s really all you can do is pray and wait it out.\""<br />Kay koule twonpe solèy, men li pa twonpe lapli. - A Haitian proverb<br />\""A leaky roof can fool the sun but it can\'t fool the rain.\""<br />More than 1,500 miles away from Williamson County, Fils and his fellow villagers in Cayes-Jacmel were actually doing a little more than just praying.<br />\""When the community and I heard that the Hurricane Matthew was approaching, we were so scared because the homes are not okay,\"" Fils says. \""Many homes (are) too close to the sea. The roofs are not okay. They leak and some of them just get tarps or palm tree leaves on the top.\""<br />So Fils hid all of his important papers deep in the ground in plastic bags. He stressed to his fellow residents the importance of securing food, charcoal, water and other essential stocks. He continued to monitor radio stations and the internet sharing the latest information on the storm\'s progress with the community.<br />Then, finally, with the first signs of Matthew\'s arrival, like everybody else, he returned to the relative safety of his concrete-block home.<br />Lespwa fè viv. - A Haitian proverb<br />\""Where there\'s hope, there\'s life.\""<br />Hurricane Matthew crashed into the coastline of Haiti\'s southwestern peninsula in the early morning hours of October 4. Cayes-Jacmel was spared a direct hit, but for roughly 24 hours, Pope, who still serves as one of Trezò\'s founding board members here in Williamson County along with her husband Bill, sent messages with no response from Fils or anybody else in the village.<br />VanFleteren, Pope\'s friend who also serves on the board with her husband Bob, was monitoring the news for potential updates, too.<br />\""Some of the other people, like in Port-au-Prince, had quicker access to the internet and were posting that they were safe,\"" Kay VanFleteren says. \""So we were getting some reports in but nothing from our area. I just remember calling Fils, calling Fils, calling Fils, and finally, one time he answered and it was like \'yes!\' and Bob and I started kinda tearing up.<br />\""It was just good to hear that there was no significant damage and nobody injured. It was a huge relief.\""<br />Dèyè mòn gen mòn. - A Haitian proverb<br />\""Beyond the mountains, more mountains.\""<br />There are 29 different types of 501(c) nonprofit organizations defined by the Internal Revenue Code, and the most common type is the 501(c)(3). These organizations are either private charities (like Trezò) or private foundations, and some of the more widely known are household names.<br />Major national and international organizations like the American Red Cross, Goodwill and The Salvation Army.<br />Many of them, however, are small organizations of which you\'ve never heard. There were more than 1.4 million exempt organizations as recently as 2012 according to the Urban Institute\'s National Center for Charitable Statistics, and many of them fill a niche in a specific community that might otherwise be overlooked by those larger organizations.<br />Like Williamson County\'s Trezò.<br />Pope and her husband Bill first became involved with Haiti back in 2003-04 when they adopted two young boys from the country, one of whom was abandoned due to minor medical issues.<br />\""During the adoptions, I think I realized that while adoption is something that is needed, even more so, I think is helping to keep families together,\"" Pope says. With many other Haitian children abandoned over medical issues, she was inspired to return to nursing school where she met VanFleteren.<br />VanFleteren, meanwhile, had worked with refugees in Middle Tennessee including some of the Lost Boys of Sudan. Her interest in refugee work led to an interest in Haiti as well when the country was left in shambles by the catastrophic earthquake of 2010. Wanting to see the situation up close, she and Pope joined a medical mission together and visited the country to assist with recovery efforts.<br />\""When I went after the earthquake, we were right in Port-au-Prince and there were millions, literally millions of people living in tents,\"" VanFleteren says. \""Everywhere you drove there was a tent city.\""<br />Anpil men chay pa lou. - A Haitian proverb<br />\""Many hands make the load lighter.\""<br />A year later, the two friends returned to Haiti as the leaders of another relief mission in 2011, and that\'s where they visited Cayes-Jacmel for the first time. It was there that Trezò was born, and like Pope, VanFleteren and her husband Bob have made the trip from Williamson County to Cayes-Jacmel many times since. That includes a trip following Hurricane Matthew\'s visit last October.<br />\""I was a little embarrassed to learn that things were a lot worse than they had conveyed to us,\"" Bob VanFleteren says, \""and that we might have overestimated our sense of relief.\""<br />Virtually all of the crops in the village were lost along with any livestock like goats, cattle and chickens. And while the school building Trezò helped to build over the years held up well, there was widespread damage to homes and the other rudimentary structures that the village depends on.<br />\""What was most apparent was just with all the flying debris and stuff, they had a lot of roofs that were punctured or just shot ... they were ruined,\"" Bob says. \""And so with every successive rain then, people were pretty miserable. They couldn\'t get dry; they couldn\'t get away from it.\""<br />Photo by Bob VanFleteren\""So on that trip we were able to rebuild a number of homes and hang new roofs on homes and bless people there with something a lot more secure than they had even before the storm.\""<br />The community has avoided the widespread cholera outbreaks that have affected neighboring communities, and Trezò\'s early focus on repairing homes and replacing roofs has reduced the likelihood of standing water in homes that might otherwise become breeding grounds for bacteria and the mosquitos that help spread diseases like cholera.<br />But the community isn\'t out of the water yet.<br />\""My guess, having had my eyes on it, was that I think it\'s actually going to be worse for those people in January, February,\"" Bob says, \""because it\'s going to be then that the markets are completely out of food. And it\'s going to be really time to scrounge.\""<br />Timoun fe richès, malere. - A Haitian proverb<br />\""Children are the treasure of the poor.\""<br />Haitian creole is the only language spoken by most Haitians, and it is filled with colorful proverbs and other metaphors that speakers of the language use frequently. The word \'trezò\' itself is a Haitian creole word that means \'treasure\' - a nod to one of the popular proverbs that says \""children are the treasure (or the wealth) of the poor.\""<br />Children prayingIn a country where 54 percent of the inhabitants live in abject poverty according to the CIA\'s World Factbook, possessions of value are few and far between. But in a country where 96 percent of the population identifies as Christian (80 percent Catholic and 16 percent Protestant according to the Factbook), children are seen as gifts from God representing a family\'s true wealth and its hope for the future.<br />Trezò\'s primary mission is focused on those children and their communities, but Matthew has presented the organization with its biggest challenge yet.<br />\""We had just built a fifth and sixth grade class,\"" Pope says. \""Things were expanding, we started building a fence, and we\'re hoping to put solar power in and be able to have laptops and things like that so the kids can learn computers.<br />\""We were growing and building, and of course, then the hurricane hit so we\'ve kinda stopped all that and now our focus has been on recovery in the community.\""<br />While Trezò ultimately remains committed to its original vision, Fils is quick to acknowledge the importance of the current focus on recovery. He and the community in Cayes-Jacmel are grateful for the help that Trezò has provided - much of it through the donations and volunteer efforts of Williamson County residents who support the local organization.<br />\""(Trezò is) paying for carpenters to cover the roofs for the poor families,\"" Fils says. \""They had some tins on their roofs that were there for more than 15 years. You can imagine how leaked are these tins. They couldn\'t even sleep well when it was raining, but Trezò help them fixing their roofs.

43bc4ee4e6,"Feed mills mixing errors cause monensin toxicity in horses; Neb., mill caught error early resulting in no deaths - Fence Post","Feed mills mixing errors cause monensin toxicity in horses; Neb., mill caught error early resulting in no deaths<br />As fall and winter roll in, horse owners are stocking up on hay and grain from local feed stores, with plans to increase the rations until Mother Nature brings back some green grass. But the simple task of purchasing and feeding is not without risks, and some owners unknowingly purchase feeds that are poisonous to horses.While feed-associated poisonings are still relatively rare, they can occur, in some instances causing death. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is charged with monitoring co-ops and feed mills to ensure that feeds sold are safe for the intended species.In October, FDA issued warning letters to two feed mills, Gilman Co-Op Creamery in Gilman, Minn., and Farmers/Ranchers Cooperative Association in Ainsworth, Neb., for feed containing monensin. Monensin is an animal drug approved for use in cattle and poultry that, according to FDA, is highly toxic and potentially lethal to horses, even at relatively low levels.The FDA warning letters come from feed mixed in 2017 according to Farmers/Ranchers Co-op, a business celebrating 101 years. While the feed at Gilman was a special mixed blend according to reports, farmers did not mix monensin in with its blend. Jennifer L. Young, PhD, Farmers/Ranchers consulting nutritionist said the traces found in their feeds were small, and carryover from other grains mixed, showing up at 4.2 parts per million (ppm). Farmers/Ranchers was quick to recall the feeds, and to date, there have been no reports of issues.\""We, as an industry, as a whole, have been very careful,\"" Young said. \""Studies have shown that horses can ingest a certain amount of monensin without any ill effects.\""\""Of non-target species, horses appear to be the most sensitive to ionophore toxicoses. However, there is a threshold level of exposure in horses below which no adverse effects have been observed. Consumption by horses of a feedlot ration containing 33 ppm of monensin resulted in no evidence of toxicity in horses,\"" according to Elanco, a producer of a monensin product, and a 1996 monensin review.Recommended Stories For YouBut FDA is on the watch to make sure firms adhere to regulations for medicated feed mills. Medicated feeds have specific requirements and prodicals for sequencing and require adequate equipment cleanout procedures when switching from mixing a medicated animal food to a non-medicated one. These regulations are designed to prevent unsafe cross-contamination between medicated feed and non-medicated feed or other medicated feed.RISK FOR HORSESThe Gilman case was a little more severe, with the death of multiple horses. According to FDA, the horses consumed feed from a single batch of special-order horse food that was supposed to be non-medicated, be was later found to contain monensin.On June 9 a farm owner in Gilman, Minn., reported that a horse became ill and unable to stand after consuming feed mixed by Gilman Co-Op Creamery, the FDA said in a written statement. Two days later the horse was euthanized.On July 12, two other horses were discovered laying down in their pasture, unable to stand. One horse died that day and the other was discovered dead the following day. Three more horses died over the next month, the FDA said.\""The firm did not perform adequate cleanout between batches to remove monensin from the equipment before mixing the horse feed,\"" the FDA said.Monensin, and other ionophores are used as a specific feed additive for growth-promoting agents in livestock feed and as coccidiostats in poultry and other birds. The major ionophore drugs in this category are monensin, lasolacid, laidlomycin, narasin and salinomycin, all of which can pose a risk to equines.The ionophores are sold under different brand products, such as Rumensin, by Elanco, and problems can occur when a horse ingests more than 1.4 mg/kg (milligram of medication per kilogram of body weight). In comparison, cattle can be fed over 26 mg/kg, according to Elanco.Veterinarians recommend that horse owners review clinical signs of feed-associated poisonings and be on the lookout. Diagnosing problems early can prevent death.Horses that ingest too much monensin can show clinical signs including poor appetite, diarrhea, weakness, rapid heart rate, labored breathing, exercise intolerance, depression, wobbly gait, colic and sweating. Death can result within three days of ingesting a poisonous amount. According to research, horses that survive can have long-term heart issues.MIXING ERRORSAccording to a Journal of Vet Science study, feed mistakes and mixing errors are the two most common causes of monensin toxicity. In light of the studies and concerns, Farmers/Ranchers Co-op was quick to recall the feed last November.\""We got the majority of the feed back, before it was consumed,\"" Young said, adding that the company has put some extra steps in place to prevent a repeat of last year\'s recall.\""In November 2017, Farmers/Ranchers Co-op issued a voluntary recall of feed labeled for horses. A routine inspection by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture revealed trace amounts of monensin in a horse feed. This was an isolated incident involving 2 tons of feed. Farmers/Ranchers Co-op quickly contacted purchasers of this feed about the potential issue. All unused feed from this lot was recovered and disposed of properly. No animals suffered any adverse health effects due to consuming this feed,\"" Farmers/Ranchers shared in a statement.Since the recall, Farmers/Ranchers Co-op has taken further steps to isolate any possibility of monensin carryover. Frequent feed testing for monensin residue is being done to ensure these procedures are effective.\""We have taken this issue very seriously and have improved protocols to prevent any reoccurrence,\"" Young said. \""Farmers/Ranchers Co-op is an industry leader in safe and quality feed. We will continue to work beyond industry guidelines to manufacture safe and wholesome animal feed for all our customers.\""The FDA reminds people who think their horses or livestock are ill from consuming adulterated food to immediately stop feeding the suspect food to any animals, regardless of whether they show symptoms, and to contact a veterinarian.At press time, Gilman had not responded to The Fence Post\'s request for an interview. ?- Eatherton is a freelance writer from Beulah, Wyo.

The cartoon pig made her Chinese debut in 2015, and has since become a favoured mascot among adults who identify with shehuiren, or slacker culture.<br />Peppa is the latest in a line of seemingly innocuous cartoon characters to have fallen foul of Chinese censors. Here, we take a look at other shows banned in China in recent years.<br />SpongeBob SquarePants<br />One of the world\'s most widely banned cartoons, irreverent Nickelodeon comedy SpongeBob SquarePants was an obvious choice for restriction in China - though perhaps not for the reasons you might imagine. <br />What does China have against Peppa Pig?<br />In 2008, the animated series about a goofy sea sponge and his marine pals was banned on all children\'s channels in the prime time viewing hours between 5pm and 8pm to promote China\'s domestic cartoon industry instead. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television said in a statement that the measures would help \""create a favourable environment for the domestic cartoon industry\"".<br />Scooby Doo<br />Restricted on the same basis as SpongeBob, Scooby Doo was another cartoon squeezed out of the Chinese airwaves in 2008 to promote the domestic animation industry in the \""golden hours\"" evening slot. The ban would \""enhance the [the administration\'s] management over cartoon programmes and create a favourable environment for the domestic cartoon industry\"", the administration said in a statement, according to Xinhua. Other Western cartoons to have fallen under the same restriction include The Flintstones and Bugs Bunny,<br />Chinese president Xi Jinping can\'t bear being compared to Winnie the Pooh any more, so the cartoon cub is now banned in China<br />Death Note<br />China\'s Ministry of Culture is known to crack down on anime and manga it deems too violent. The Death Note animated series, adapted from one of the most successful manga of all time, was singled out as a particularly bad influence due to a string of incidents where schoolchildren inspired by the storyline were found writing their own lists of people they wanted dead. <br />In 2007, China banned a Death Note-inspired notebook children had been using to write their lists, leading to the confiscation of 187 notebooks in the southern city of Shenzhen, according to Anime News Network. <br />Winnie the Pooh<br />Last year, Winnie the Pooh joined the ranks of subversive cartoon characters after the plump, yellow bear was used in memes to mock Chinese president Xi Jinping. <br />As well as showing zero tolerance for anything that ridicules the country\'s leader, censors chose to stamp down on the bear to prevent social media users from taking Pooh bear as a euphemism for the leader in the run-up to last autumn\'s Communist Party Congress, which saw Xi begin his second term in office.<br />Attack on Titan<br />In a move criticised as anti-Japanese by anime fans throughout China, the government issued a blanket ban on 38 Japanese cartoons in 2015, shutting down eight Chinese websites for streaming anime that \""encourage juvenile delinquency, glorify violence and include sexual content\"", according to the Kyodo news agency. <br />As well as popular titles such as Tokyo Ghoul, Devil May Cry, Highschool of the Dead and Death Note, the axe also came down on Attack on Titan, a violent show that carried extra significance after democracy supporters in Hong Kong used imagery from the series during the Occupy protests in 2014.<br />No more gory Elsa, Mickey and Peppa Pig as China cracks down on graphic cartoons for kids<br />Bojack Horseman<br />Chinese censors thwarted one of Netflix\'s best hopes of breaking into the lucrative Chinese entertainment market last year when the critically acclaimed animated series Bojack Horseman disappeared from China\'s iQiyi streaming service. <br />Aimed at an adult market, the dark comedy, which features a drunken, melancholic, celebrity horse, struck a chord with young, disillusioned Chinese, who began sharing memes and quotes from the show. <br />\""Adjustments need to be made to the content,\"" iQiyi told Bloomberg, without elaborating, after pulling Bojack two days after the show\'s launch. Rumours circulated that, like Peppa Pig, the show found wide appeal among the slacker crowd and was seen to promote nihilism.<br />Despicable Me 2<br />It was never clear why Despicable Me\'s beloved yellow minions did not receive an official release in China in 2013. Since 2012, China has permitted a limited number of foreign films to be imported each year. Rumours swirled about possible reasons for the ban, including competition with domestic animators. However, a representative of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television told The Hollywood Reporter that the movie had never been presented for release. <br />In a similar turn, DreamWorks\' The Croods ended its run in Chinese cinemas two weeks early, allegedly because it was bringing in more income than domestic animated films.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH9aTupBVmtbI9QQPqMJosHw9FbPA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779889265710&ei=1AbsWrj8CI2xzAbJk5nYCg&url=http://www.scmp.com/culture/film-tv/article/2144561/after-peppa-pigs-ban-china-here-are-eight-other-cartoons-and,EN,,04/05/2018 07:07,2018-05-04 00:53:22+00:00,c1967ab863,South China Morning Post,,,,,1525402402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43d9dc7295,Stepping up to wheat-based finishing diets in cattle - Canadian Cattlemen,"Stepping up to wheat-based finishing diets in cattle<br />Grain-based diets improve feed efficiency, but increase the risk of rumen acidosis. Rumen acidosis occurs when rumen pH drops below 5.6 for more than three consecutive hours. Severe or chronic acidosis is an animal welfare concern due to rumen damage, liver abscesses, lameness, and an economic cost due to compromised feed conversion and growth performance. Consequently, feedlot operators manage their feed bunks and feeding programs very carefully, particularly as cattle transition from forage-based backgrounding to grain-based finishing diets.<br />The risk of acidosis is influenced by grain type (wheat being a higher risk than corn, with barley being intermediate), the extent of grain processing, feeding frequency and bunk management. Group size and pen density are also factors, so research trials using individually fed animals may produce different results than trials where cattle are fed in larger groups.<br />Brittany Wiese, Greg Penner and co-workers at the University of Saskatchewan recently published the results of a trial partly funded by the Beef Cattle Research Council in which backgrounded cattle were transitioned to a wheat-based finishing diet at a commercial feedlot in southern Alberta (Defining risk for low reticuloruminal pH during the diet transition period in a commercial feedlot in western Canada J. Anim. Sci. 95:420).<br />What they did: A total of 998 crossbred yearling heifers and 907 steers were fed separately in eight pens averaging 249 heifers or 227 steers per pen. In each pen, four cattle were given a bolus to continuously measure and record rumen pH. Cattle were initially fed a backgrounding diet for 66 days (46.5 per cent corn and alfalfa silage, 38 per cent barley grain, 15 per cent DDGS, limestone, and mineral and vitamin premix), then stepped up over 40 days and five transition diets to a finishing diet (9.5 per cent corn silage, 80 per cent wheat grain, 10 per cent DDGS, and mineral and vitamin premix). Cattle were fed three to four times per day, such that bunks were \""slick\"" (completely empty) at the end of the day. On days when the diet changed, the new diet was introduced at the second feeding of the day. Straw bales were added to the pen once when staff felt that cattle were experiencing digestive upsets. The boluses and pH data were recovered when the cattle were slaughtered at the end of the feeding period.<br />What they learned: As expected, increasing the level of wheat grain in the diet had the expected effects on rumen pH. In all cattle, pH dropped, became more variable, and pH spent more time below 5.6 as the cattle moved through the transition diets. On the first transition diet, pH averaged 6.4, cattle averaged 10 minutes per day at a pH below 5.6, and fewer than 10 per cent of cattle experienced between one and three bouts of acidosis (i.e. episodes where they spent 180 consecutive minutes below pH 5.6). On the finishing diet, pH averaged 6.1 and cattle spent an average of 157 minutes per day at a pH below 5.6. Over 40 per cent of cattle experienced one to three bouts of acidosis, and less than 10 per cent experienced seven to ten bouts of acidosis. Some cattle had bouts of acidosis on more than one diet; when added across the whole trial, 57 per cent of cattle had experienced one to three bouts, 20 per cent had experienced four to six bouts, three per cent had experienced seven to 10 bouts, and three per cent had experienced more than 10 bouts of acidosis.<br />What it means: Three things stand out for me. Cattle can be successfully transitioned to a wheat-based finishing diet with pH effects of a relatively mild severity, provided it\'s done carefully and slowly. By comparison, an earlier trial (J. Anim. Sci. 92:3053) adjusted cattle (35 head per pen) from 42 per cent to 81 per cent barley grain using four transition diets over 19 days with similar results; on the final diet, pH averaged 6.0, with cattle spending up to 195 minutes per day at pH below 5.6.<br />Another study where cattle were penned and fed individually as they were transitioned from 35 per cent to 85 per cent barley grain in five steps over 15 days reported an average pH of 5.8 with cattle spending more than nine hours per day at pH below 5.6 (J. Anim. Sci. 83:1116). This confirms that rumen pH measurements collected from individually fed cattle do not represent those experienced by cattle in pen feeding situations.<br />Cattle evidently vary considerably in their ability to cope with high-grain diets. Although 26 per cent of cattle in this study experienced four or more bouts of acidosis during this trial, 57 per cent experienced only one to three bouts, and 17 per cent experienced no acidosis at all. More research would be needed to determine whether these differences stem from their place in the pecking order, genetic differences, differences in the bacteria, protozoa and fungi in their rumen (i.e. the \""rumen microbiome\""), previous nutritional and health history, or some combination of all these things.<br />The Beef Research Cluster is funded by the Canadian Beef Cattle Checkoff and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada with additional contributions from provincial beef industry groups and governments to advance research and technology transfer supporting the Canadian beef industry\'s vision to be recognized as a preferred supplier of healthy, high-quality beef, cattle and genetics.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFu9T0x7Lv1KMo42h6B9xPzypZVTw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=NK3cWISyGYzwWLK_nKgG&url=https://www.canadiancattlemen.ca/2017/03/29/stepping-up-to-wheat-based-finishing-diets/,EN,,30/03/2017 07:01,2017-03-29 16:48:42+00:00,09f6823154,Canadian Cattlemen,,,,,1490813322,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s quite clear, you only have to drive along the road and you can see it, you don\'t need to look beyond the road.<br />But Dr Waipara and other scientists still do not have the data to say how fast kauri dieback is spreading in Northland.<br />The sort of aerial surveys Jack Craw commissioned in the council-owned Wait?kere forests eight years ago, didn\'t start in the north till 2014.<br />The Kauri Dieback national programme run by MPI did an aerial sweep of the region last summer and found 200 new suspected disease locations.<br />The follow-up soil sampling, or ground-truthing needed to confirm the disease also still hasn\'t been done.<br />Dr Amanda Black, from Lincoln University\'s Bio-Protection Research Centre said the programme was a \""trainwreck\"".<br />\""We\'ve had weak governance around the programme, we\'ve had people involved in managing the programme not knowing how to procure research, not knowing what to look for, and not knowing how to manage it. And we\'ve had some non-delivery in key science areas that has led to the further demise of trees in this forest.\""<br />She said Waipoua was in urgent need of a crisis management plan if the big trees were to be saved.<br />Dr Black said the forest may be a big tourism earner, but few people will show up to see dead trees.<br />A biosecurity specialist overseeing a review of kauri dieback management said it would be unfair to blame MPI for failing to control the spread to date, but acknowledged there were serious gaps in what authorities knew about the disease.<br />Barry O\'Neill is heading the independent panel set up to investigate how kauri dieback has been handled and advise on improvements.<br />Speaking in Whangarei last night, Mr O\'Neill said there was a need to act fast to save the remaining healthy trees.<br />\""I am concerned that we do not have an accurate understanding of where it is, how bad it is, whether it\'s progressing rapidly, and if there are trees that haven\'t been affected.<br />\""So some of this basic knowledge we don\'t have and we absolutely do need,\"" he said.<br />Mr O\'Neil said it was clear from the first public consultation hui in Northland this week that people were passionate about kauri and wanted to know what they could do to save the trees.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFDGOEiR1SVJsd5mQC26GJd-H36aA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779945081007&ei=AUQ7W9rQIYqEmwX51KugAg&url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/kauri-dieback-in-waipoua-forest-tragedy-scientist,EN,,03/07/2018 09:36,2018-07-03 00:57:04+00:00,c1967ab863,TVNZ,,,,,1530586624,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4409d5ec0f,"As cruel industrial pig farming persists in the EU, one million citizens demand change - EURACTIV","As cruel industrial pig farming persists in the EU, one million citizens demand change - EURACTIV.com<br />Under the European Commission\'s indulgent eye, the race to the bottom in the EU\'s pig industry pushes profits to the edge at the cost of pig welfare, against law and public opinion. But a movement of citizens and NGOs is gaining momentum to demand change in the industry\'s methods.<br />This op-ed is co-signed by Reineke Hameleers, director at Eurogroup for Animals, and several MEPs, members of the pig welfare working group in the Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, namely Jeppe Kofod (S&D, Chair), Fredrick Federley(ALDE, Vice-Chair), Jytte Guteland(S&D), Anja Hazekamp(GUE/NGL) and Keith Taylor (Greens/EFA).<br />With the pan-European campaign \'EndPigPain\', Eurogroup for Animals and its 64 member organisations exposed the squalid living conditions and illegal handling practices faced by pigs throughout Europe.<br />\'EndPigPain\', endorsed by more than a million citizens, calls on national Agricultural Ministers and the European Commission to stop all pig mutilations while ensuring enforcement of the EU Pigs Directive.<br />Painful husbandry procedures such as castration and tail docking - while inherent in today\'s pig farming - are completely unnecessary. Technically and economically feasible alternatives to eventually lead to pain-free pig farming already exist and must now be mainstreamed.<br />Thus, European citizens demand change. At the very least, change will have to start with enforcement of current European legislation on pig welfare. We are faced with the unprecedented situation whereby, with the exceptions of Finland and Sweden, EU member states are disregarding minimum legal standards for the protection of pigs.<br />According to recent audits carried out by the European Commission, in several major pig producing member states, this roughly translates in over 90% of pigs routinely mutilated (tail docked).<br />This happens because their living conditions are so squalid and barren that intact curly tails - which pigs wag or \""swish\"" just like dogs - become the only available stimulus, and are therefore chewed on by other pigs. Hence, tails are cut off to prevent problems.<br />Farmers should provide pigs with alternative stimuli, namely appropriate substrates that pigs can explore with their snouts, as in nature these animals spend most of their active time rooting in the soil.<br />But providing straw or other chewable materials to keep pigs occupied has proven more difficult than the legislator thought, and therefore pigs are given metal chains, wooden blocks, or other \""toys\"" to entertain themselves. Which clearly neither work nor satisfy EU legal requirements.<br />So far the approach of the European Commission with regards to the widespread lack of enforcement of the Pig Directive has been soft, consisting of a tri-annual action plan. We think it\'s high time for infringement proceedings, and the success of End Pig Pain adds weight to our requests. This crisis is not only about the basic welfare of animals but also about the credibility of EU law.<br />The European Union rears about 250 million pigs, predominantly in intensive conditions. Breeding sows spend almost half of their productive lives in individual confinement, namely during part of gestation, farrowing and lactation, and this for each reproductive cycle, non-stop.<br />They now produce so many piglets per litter that piglet mortality has reached unprecedented and ethically disputable levels (with up to 35% of piglets dying before weaning). Sow mortality is also increasing due to excessive selection for high productivity.<br />Surviving piglets are routinely mutilated: apart from tail docking, in most EU countries male piglets are still castrated without or with inadequate pain relief. They are then prematurely separated from their mothers so that they suffer from stress and digestive problems that compromise their health and welfare, and require the use of antibiotics.<br />Fattening pigs live in sheds among noxious gases, with no access to enrichments, soft bedding, or outdoor access, until ready for slaughter.<br />One common argument is that this industrialised production model is the one that can guarantee animal health, food security, cheap food for consumers and competitive exports on a global market.<br />However, the ongoing African Swine Fever outbreaks show that this whole industrial pig farming system is very vulnerable, especially if even basic biosecurity measures are not respected, as it incredibly appears to be the case in Europe.<br />High concentrations of farms rearing hundreds or thousands of pigs in close proximity, as is the case in some areas of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, are like bombs ready to explode when diseases such as this one, appear on the horizon.<br />The economic consequences are already hitting hard, as EU export markets suspend imports of pig meat from affected regions. But the highest price will once again be paid by the animals, who are already being killed by the thousands to prevent the spread of the disease, and by wild boars, loudly (and unduly) accused of being the sole responsible for spreading the disease.<br />All this warrants a fundamental and serious reflection on whether this is the direction in which we want to go for the future. Is this really our way of acknowledging animal sentience? As our scientific knowledge progresses, ethical standards about the way in which we rear animals for food will continue to evolve.<br />It is urgent that politicians, decision makers, and farmers heed the demands of civil society, adapting policies to updated scientific evidence and considering the economic opportunities that a reassessment and advancement in our treatment of farmed animals can offer.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFkm07nJ01j1TbS1UrSre4OkqFvbg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=zLy1W8iIH9H96QS7ta3wDA&url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/opinion/as-cruel-industrial-pig-farming-persists-in-the-eu-one-million-citizens-demand-change/,EN,,04/10/2018 07:09,2018-10-04 02:33:39+00:00,a83cc6376b,EURACTIV,,,,,1538627619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44106897f7,Rare Utah tornado still has Weber County families bouncing back - Standard-Examiner,"Rare Utah tornado still has Weber County families bouncing back<br />It\'s been two months since a rare tornado tore across parts of Weber County. Since then, those affected have been putting their lives back together.<br />Peggy and Bob Dunn, of South Ogden, say they\'ll never forget Sept. 22, 2016.<br />\""It shocked us,\"" Peggy Dunn said. \""We were here standing in the kitchen and heard a huge explosion. We couldn\'t figure out what had happened. There\'s a substation behind us, and we thought maybe it was that.\""<br />It wasn\'t the substation.<br />A tornado had twisted out of the ground one of the huge mountain ash trees in their yard, throwing it against the side of the house and tearing off the overhang on the south side of the home. The damage allowed rainwater to cascade down the wall in a main-floor bedroom.<br />RELATED: Tornado touches down in Washington Terrace, surrounding areas[1]<br />\""It rained all night,\"" Peggy Dunn said. \""It soaked the bedroom floor, and then went into the basement bedroom and bathroom and soaked them.\""<br />The Dunns say that, two months later, the repairs to their home are almost complete. The interior is back to normal, although there are some exterior repairs that remain.<br />\""We\'ve lived here since 1965, and never had any kind of issue,\"" Peggy Dunn said. \""We\'re almost 80, and now we have a tornado?\""<br />What\'s most peculiar to the Dunns is how random the damage was. While the mountain ash and a small flowering plum tree near the patio were ripped from the ground, their vinyl fence was completely unscathed.<br />\""And none of the patio furniture was even knocked over,\"" Peggy Dunn said.<br />In Washington Terrace, where much of the damage was reported, city manager Tom Hanson says that, two months later, they still have six families who haven\'t been able to return to their homes.<br />\""These are homes that had more than just power challenges or simple repairs,\"" Hanson said. \""Some had trusses shifted, or various other levels of repair. Also, because of all the glass shrapnel, some have had to get their carpet replaced. There\'s more damage than meets the eye.\""<br />Hanson said insurance companies have been working with the families.<br />\""We\'ve got one home that will have to be demolished,\"" he said. \""It was totaled.\""<br />That family is waiting for their insurance to approve the demolition of the house, according to Hanson.<br />The tornado initially came up the bluff near Little Rohmer Park, hit a house in Riverdale and some houses on 500 West before lifting and touching down a little farther to the east, according to Hanson.<br />\""Then it really drilled in at 4700 South and 250 East - where the house is going to be removed - and then skipped up again,\"" he said.<br />Attempts to contact Riverdale officials for a tornado update were unsuccessful.<br />Hanson believes his community is stronger for having been through the ordeal.<br />\""I used to have a guy tell me, \'You know, what this community needs is a nice disaster to bring us together and work as a team,\'\"" Hanson said. \""And when this happened, it didn\'t dawn on me at first. But then I realized the truth of what he was saying - not that I\'d wish this on anyone, but we really came together to help one another through this.\""<br />Hanson said he gives the residents of his city an \""A\"" grade for the way in which they responded to the emergency.<br />\""Sure, looking back there are some small things we can improve on,\"" he said. \""Honestly, we\'ve said that the tornado was the perfect-sized event for our city to have a really meaningful (emergency preparedness) exercise. Do we want citizens to suffer so we can practice? Absolutely not. But this event was of great value to help us be prepared in the future.\""<br />RECOVERING HISTORY<br />Also affected by the Sept. 22 tornado was the Fielding Garr Ranch, an 1800s-era collection of buildings at Antelope Island State Park[2]. Jeremy Shaw, park manager, says the ranch\'s sheep-shearing barn took the brunt of the damage.<br />\""The old historical houses fared well,\"" Shaw said. <br />Shaw says nobody on the island saw the tornado, as they all took shelter, but all signs point to a tornado strike.<br />\""The barn walls had been pushed out, consistent with the negative pressure of a tornado,\"" Shaw said. \""And the roof of the barn looked like somebody took a can opener and peeled it from the inside out.\""<br />Shaw says they had a company come out and remove debris to make it safe for visitors. Within a week, the ranch was reopened.<br />Replacing that barn roof to make it both safe and historically accurate will be a bit of a longer process, according to Shaw. The ranch is on the National Register of Historic Places, so they can\'t just slap a bunch of plywood atop the barn.<br />\""It will take us a while to orchestrate a fix that will satisfy the State of Utah and the contractor - to allow the barn to remain historically significant, but also be structurally sound,\"" he said. \""We need to replicate the original barn as best we can. ...We\'re finding a way to rebuild it to current specs, without looking like it\'s to current specs. And that\'s what\'s taking so long.\""<br />Shaw is hopeful that, given the mild winters on the island, they\'ll be able to begin repairs within the next 30 to 60 days, with a finish date of sometime in April.<br />Contact Mark Saal at 801-625-4272, or msaal@standard.net.

44293fc289,Zinke must uphold Gold Butte\'s new protected status - Las Vegas Sun,"Zinke must uphold Gold Butte\'s new protected status<br />Sunday, Jan. 22, 2017 | 2 a.m. By revealing that he will consider tearing up the order declaring Gold Butte a national monument, Ryan Zinke has officially become a cause for alarm in Nevada. Zinke, President Donald Trump\'s nominee for secretary of the Interior, told senators at a confirmation hearing Tuesday that he planned to review former President Barack Obama\'s declaration order. However, Zinke said he would visit Nevada before making a decision on the 300,000-acre area. Zinke, a U.S. House member from Wyoming, is more than welcome to visit. But there\'s only one acceptable outcome to his decision-making, and that\'s to keep the order firmly in place. For proof, Zinke should start by talking to William Anderson, former chairman of the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians. After the announcement that Obama had signed his order, a grateful Anderson gave an impassioned speech outlining why the area was an environmental and cultural treasure that deserved protection. He described the land\'s importance to the tribe, which has been living on it for centuries, and the pain that tribe members felt in recent years after seeing ancient petroglyphs in the area desecrated by vandals and the ecology damaged by campers and riders of off-road vehicles. \""Part of my culture, part of my heritage was being taken away,\"" Anderson said. Gold Butte must be preserved, and Obama\'s order was only a first step. Now, not only does Zinke need to leave the order in place, he needs to support funding to keep it clean and secure. Zinke has said he would not sell, give away or transfer public lands, but he\'s also said he\'d consider changing the way the federal government manages public lands and, just this month, voted in favor of a House rules package that makes it easier to give federal lands to states. That\'s worrisome, as it could open the door to coal mining, oil and gas drilling or other environmentally destructive activity on public lands. In the case of Gold Butte, such development makes no sense. In terms of generating energy, its biggest potential would be solar power, and there\'s more than enough space elsewhere in Nevada to plant solar arrays in areas that aren\'t environmentally or culturally sensitive. Another detrimental effect of overturning the designation order is that it would no doubt be seen as a victory by rancher Cliven Bundy and those who support his extremists causes. Bundy has grazed cattle on Gold Butte for decades without paying fees, claiming the government has no right to the acreage. His dispute with the government came to a head in 2014 during what became known as the Battle of Bunkerville, an armed standoff between government agents who were rounding up the cattle and a group of Bundy supporters that included militia members. Granted, the method behind the declaration wasn\'t ideal - it would have been wonderful if Nevada congressional delegates would have succeeded in pushing through a legislative solution. But Obama\'s order was acceptable and appropriate. Assuming Zinke makes his visit here, that\'s the message he should hear loud and clear from state leaders.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGtg-icya9dEsCeBrVg6drVq4UxeA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=Kq6FWPj-HMG0W66IlrgE&url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/jan/22/zinke-must-uphold-gold-buttes-new-protected-status/,EN,,23/01/2017 08:03,2017-01-22 09:05:04+00:00,51fe179e08,Las Vegas Sun,,,,,1485079504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tendon slashing and eye stabbing is sometimes used to make animals more pliant before processing in poor nations, and the practice has been of concern to animal welfare professionals and activists for many decades. In Brazil, pre-slaughter stunning is required by law.The Brazilian government rapidly appealed the case, having the ban overturned on Tuesday[4]. The superior court found that export practices met national laws. (The previous ruling had suspended all exports until they were aligned with Brazilian standards.)Unlike in Australia, records of animal deaths in transit (approximately 30 days by sea to the Middle-East from South America), are not routinely kept, irrespective that transportation is known to place considerable stress on animals, and that poor transportation practices can lead to deaths from heat stress and communicable disease.While Brazil is not currently a significant competitor with Australia, the case is of interest to our beef producers and exporters for a number of reasons.A tale of two bans The first is because of broad parallels with the temporary suspension[5] of Australian live exports in 2011. This suspension, lasting five weeks, followed a dramatic Four Corners program that aired footage collected by Australian activists of Indonesian slaughter practices. The quantity and intensity of public reaction to the footage surprised many in the Gillard government, and Labor came very close to an outright prohibition on exporting animals for slaughter as New Zealand had done in 2003, before pulling back in favour of increased regulation in the form of the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS).<br />Photo:<br />People gather during a national rally to support an end to Australia\'s live animal export trade in Sydney. (AAP: Animals Australia, Nikki To)<br />[6]What is different in the Brazilian case was the effectiveness of this particular litigation strategy. In Australia, activists have often relied on mobilising public opinion over using the law, finding legal strategies costly and difficult to win. At times, Australian activists have sued governments for failing to act on their responsibilities to enforce animal welfare, accusing government regulators of being \""captured\"" by industry and unwilling to fulfil their full legal responsibilities when welfare and commerce clash.<br />Photo:<br />Australian cows are loaded onto a truck in Jakarta. (Supri: Reuters)<br />[7]Animal welfare laws in Australia follow a model laid down in Britain over 180 years ago: a focus on limited protections, with broad exemptions to ensure commercial production is privileged. In some parts of Australia, species we now know to have complex mental states are excluded from statutory definitions of what an \""animal\"" is for legal purposes; making fish, reptiles, and cephalopods not-animals in some parts of Australia and therefore effectively beyond anti-cruelty laws.Brazil is a different and interesting case. Laws from the early 20th century gave animal protection lawyers a standing in court, removing the first hurdle of litigation. Further, the 1988 Brazilian Constitution requires the government protect flora and fauna, prevent species extinction, and prohibit animal cruelty. This makes the issue solely the responsibility of the national government.In Australian federalism, responsibilities are divided between the Commonwealth and States, with responsibility shifting when animals are put on ships for export. This situation prompted the West Australian Agriculture Minister, Alannah MacTiernan, to last year accuse the Commonwealth of \""shirking its responsibilities\"" after the death of 3,000 sheep bound for the Middle East in 2016.This followed on from the abolition of the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy Advisory Committee by the incoming Abbott government in 2013, a move that gave credence to the argument that the Commonwealth lacked commitment to developing high-quality, harmonised welfare standards for animals across Australia.<br />Photo:<br />In 2011, Indonesia accounted for about 80 per cent of Australia\'s live cattle exports. (ABC News: Samantha Hawley)<br />[8]But similarities remain. Brazilian law is ambiguous about animals used for commercial purposes, mirroring the paradox we have in Australia that the same species of animal can be subject to completely different regulatory regimes if it is deemed wild, a pet, or a farmed animal.Government sides with agriculture Further, both nations are responsive to the concerns of agricultural interests.Brazil\'s Minister for Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply, Blairo Maggi declared the recent legal reversal a victory for farming in his country. Last year the constitutional anti-cruelty provision was amended to legalise some cruel practices if they form part of the \""intangible cultural heritage\"" of Brazilians. Mr Maggi himself has a personal background in farming, and particularly soybean production. While soy might encourage thoughts of vegan-friendly tofu and soy milk, Brazilian beans are primarily produced for export as animal feedstock, making the Minister part of the massive global animal agricultural supply chain of which live export is but a small part. In Australia, industry is calling for winding-back of ESCAS regulations and calling for more \""regulatory parity\"" with competitor nations. This might mean a return to the days of unregulated animal slaughter for exported cattle.Activists\' global reachAnother reason for Australian interest in the Brazilian case is the role Animals Australia may have played in it.The group that brought the specific case leading to the temporary ban is the Forum Nacional de Protecao e Defesa Animal. The Forum is the peak body of animal protection organisations in Brazil, representing over 130 organisations. However, in the lead up to this case, Animals Australia was active, through its international arm Animals International, in highlighting misconduct in the Brazilian live export industry and promoting legal changes: an ESCAS-type model if not a complete ban.This follows the organisation\'s expertise in conducting in-country investigations, capturing footage of mistreatment, and producing high-quality and media-friendly campaigns targeting producers.Just as animal agriculture is now a global network of supply and production, where soybeans grown in Brazil can feed US cattle that are exported to China for reprocessing for further export, animal activism has become an interlocked global practice. <br />Photo:<br />Lyn White (red) of Animals Australia speaks during a rally to support an end to Australia\'s live animal export trade. (User submitted: Stephen Shaw)<br />[9]Over the last few decades many countries have seen a proliferation of animal protectionist organisations, leading to some very large and increasingly well-resourced campaigning organisations. These in-turn have partnered with international collaborators to provide information, resources, and expertise.Thus, the Brazilian case represents only a small skirmish in an ongoing global conflict between international activism and global capital.Dr Peter Chen is a senior lecturer in media and politics at the University of Sydney\'s Department of Government and International Relations and the author of Animal Welfare in Australia, Politics and Policy[10].<br />Topics:<br />beef-cattle[11],<br />livestock[12],<br />livestock-welfare[13],<br />brazil[14],<br />australia[15]<br />First posted <br />February 07, 2018 14:55:57<br />References^ Photo: In Brazil, animal activists sought an injunction into the live export of cattle.

446e384812,New Report on Global Resistance Threat Underscores Flawed US Approach - Natural Resources Defense Council,"New Report on Global Resistance Threat Underscores Flawed U.S. Approach<br />Global economic growth is anemic. And there\'s another huge hit on the horizon. Ten million deaths per year, and lost production amounting to $100 trillion annually[1]. That\'s the predicted global toll by 2050 from the epidemic of antibiotic resistant infections-unless we get our hands around it.<br />The predictions are from Lord Jim O\'Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist commissioned 2 years ago by the UK Prime Minister to complete a comprehensive review on antibiotic resistance. Resistance, O\'Neill argues strongly, needs to be seen as the threat that it is to economic growth, as well as to national security.<br />His final report (of ten, overall) was just published yesterday. Tackling Drug-Resistant Infections Globally: Final Report and Recommendations offers up a ten-point plan, but zeroes in on just four, especially important interventions. [2]<br />First, says O\'Neill, we need a \""massive\"", global public awareness campaign. Second, we have to somehow overcome the lack of a pipeline for new antibiotics. Third, we have to get smarter and only use antibiotics when absolutely necessary-because it\'s our tremendous overuse that speeds up drug resistance. Fourth, and the focus of this blog, we must reduce the extensive and unnecessary antibiotics in agriculture. Let\'s reflect on how well the U.S. is implementing this key final goal.<br />Over 70% of antibiotics of human importance in the U.S. are sold for use in animals, not people; typically those drugs are given to animals that are healthy or without any diagnosis of disease. O\'Neill outlines three steps that could bring about much needed progress: [3]<br />Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, 2016 <br />#1 Set targets.<br />There\'s a strong case for individual countries to set hard 10-year targets to shrink antibiotic use in agriculture, starting in 2018.<br />How does the U.S. rate? Just over a year ago, the White House released its National Action Plan (NAP) to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria to great fanfare. Among other strengths, the Plan committed by 2020 to reducing inappropriate medical use of antibiotics by 20% in U.S. hospitals and by 50%[4] in clinics and community settings. Fourteen months later, as I recently blogged[5], no such targets have been set for reducing sales of human antibiotics for use in livestock or poultry, where the large majority are apparently being used.<br />In fact, the President\'s Plan relies on the FDA to restrict antibiotics used in agriculture, and that agency is entirely focused on ending antibiotics in animal feed for growth promotion. Industry itself has estimated such products account for no more than 10-15% of all antibiotics[6] used in agriculture. The O\'Neill report (p. 26) calls out that a \""ban on the use of antibiotics for growth promotion for example, while a significant step forward, alone would not solve the problem.\""<br />In fact, the FDA has deliberately created a gaping loophole such that many antibiotics losing a claim for \""growth promotion\"" on their label can continue to be used at equivalent dosages in the name of routine \""disease prevention\"".  When a decade ago regulators in the Netherlands tried a similar approach to reducing antibiotic use, it failed. Veterinary drug sales later were reduced by half, but only after the Dutch government launched a much more aggressive effort to reduce use of ALL antibiotics in feed?, including for disease prevention. [7][8][9][10]<br />#2 Ensure special protections for highly critical human antibiotics.<br />Too many antibiotics of last resort for sick people, like fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, are also being used in agriculture. Immediate action is needed to better protect them by restricting or banning certain such uses outright.<br />How does the U.S. rate? In the U.S., gentamicin still is injected into many of the eggs that hatch into chicks. Some off label use of cephalosporins has been restricted in chickens, but overall use of cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and macrolides remains widespread in livestock. Sales of cephalosporins and macrolides for use in food animals rose 57% and 11%, respectively, from 2009 to 2014, according to FDA data (Table 9)[11].<br />#3 Expect transparency.<br />For consumers to make more informed decisions, the report insists, food producers must be transparent on the antibiotics used to raise the meat that we eat.<br />How does the U.S. rate?  The FDA has never required farms or veterinarians to report on the amount of antibiotics used at the farm level, or for what purpose. Each year FDA does publicly release figures on sales of antibiotics to be used in food animals, but those are not equivalent to actual usage data. Moreover, the sales data are not parsed out according to usage in particular animal species (chickens, pigs, cows, etc.), or for a particular purpose, like growth promotion.<br />For its part, the Senate this week appropriated only $5 million[12] to the USDA\'s APHIS program to collect on-farm data on antibiotic use, just half of what the President\'s budget had requested, which itself had appeared to us to be inadequate to the task. To meet public demand for more information, meat companies and restaurants have begun making claims about how their products are produced, but these claims are mostly not verified by an independent third party.<br />With the May 19th release of his final report, Lord O\'Neil arguably has succeeded in his stated goal of putting antibiotic resistance at the \""forefront of the minds of heads of state, finance ministers, agriculture ministers and of course health ministers, for years to come.\"" Will that translate into meaningful progress in terms of U.S. policy change to restrict antibiotics widely used in U.S. cows, chickens and pigs? Maybe, but prospects for now look grim.<br />And yet, the lack of meaningful restrictions in the U.S. has global significance. The U.S. is the world\'s largest producer of beef[13], turkey[14] and broiler chickens[15], and the third largest hog[16] producer. Without full U.S. participation, in other words, any global efforts to tackle antibiotic resistance will be diminished. Drug resistant microbes travel freely, without respect for borders; when bred in the U.S., these superbugs will find a way to other countries.<br />References^ $100 trillion annually (amr-review.org)^ Tackling Drug-Resistant Infections Globally: Final Report and Recommendations (amr-review.org)^ Over 70% of antibiotics of human importance (switchboard.nrdc.org)^ by 20% in U.S. hospitals and by 50% (www.whitehouse.gov)^ I recently blogged (medium.com)^ 10-15% of all antibiotics (www.forbes.com)^ gaping loophole (www.nrdc.org)^ it failed (emerald.tufts.edu)^ launched (modernfarmer.com)^ much more aggressive effort (modernfarmer.com)^ FDA data (Table 9) (www.fda.gov)^ appropriated only $5 million (news.google.com)^ largest producer of beef (beef2live.com)^ turkey (www.agmrc.org)^ broiler chickens (www.indexmundi.com)^ third largest hog (www.pork.org)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFtqve21_mQaXdsFabGNitv55lX6w&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779111335135&ei=CQlAV9CJAsavzAbatrGoAw&url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/david-wallinga-md/new-report-global-resistance-threat-underscores-flawed-us-approach,EN,,21/05/2016 07:11,2016-05-20 22:56:47+00:00,c9593f6e51,Natural Resources Defense Council,,,,,1463792207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4476244078,The Most Vulnerable Trump Clone in Congress - Mother Jones,"The Most Vulnerable Trump Clone in Congress - Mother Jones<br />Mother Jones illustration; Getty<br />Looking for news you can trust?Subscribe to our free newsletters.<br />If a blue wave floods Capitol Hill in November, dozens of Republican lawmakers could lose their seats, potentially handing control of one or both houses of Congress to Democrats. Many of the Republicans sent packing would likely hail from the more moderate wing of the party-swing district representatives who, on occasion, have attempted to stand up to President Donald Trump. Some of the Republicans most willing to-at least rhetorically-distance themselves from the president have already abandoned ship, opting not to run for reelection. Others have been cast overboard by GOP primary challengers who are more loyal to Trump.<br />But what about Trump\'s biggest supporters in Washington? On issues ranging from Obamacare to immigration to Russia, right-wing lawmakers have lashed their political fortunes to the unpopular president. Here\'s a look at 13 of the \""Trumpiest\"" House members and how likely they are to be swept away in November-in (rough) order from least vulnerable to most endangered.<br />Who is he? The leader of the rabble-rousing, ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus and the man behind a whole range of House controversies, from the federal government shutdown in 2013 to Rep. John Boehner\'s (R-Ohio) decision to resign from the speakership. More recently, Meadows has become one of Trump\'s favorite attack dogs on the Hill because of his rabid defense of the president\'s agenda and spirited critiques of special counsel Robert Mueller\'s Russia investigation. Meadows\' most recent stunt? Filing articles of impeachment in an attempt to oust Rod Rosenstein, who in his role as deputy attorney general made the decision last year to appoint Mueller as special counsel and now oversees the investigation. Only 11 Republicans signed on to the attempt, and a move to force a Housewide vote on the matter was shelved.<br />Trumpiest moments: During a 2016 Trump rally, Meadows fired up the crowd with the infamous \""Lock her up\"" chant. Like Trump, Meadows has trafficked in conspiracy theories about former President Barack Obama\'s place of birth. A few months before the 2012 election, he said, \""We\'re going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is.\"" But his defining act of loyalty to Trump came after the Washington Post released a tape of the then-Republican presidential nominee bragging about groping women. Not only did Meadows stick by Trump at a time when many Republicans called for him to drop out, but his wife-along with the wife of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio)-boarded a \""women for Trump\"" bus to tour the South \""to rally support for him,\"" according to Politico.<br />Will he be reelected? The Cook Political Report predicts a breezy reelection for Meadows in North Carolina\'s deep-red 11th District, where he will face Democrat Phillip Price.<br />Who is he? A freshman congressman from the Florida panhandle. He is one of Trump\'s most passionate boosters, often appearing on Fox News to defend the president. Politico once called him Trump\'s \""best buddy in Congress,\"" and GQ dubbed him \""the Trumpiest congressman in Trump\'s Washington.\""<br />Trumpiest moment: He invited Chuck Johnson-yes, that Chuck Johnson-to be his guest at Trump\'s State of the Union address. Johnson is a notorious online troll who has been banned from Twitter. Johnson once disputed the historical fact that 6 million Jewish people died in the Holocaust, instead suggesting that 250,000 died \""from typhus\"" in concentration camps. Confronted about Johnson\'s statements, Gaetz did not denounce him, telling Fox Business that Johnson was \""not a Holocaust denier.\"" (For his part, Johnson responded to the controversy by apologizing for his past writings and stating that he does in fact believe that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.) On more substantive issues, Gaetz has introduced a bill that would abolish the Environmental Protection Agency and, like many of his conservative colleagues, has called for Mueller to resign. Trump has returned the love: In December, he held a rally in Gaetz\'s district.<br />Will he be reelected? Once Gaetz makes it past a three-way primary August 28, he should be in good shape to secure a second term in one of the most conservative districts in Florida. At least one enthusiastic backer has already voiced his support:<br />Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of the finest and most talented people in Congress. Strong on Crime, the Border, Illegal Immigration, the 2nd Amendment, our great Military & Vets, Matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our Massive Tax Cuts. He has my Full Endorsement!<br />- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2018<br />Is he the one who said...? Whatever you are wondering, the answer is almost certainly \""yes.\"" The three-term congressman from northwest Iowa has made all sorts of controversial public statements. Among his most notable: saying the US government should spy on mosques; describing children who would be granted legal status under the DREAM Act as having \""calves the size of cantaloupes\"" because of all the marijuana they are supposedly smuggling across the border; describing illegal immigration as a \""slow-motion Holocaust\""; and, last March, saying on CNN that he\'d \""like to see an America that\'s just so homogenous that we look a lot the same, from that perspective.\""<br />Trumpiest quality: Like the commander-in-chief, King has a habit of retweeting some unsavory accounts. A post in which he praised the views of far-right Dutch political figure Geert Wilders drew strong outrage from the left and even some (mild) condemnation from King\'s GOP peers. In the tweet, which is still online, King wrote, \""Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can\'t restore our civilization with somebody else\'s babies.\"" In June, King retweeted a self-proclaimed Nazi sympathizer\'s post about a Breitbart poll that detailed Italian opposition to accepting migrants and added, \""Europe is waking up...Will America...in time?\"" The congressman refused to delete the tweet and later said he doesn\'t \""feel guilty one bit\"" about keeping the tweet up.<br />Will he be reelected? Probably. Former baseball player J.D. Scholten could give King the closest reelection race he has had since an 8-point victory in 2012. Iowa\'s 4th Congressional District is not easy terrain for a Democrat to conquer, but Scholten has swung for the fences, so to speak, outraising King by more than $200,000 as of June.<br />Who is he? A reliably right-wing congressman from East Texas who has opined on all sorts of conservative flashpoint issues, from the legitimacy of Mueller\'s investigation to global warming-the latter of which Gohmert has alternately denied is actually happening and praised as good for the planet because it leads to \""more plants.\""<br />Greatest hits: Gohmert once claimed that terrorists would send young women to the United States to have babies born as US citizens who could then freely come back to terrorize Americans after years of being radicalized overseas. He has said gender confirmation surgery, which three-fourths of transgender respondents in one survey said \""significantly\"" improved their quality of life, would cause more US veterans to commit suicide. Gohmert has also suggested that the existence of trans soldiers indicates \""we we are headed into a new period of the Dark Ages\"" and speculated that the Justice Department might be \""spying\"" on him. Gohmert has long had Trump\'s back following even the most controversial of the president\'s statements. Remember when Trump characterized Haiti, El Salvador, and all of Africa as \""shithole\"" countries? \""I\'m not going to defend his language, but I will defend his frustration,\"" Gohmert said soon after on Fox News.<br />Trumpiest moments: As you may have expected, Gohmert is a huge fan of Trump\'s.<br />GOD BLESS DONALD TRUMP! https://t.co/7pGYtGAgEM<br />- Louie Gohmert (@replouiegohmert) June 7, 2018<br />Like Meadows and Gaetz, Gohmert has not hesitated to fight Trump\'s battles on Capitol Hill. Last month, he tussled with top Trump target Peter Strzok in an explosive exchange during a hearing that enraged Republicans and Democrats alike. Strzok, the former FBI agent dubbed \""lover boy\"" by Trump for his extramarital relationship with former FBI attorney Lisa Page, was bounced from Mueller\'s team after a Justice Department internal probe uncovered text messages between Strzok and Page that mocked Trump during the presidential campaign. Referencing Strzok\'s affair directly, Gohmert said: \""I can\'t help but wonder, when I see you looking there with a little smirk, how many times did you look so innocent into your wife\'s eye and lie to her about Lisa Page?\""<br />Will he be reelected? The congressman will have to make it past former US Army nurse Shirley McKellar in November to secure an eighth term. Unseating Gohmert in one of the most conservative districts in the country will be no easy task-the Cook Political Report rates the race as \""solid Republican.\"" But if McKellar\'s enthusiasm on Twitter is any indication, she is ready to give it a shot.<br />RETWEET if you want my opponent Louie Gohmert @replouiegohmert and I to Debate. I will let him choose the place. We will talk about issues and concerns of East Texas. RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET<br />- Shirley McKellar (@Vote4McKellar) July 19, 2018<br />Who is he? A dentist who rode the Tea Party wave to Congress in 2010 and has represented a rural area of Arizona for the past eight years.<br />Random factoid: Gosar is not just a dentist, he\'s a member of the Arizona Dental Association\'s Hall of Fame. And, as a former dentist, he can \""read body language very, very well\""-to the point where he could apparently divine Strzok\'s level of bias during that recent hearing.<br />Greatest hits: Gosar has argued that the Charlottesville white supremacist rally was a false flag operation engineered by Democrats, called for attorneys who provide legal advice to undocumented immigrants to be prosecuted, and described Native Americans as \""wards of the federal government.\""<br />Trumpiest moment: He was the only member of Congress to boycott Pope Francis\' 2015 visit to Capitol Hill because, he said, the pontiff acts like a \""leftist politician.\"" Trump famously also got into a tiff with the leader of the Catholic Church during the presidential campaign after Francis suggested that someone who builds walls \""is not Christian.\"" Trump suggested in response that Mexican officials were responsible for the pope\'s statement and called him a \""very political person.\"" <br />Will he be reelected? Two Democratic candidates have thrown their hats into the ring in an attempt to oust Gosar: David Brill and Delina DiSanto. (A third, Ana Maria Perez, is competing as a write-in candidate.) The challenger who escapes Arizona\'s August 28 primary will have an uphill battle against Gosar in a reliably red district that Trump won by 40 points.<br />Who is he? A family doctor and four-term lawmaker whom Politico once dubbed \""the biggest hypocrite in Congress.\""<br />Trumpiest quality: DesJarlais channels Trump in one key area: his utter shamelessness. He brags about his pro-life voting record and backed a late-term abortion ban despite allegedly advising his ex-wife to have two abortions and pressuring a patient he had been having an affair with to get one, too. The same person who described himself as a \""consistent supporter of pro-life values\"" also broke American Medical Association guidelines by sleeping with several patients, earning DesJarlais a fine from the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners. \""God has forgiven me,\"" he said. The bulk of this information became public in 2012 after a Tennessee court unsealed documents from an ethics complaint filed against DesJarlais. Like Trump, who barely missed a step when several women accused him of sexual misconduct during the presidential campaign, DesJarlais won reelection in 2012, 2014, and 2016.<br />Will he be reelected? DesJarlais has survived close races before. In 2014, four years after his first election to Congress, he squeaked past a GOP primary challenger by just 38 votes. He survived another primary challenge last week, so his fifth general election in the red 4th District shouldn\'t be too difficult.<br />Who is he? Co-founder of the Freedom Caucus and one of the most vocal members of the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees.<br />Claim to fame: He was dubbed a \""legislative terrorist\"" by Boehner, whom Jordan famously tried to oust from his role as speaker of the House. More recently, several Ohio State wrestlers Jordan coached decades ago accused him of ignoring sexual abuse allegedly perpetrated by a team doctor. The ensuing bad press-Trevor Noah called him a \""scumbag\"" and \""Joe Paterno, part two\""-has not stopped Jordan from mounting his own bid for the speakership. He\'s already earned the backing of some of the country\'s most prominent Trump loyalists, including Fox News host Sean Hannity and Gaetz. Jordan has said the \""timing\"" of the Ohio State scandal is \""suspect,\"" suggesting the accusations against him are somehow related to the speaker\'s race or his criticism of the Russia probe.<br />Trumpiest moments: In a made-for-cable-news moment during a congressional hearing in June, Jordan squared off with Rosenstein.<br />Jordan and his GOP colleagues have demanded more than a million sensitive DOJ documents related to the probe, and they\'ve reacted with fury when the department hasn\'t fully complied with their requests at the speed they want. Flare-ups like the one with Rosenstein have won Jordan favor with the president, who reportedly called him a \""warrior for me\"" in a closed-door meeting with Republicans last month. With Meadows, Jordan led last month\'s unsuccessful push to impeach Rosenstein.<br />Will he be reelected? Probably. Unless a major shoe drops in the ever-worsening Ohio State scandal, Jordan is widely expected to keep his seat in Ohio\'s conservative 4th District. Janet Garrett, a former teacher and union leader, is hoping that the third time running against Jordan will be the charm. She previously lost to him by more than 30 points in 2014 and 2016.<br />Who is he? Chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee and perhaps Trump\'s top congressional field general in his war on the Russia probe. Trump was actually a big fan of Nunes long before the congressman became one of his leading attack dogs. During the presidential campaign, Trump made an unexpected stop in Nunes\' district to raise money and, after securing the presidency, named the California lawmaker to a leading role on his transition team.<br />Claim to fame: Nunes recused himself last April from the intel committee\'s probe into Russian election interference after disclosing information from classified reports he apparently viewed at the White House. Despite promising to hand off the investigation to Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), Nunes continued to review classified material related to the case and, in May, issued three subpoenas to intelligence officials over unfounded claims that Trump associates were improperly \""unmasked\"" following American surveillance of foreign operatives. The House Ethics Committee ultimately cleared Nunes of any wrongdoing in December.<br />Seeing a lot of fake news from media elites and others who have no interest in violations of Americans\' civil liberties via unmaskings.<br />- Devin Nunes (@DevinNunes) June 1, 2017<br />Trumpiest moments: Remember #ReleaseTheMemo? That brief social media campaign-trumpeted on Twitter by no less than the president himself-led to a party-line committee vote to release a memo drafted by Nunes and his staff that blasted federal law enforcement officials\' handling of the Russia investigation. In true Trumpian fashion, Nunes didn\'t let facts get in the way of a compelling narrative. The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, called the memo \""rife with factual inaccuracies\"" and later released a blistering Democratic rebuttal disproving one of Nunes\' central claims.<br />Will he be reelected? Probably. For the past decade, Nunes has sailed to reelection in the conservative 22nd District, where Democrats have tended to only run candidates of the \""sacrificial lamb variety,\"" Fresno State political science professor Tom Holyoke told Mother Jones in February. Enter 34-year-old Andrew Janz, a Fresno prosecutor whose nearly $2.9 million fundraising haul and viral campaign ads may give Nunes his closest fight to date. Democrats shouldn\'t expect any miracles though: Nunes beat Janz by more than 30,000 votes in the state\'s so-called \""jungle primary\"" in June, and the Cook Political Report still rates the district as \""solid Republican.\""<br />Is he the one that...? Yes, Gianforte famously body-slammed a reporter shortly before winning a special election for Montana\'s sole seat in the House. Gianforte pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge the next month and was ordered to attend anger management classes and perform 40 hours of community service.<br />Weird factoid: In Montana, where the right to fish freely is paramount, Gianforte caught flak during an ultimately unsuccessful gubernatorial bid when a blog uncovered evidence that he and his wife attempted to close a fishing access site near his property in Bozeman. That\'s a big no-no for Montana\'s anglers, who depend on liberal public access laws to fish.<br />Will he be reelected? Republicans have held Montana\'s at-large congressional seat for more than two decades, but Gianforte may be in for a tight race against Democratic challenger Kathleen Williams. A June poll showed Williams with a 6-point lead, though the Cook Political Report still rates the Montana race as leaning Republican.<br />Who is he? Four years before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dethroned the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, a little-known economics professor named Dave Brat was cementing the Tea Party revolution with a shocking GOP primary win over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the 2014 primary. Brat\'s win spelled trouble for establishment Republicans like Cantor: A year later, Trump would enter the presidential race.<br />Trumpiest moment: In his campaign against Cantor, Brat was outspent by nearly 10-to-1, and polls had Cantor winning up until Election Day. But Brat rocketed into Washington on the backs of high-profile supporters like conservative media personality Laura Ingraham and Breitbart, the latter of which was once called \""platform for the alt-right\"" by former chairman Steve Bannon. Two years after the Republican National Committee\'s so-called \""autopsy report\"" urged the party to expand minority outreach and embrace comprehensive immigration reform-generally understood to mean legalization for undocumented immigrants-Ingraham and Breitbart backed conservatives like Brat who would hold the line against any attempt to soften the party\'s stance on immigration. Cantor represented the party establishment, the same GOP bigwigs who signed off on the \""Gang of 8\"" immigration bill that cleared the Senate during Obama\'s second term but died in the House. It\'s no coincidence that Ingraham, Bannon, and the writers at Breitbart became some of Trump\'s staunchest supporters in 2016.<br />Will he be reelected? Democrats certainly hope not. After staying mostly under the radar since his shocking victory, Brat now finds himself in a toss-up race against former CIA operative Abigail Spanberger. Virginia\'s 7th District went for Trump in 2016, but Dems are betting that its suburban voters will reject Brat in the same way many of them appear to be turning on Trump.<br />Who is he? A three-term congressman from upstate New York, the first sitting lawmaker to endorse Trump for president, and, as of August 8, a defendant in a federal case accusing him of insider trading.<br />What is he accused of doing? As a board member of an Australia-based pharmaceutical company, Collins allegedly informed his son of the results of a failed drug trial that eventually caused the company\'s stock to plummet by 92 percent. According to prosecutors, this nonpublic information allowed Collins\' son and others to trade away stock in a manner that helped the defendants and their associates avoid more than $768,000 in potential losses. Collins\' attorneys said in a statement that they \""are confident he will be completely vindicated and exonerated.\""<br />His other greatest hits: As a local official, Collins had already been pegged by the New York Daily News as having a case of \""foot-in-mouth disease.\"" Among his more eyebrow-raising statements: comparing New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to Adolf Hitler and the Antichrist and allegedly telling a woman during former Gov. David Paterson\'s crowded State of the State address that she could find a place to sit if she offered \""someone a lap dance.\""<br />Will he be reelected? Who knows? After the news of Collins\' arrest broke, the Cook Political Report changed Collins\' ruby-red district from \""solid\"" to \""likely\"" Republican. His Democratic challenger, Nate McMurray, has urged supporters to \""FIGHT LIKE HELL.\""<br />Who is he? A freshman congressman from Minnesota once described as \""mini Trump.\"" He was previously a political commentator and radio host-more on that in a second.<br />Most notable quotes: On his syndicated radio show, Lewis described the \""vast majority of young single women\"" as \""nonthinking\"" and \""simply ignorant of the important issues in life.\"" That\'s not all. A CNN report recently disclosed that during one broadcast he also said, \""It used to be that women were held to a little bit of a higher standard. We required modesty from women. Now, are we beyond those days where a woman can behave as a slut, but you can\'t call her a slut?\""<br />Will he be reelected? It could be close. Lewis is considered one of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents after eking out a victory in 2016 over returning Democratic challenger Angie Craig. This time around, Craig hopes for a different result. With the support of EMILY\'s List and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, she has outraised Lewis and turned the 2nd District race into a nail-biter.<br />Who is he? A 15-term congressman from California, former speechwriter to former President Ronald Reagan, and reportedly \""so valuable\"" to Russian intelligence that the Kremlin gave him a code name. Rohrabacher\'s passionate defenses of Russia were so widely known that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) once said privately, \""There\'s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.\"" (After a recording of the comment surfaced, a McCarthy spokesman said it was a joke.)<br />Does it concern him that he is seen as so close to Russia? Apparently not. Just last week, Rohrabacher told Mother Jones that anyone in \""this town\"" would have done what Donald Trump, Jr. did-that is, accept a meeting with a Russian emissary promising dirt on a political opponent. Despite his past history as an ardent cold warrior, Rohrabacher has used his recent tenure as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats to trumpet his pro-Russia views.<br />What else is he known for? Rohrabacher has used his perch on the House science committee to describe global warming as a \""fraud.\"" In a state where wildfires have become a routine, destructive occurrence in the summer, Rohrabacher has pushed back on the connection between worsening fires and climate change. \""This exemplifies the tactics-the scare tactics-of those who\'ve been pushing this global warming fraud on us,\"" he said during a spate of fires in August 2013. \""They\'ll take something that is dramatic, like a fire, and try and use that, or a tornado, or a hurricane, and say, \'See, people are being hurt.\'\""<br />Will he be reelected? Once considered to be in a safely Republican district, Rohrabacher\'s seat is now listed as a \""toss-up\"" by the Cook Political Report. A July Monmouth University poll found Democratic challenger Harley Rouda with a slight edge over the longtime congressman.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGapWKypWXr2H-ti_mxCXnunC-c7Q&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=2ThtW-jIFM-2zAbHl6WQBQ&url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/08/trumpiest-members-congress-jim-jordan-devin-nunes-chris-collins-dana-rohrabacher/,EN,,10/08/2018 07:01,2018-08-09 08:01:42+00:00,32e31fcbad,Mother Jones,,,,,1533808902,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4479ceef3b,Why Running Sometimes Makes You Shit Blood - Deadspin,"Why Running Sometimes Makes You Shit Blood<br />Image: Jim Cooke/GMG, Getty[1]Welcome to Meat Sack, a guide to sports-related body horror. Today\'s column is about bloody shits.[2]What do you picture when you think of a runner? Shirtless white men, trotting down the exhaust-choked sidewalks of busy streets, looking like jaunty, tan crepes? Or maybe you see a virtuous sort, full of the kind of piety that only chia pudding and daily meditation and predawn runs can bestow? I used to think of my grandpa, an early adopter of the new jogging trend in the 1960s. He was covered by the local paper after alarming residents with his seemingly compulsive mobility. And sure, sometimes I think about my own attempts at becoming A Runner, the way I assume some people long to become monks. But now, thanks to the wonders of the internet, when I think about running, I think about bloody shits.Running has a lot to do with pooping, but we don\'t usually talk about it. All that blood, sequestered away from the colon, available for use in the muscles; all the mechanical jostling of the bowel: these things can change a person\'s plans, if you know what I mean. In a study of 109 distance runners[3], 62 percent of them reported they\'d had to stop and take a mid-training shit; 12 percent had shit themselves while still running. Not only that, but nearly half had diarrhea after a race or grueling workout, with 16 percent of the total group reporting they\'d shit blood after a hard run.I don\'t know about you, but when I fantasize about what my life would look like were I the kind of woman with nice leggings and a golden retriever that needs running at precisely 6:00 a.m. every morning, I don\'t think about the stark reality of shitting blood in suburban bushes sans toilet paper. But perhaps that just goes to show my ignorance.This all started because I stumbled across an Ask the Coaches column at Runner\'s World from 2006, titled \""Rectal Bleeding.\"" In the answer, Dr. Cathy Fieseler stated that \""blood in the stool following a strenuous workout or race is fairly common.\"" I\'m not sure why I, a non-runner with bad knees, was toodling around that particular website; the point is that the doctor writing the advice column seemed pretty relaxed about runners shitting blood and that brought up some questions for me. The reader\'s query, in full:\""Q: Rectal Bleeding: I started running this year, I am 44 years old and when I started increasing my running to run a Half Marathon I started having rectal bleeding. I have been scoped and nothing was found. How common is this and will this go away. Help! This gets in the way of my running! -Thanks Kellie\""Help! This gets in the way of my running! begs an entirely different set of questions, namely philosophical ones regarding how much a person needs love something for shitting blood to not deter, but we are here to talk about physical shit, not metaphorical, so put a pin in that.The doctor responding to Kellie\'s query is glad she\'s had a negative scope and assures her that while rectal bleeding is always a concern, her plight is a common occurrence. The likely culprits, she notes, are the usual suspects: lack of blood flow to the bowel and the pavement pounding rhythms that shake loose the precious cargo of the gut. (It could also be hemorrhoids or rectal fissures.) Advice was dispensed (stay hydrated and be aware that anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and aspirin can increase bleeding), and the whole column wraps up on a fairly positive note: If it\'s exercised-induced ischemic colitis, the problem should get better as Kellie\'s body gets used to longer runs.I, on the other hand, still had many questions. Namely: how, exactly, can running make you shit blood?The answer starts with ischemia. In simple terms, ischemia happens when a part of the body isn\'t getting enough blood. We commonly talk about it in terms of myocardial ischemia, when blood flow to the heart is reduced, starving it of oxygen. This is also called a heart attack. But it can happen elsewhere, and anytime part of the ol\' meat sack isn\'t getting enough oxygen and glucose, there will be consequences. The bowels of the human body are a needful, sensitive thing. Normally, the colon receives anywhere from 10 to 35 percent of total cardiac output; this means that every time your heart pumps, one-tenth to one-third of the blood goes south to do the job of nourishing the colon and ultimately participate in the transport of nutrients away from the digestive organ.The arteries that feed the colon are very sensitive too, especially to vasoconstriction. Researchers believe that this attuned ability to quickly decrease blood flow to the colon is an evolutionary adaptation to send blood to the brain and heart in times of stress, like running from a lion.Or for pleasure. Or pain. Or some combination of the two.Here\'s the rub: If blood flow to the colon drops by half, we are now in the territory of ischemic colitis. When this happens, there can be hemorrhaging and swelling, with a side of premature cell death and/or ulceration, literal bits of you washing off into a swamp of shit, dying as they scream for oxygen. Certain parts of the colon are more predisposed to suffering these effects. Called the \""watershed\"" areas, these are weak points because they get less blood than the rest of the colon, thanks to their proximity to vascularization.What could possibly cause blood flow to the colon to drop by half?Picture again, the runner. Legs pumping, arms swinging, breathing like a laboring sheep. With each step, their body is a piston-cum-shock absorber, propelling them through space and time, sweat creeping onto and off of their skin. Normally pressed to howl in need, their muscles swell and demand, lungs working overtime to oxygenate enough blood to pass around the body. The struggle repeats itself, over and over and over, to meet this new set of needs. Sorry colon, the threat we run from is real, and you, sweet friend, must make a gentle sacrifice today. It may not be a lion at our backs; perhaps it\'s the looming threat of financial crisis, or a bad date last night, or just the desperate need to indulge in some euphoric masochism to get through another fucking day. Either way.Help! This gets in the way of my running! The runner, wincing at the tarry mess in the toilet. It\'s a watershed moment, the first time you shit blood for something you love.Do you have questions about sports-related bodily horror?

4437a29421,Farming column: Rain holds back the harvest - The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald,"Rain holds back the harvest (From The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald)<br />AT the beginning of week barometric pressure began to fall, which led to a rather unsettled and very stormy week with rainfall amounting to 23mm (almost an inch), not very good weather for harvesting our fields of winter wheat.<br />However, it has given us time to have our yearling heifers freeze branded. Freeze branding is a process that involves using liquid nitrogen or dry ice and alcohol to cool a branding iron to between -160 C and -250 C, depending on which coolant is used. The cooled iron is then pressed against the animal\'s skin, which alters the hair follicles in the area covered. The hair in the branded area will fall out and after two or three months will grow back with no pigment (white). Even when the animal sheds its winter coat the new hair will always grow back white. Freeze branding is a very effective way of identifying cattle, with highly visible white numbers on their rumps.<br />While the heifers were being restrained for branding it was an ideal time to give them their first vaccination to protect them against Leptospirosis, caused by a bacteria.<br />There are two strains of leptospira which infect the kidneys and genital tract of cattle. It is spread most often when cattle are at pasture causing infertility, abortion and poor milk yield. It can infect humans giving them influenza like symptoms,with dairymen being very susceptible, as the disease is spread via urine, milk and placentas.<br />Vaccinating is the best way of ensuring our cattle remain free of Leptospirosis. When both freeze-branding and vaccinating had been completed the heifers were moved to fresh pasture.<br />During the week James ploughed one of our fields of temporary grass. This field had been sown with a two-year ley, which has recently been dessicated, spread with slurry and now ploughed to start preparing a seed bed for the sowing of a crop of winter wheat. This is part of our arable rotation for the coming year. Nathan has cleaned the temporary storage area in one of our barns in readiness for the wheat, which is now ripe and can be harvested when the weather allows.<br />As we have no drying facility we try to harvest our grain when it is below 15 per cent moisture, so it will not incur a drying charge when it is delivered to a local grain store.<br />On Stowell Farm Kevin has been separating out ewe lambs that have been sold, which will then be ready to go to their new home this week. Four flocks of between 100 and 200 ewe lambs have been sold recently, some have gone to Staffordshire and the rest to locations in the Bath and Bristol area.<br />Recently Kevin and Melissa have managed to get 21 of the 26 shearling rams (ram lambs born in 2016 ) registered with the Pedigree Lleyn Society. Shearling rams must be registered in the summer of this year if you wish to breed and register stock from them.The registered rams are rigorously inspected for structure, conformation and type. Llyen rams are an ideal way to inject maternal traits, fertility and hybrid vigour into breeding ewes.<br />They have also become popular for crossing onto hill and lowland ewes to produce prime lamb or Llyen x female replacements that carry the qualities of the Llyen ewe.<br />Llyens are durable, docile, easily produce enough milk to rear two lambs, have good carcass quality for both home and export markets. They also have fine, dense, medium length wool, which is water repellent and pure white. Llyen wool grades as medium with the British Wool Board.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGblAlYxQ3sVvm24MTKcxkD-XFAoA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=TlaNWaieN4WuW9SWofgB&url=http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/NEWS/15457468.Farming_column__Rain_holds_back_the_harvest/,EN,,11/08/2017 07:01,2017-08-10 00:15:00+00:00,95c728a7b8,The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald,,,,,1502331300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e13232eb00,"Soligenix Announces $700,000 Subaward Supporting Development ... - Markets Insider","Soligenix Announces $700,000 Subaward Supporting Development Collaboration on Thermostabilization of an Ebola Vaccine Candidate<br />PRINCETON, N.J., Sept. 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that Soligenix will be participating in a Research Project (R01) grant awarded to the University of Hawai\'i at Manoa (UH Manoa) for the development of a thermostabilized Ebola vaccine, with Soligenix awarded funding of approximately $700,000 over 5 years. Previous collaborations with Axel Lehrer, PhD of the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), UH Manoa and Hawaii Biotech, Inc. (HBI) demonstrated the feasibility of developing a heat stable subunit Ebola vaccine.  Under the terms of the subaward, Soligenix will continue to support vaccine formulation development with its proprietary vaccine thermostabilization technology, ThermoVax®.  Ultimately, the objective is to produce a thermostable trivalent filovirus vaccine for protection against Ebola and related diseases, allowing worldwide distribution without the need for cold storage.  The most advanced Ebola vaccines involve the use of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and adenovirus vectors - live, viral vectors which complicate the manufacturing, stability and storage requirements.  Dr. Lehrer\'s vaccine is based on highly purified recombinant protein antigens, circumventing many of these manufacturing difficulties.  Dr. Lehrer and HBI have developed a robust manufacturing process for the required proteins.  Thermostabilization may allow for a product that can avoid the need for cold-chain distribution and storage, yielding a vaccine ideal for use in both the developed and developing world.\""Filoviruses are endemic in areas of the world where the power supply can be uncertain, making a thermostable Ebola vaccine particularly valuable,\"" stated Dr. Lehrer, Assistant Professor, Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology at the JABSOM.  \""We are delighted to have been awarded this grant to further develop a thermostabilized subunit vaccine for Ebola and look forward to continuing our collaboration with Soligenix.\""\""We believe that creating a vaccine with enhanced stability at elevated temperatures, which can obviate the costs and logistical burdens associated with cold chain storage and distribution, has the potential to provide a distinct advantage over other Ebola vaccines currently in development,\"" stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. \""Work with the Ebola vaccine expands upon our thermostabilization platform which has already been successfully utilized with other heat sensitive vaccine candidates, such as for ricin toxin, and anthrax.  We continue to actively pursue government grants and contracts across our entire biodefense and biotherapeutics pipeline and are appreciative of the ongoing support, with non-dilutive awards now exceeding $8M in 2017.\""About Ebola Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is caused by one of five species of Ebolavirus, four of which cause disease in humans, including its best-known member, Zaire Ebolavirus (Ebola virus).  All species of Ebolavirus belong to the Filoviridae family, a family that further contains the equally human pathogenic Marburgvirus.  The Ebola virus is believed to be harbored in various animal species in Africa, although the specific reservoir host is still unknown.  There have been several known EVD outbreaks in Africa since 1976, with the largest outbreak starting in 2014 in Western Africa.Transmission of Ebola requires direct contact of bodily fluids from an infected person or contact with infected animals.  The mortality rate from Ebola infection is extremely high, and can sometimes be affected by the quality of supportive care available with a focus on early initiation of treatment.  Symptoms of Ebola virus infection include high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and unexplained hemorrhage.  Resolution of the disease largely depends on the patient\'s own immune system.  There is no approved treatment and no approved vaccine for Ebola, although research into both has accelerated since the onset of the 2014 outbreak.The Ebola outbreak in 2014 primarily spanned three West African countries, and involved over 26,000 confirmed/probable/suspected cases with an estimated death toll of over 11,000 people according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including some cases in Europe and the United States.  The widespread nature of the infection and its devastating impact has further illustrated the need to develop an Ebola vaccine to prevent future and possibly more significant outbreaks.About ThermoVax®The ThermoVax® technology is designed to eliminate the cold chain production, distribution and storage logistics required for most vaccines. The technology utilizes precise lyophilization of protein immunogens with conventional aluminum adjuvants in combination with secondary adjuvants for rapid onset of protective immunity with the fewest number of vaccinations. Cold chain requirements add considerable cost to the production and storage of current conventional vaccines. Elimination of the cold chain would also enhance the utility of these vaccines for emerging markets and for other applications requiring but lacking reliable cold chain capabilities. For vaccines that are intended for long-term stockpiling, such as for use in biodefense or in pandemic situations, the utilization of ThermoVax® has the potential to facilitate easier storage and distribution of Strategic National Stockpile vaccines in emergency situations. The underlying ThermoVax® technology has been developed by Drs. John Carpenter and Theodore Randolph at the University of Colorado.By employing ThermoVax® during the final formulation of RiVax®, the vaccine has demonstrated enhanced stability and the ability to withstand temperatures at least as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for up to one year. Similar stabilization at temperatures as high as 50 degrees Celsius for up to 3 months (maximum timepoint tested) have also been demonstrated with other antigens (e.g., human papillomavirus, Ebola and anthrax).About John A.

e136b3da2f,Milosevic-Djindjic Struggle Continues Long After Their Deaths - Balkan Insight,"Milosevic-Djindjic Struggle Continues Long After Their Deaths :: Balkan Insight<br />With the date of his death, Slobodan Milosevic undermined the commemoration of the memory of the murdered Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.<br />Milosevic died at the Hague Tribunal on March 13, 2006, whereas Djindjic was murdered on March 12, 2003.<br />Hence, as fate would have it, Milosevic had his posthumous \'revenge\' on Djindjic for his defeat in the 2000 elections and for his extradition to the Tribunal in June 2001.<br />For years now, Milosevic\'s supporters have meddled with every annual remembrance of the murdered Djindjic, directly or indirectly. This year was no exception.<br />On March 9, Milosevic\'s fans filed a request to the Belgrade authorities for their \'hero\' to be honoured with a monument and for a street in the Serbian capital to be named after him.<br />\""Milosevic\'s regime left graves, sanctions and hopelessness - Djindjic\'s government restored hope. Monuments for both would make Serbia a schizophrenic community.\""<br />The move puts pressure on the Belgrade authorities, who in March 2017, on the initiative of then prime minister Aleksandar Vucic, announced a competition to create a monument for Djindjic.<br />An atmosphere is being created in which it is logical that if Djindjic has a monument and a street, then Milosevic should have one too.<br />As if the two men fought for the same values, when, in fact, their values and politics were complete opposites.<br />Milosevic came out from under Josip Broz Tito\'s communist cloak, whereas Djindjic was part of the democratic, civil Serbia. Milosevic generated wars, Djindjic made peace.<br />Milosevic\'s regime left graves, sanctions and hopelessness - Djindjic\'s government restored hope.<br />A monument for one of them excludes the glorification of the other. Monuments for both would make Serbia a schizophrenic community.<br />Nothing could be saved from what Milosevic \'built\'. A lot of the things Djindjic tried to do have been destroyed. But the most important remains - Serbia\'s turn towards the European Union.<br />However, there\'s not much chance it will persevere with that course, despite the accession negotiations, because this path depends not on Djindjic\'s cadre, but on that of Milosevic. It is like entrusting the Catalan separatists with ensuring Spain\'s integrity.<br />Though the Milosevic-Djindjic conflict was ended by their deaths, the duel is being continued by their associates and followers even with the two men gone.<br />The disputes between Milosevic\'s and Djindjic\'s politics continues - in other words, between Milosevic\'s and Djindjic\'s visions of Serbia. In this showdown, Djindjic is headed for another defeat.<br />There is no one to fight for Djindjic and his ideas. His followers are powerless, and his associates have either been defeated or stripped of power like former President Boris Tadic, or they switched sides and went and teamed up with Vucic and his ruling Progressive Party - as in the case of politicians like Goran Vesic and Sinisa Mali.<br />One of the rare ones who was and remained a Djindjic supporter is MP Zoran Zivkovic, a man who was briefly at the helm of the Serbian government after Djindjic\'s murder.<br />\""Erecting a monument to Milosevic, one of the wreckers of Yugoslavia, the man whose politics devastated Serbia and its surroundings, would be like killing Djindjic for a second time.\""<br />Things are completely different for Milosevic.<br />Serbia is now led by his student Ivica Dacic - head of the Serbian foreign ministry and of Milosevic\'s Socialist Party of Serbia - and Milosevic\'s former coalition partners Aleksandar Vulin, who is now defence minister, and Aleksandar Vucic, who is now president of Serbia.<br />There are also the secret services, which have been left unreformed, and an army of apparatchiks from Milosevic\'s time.<br />In order to understand the entire situation, one should know that Tomislav Nikolic and Vojislav Seselj - former colleagues in the hardline nationalist Serbian Radical Party and the political \'parents\' of Aleksandar Vucic, currently the most powerful man in Serbia - announced Djindjic\'s murder and rejoiced over the news.<br />In 2007, Vucic himself, along with his then colleagues from the Serbian Radical Party, posted a Ratko Mladic Street sign over the sign for Zoran Djindjic Boulevard, which had been named after the murdered premier following his death.<br />When Milosevic died, Vucic, Nikolic and the wife of Seselj, who was on trial at the Hague Tribunal at the time, stood in the guard of honour next to the casket.<br />Most importantly, the forces we have in office today have completely restored Milosevic\'s populist rule.<br />The people live in fear and poverty, one man makes all the decisions, while conflicts with those with different opinions are maintained and heated up.<br />The media have less freedom than ever, and the justice system and other institutions usually operate under party directives.<br />The only thing that Vucic did not perpetuate - for pragmatic reasons - was Milosevic\'s military conflicts and disputes with the West.<br />So why would someone like Vucic suggest erecting a monument to Zoran Djindjic?<br />For two reasons: Firstly, to show how he has changed and evolved, how he has gone from opposing to advocating EU integration, and inherently from Djindjic\'s adversary to his admirer. Secondly - and perhaps more importantly - it annoys Djindjic\'s supporters and associates.<br />They could have erected a monument while they had the power to do so from 2003 to 2012, but they did not - which represents another humiliation.<br />One of the reasons they did not was because Vucic and his party comrades would have torn it down like they tried to change the name of Zoran Djindjic Boulevard.<br />The proposal to erect a monument and name a street after Milosevic has not been filed to be rejected, and it did not face condemnation from members of Vucic\'s clique.<br />They are silent, and it is not excluded that at some point the project to honour Milosevic will be put into action - for the same reason as the erection of the monument to Djindjic, to upset the former premier\'s supporters and the democratic public. And of course, to maintain social tension.<br />Erecting a monument to Milosevic, one of the wreckers of Yugoslavia, the man whose politics devastated Serbia and its surroundings, would be like killing Djindjic for a second time.<br />His murder however was enabled by what he did not do when he was alive and in power: lustration - the temporary or permanent elimination from political life of Milosevic\'s crew, his cadre, his coalition partners and secret services.<br />After being out of power for several years, all of them ultimately came back, some of them now wearing sheep\'s clothing - but the wolves are still underneath.<br />Milenko Vasovic is a renowned Serbian journalist and an editor at daily newspaper Danas.<br />The opinions expressed in the Comment section are those of the authors only and do not necessarily reflect the views of BIRN.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFxsRWsncqZ07PakpM5EzbgBCwThA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779840351745&ei=dGOzWriuIs-BzQb9kaTwBg&url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/milosevic-djindjic-struggle-continues-long-after-their-deaths-03-20-2018,EN,,22/03/2018 08:01,2018-03-22 05:41:30+00:00,7903d30a98,Balkan Insight,,,,,1521700890,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e14ca8361e,Bixin protects skin against solar UV induced damage - Health Newstrack,"Bixin protects skin against solar UV induced damage<br />Bixin protects skin against solar UV induced damageResearchers have discovered that a compound found in the natural food additive annatto prevents the formation of cancer cells and skin damage from UV radiation in mice. In the future the compound, bixin, may be valuable in the prevention and treatment of human skin cancers.Georg Wondrak, PhD, associate professor, and Donna Zhang, PhD, professor, both members of the University of Arizona Cancer Center, recently published a study in Free Radical Biology and Medicine titled, \""System Administration of the Apocarotenoid Bixin Protects Skin against Solar UV-Induced Damage through Activation of Nrf2.\""Bixin is a bright reddish orange compound found in annatto, a natural condiment and food coloring derived from the seeds of the achiote fruit. Annatto, also known as achiote, has been a common ingredient in Latin American cooking since the pre-Columbian era.Achiote (Bixa orellana) is a shrub or small tree originating from the tropical region of the Americas. North, Central and South American natives originally used the seeds to make red body paint and lipstick. For this reason, the achiote is sometimes called the lipstick tree.The tree is best known as the source of annatto, a natural orange-red condiment (also called \""achiote\"" or \""bijol\"") obtained from the waxy arils that cover its seeds. The ground seeds are widely used in traditional dishes in South and Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico; such as cochinita pibil, chicken in achiote and caldo de olla. Annatto and its extracts are also used as an industrial food coloring to add yellow or orange color to many products such as butter, cheese, sausages, cakes, and popcorn.Dr. Wondrak\'s lab works to find small molecules, often in edible plants, that can prevent skin cancer. Dr. Zhang is a leading expert on the Nrf2 transcription factor, which strengthens cells against exposure to carcinogens. Dr. Wondrak\'s investigations occasionally identify a compound that activates the Nrf2 pathway, and he calls on Dr. Zhang to collaborate in determining whether the compound has cancer-preventive properties.In the recent study, mice injected with bixin and uninjected mice were exposed to UV radiation. The mice with the bixin injection experienced much less severe skin sun damage.Dr. Wondrak says this discovery is unique because bixin is a nutritional factor, not a sunscreen applied to the skin. It prevents UV skin damage from the inside out by inducing cells to make protective antioxidants and repair factors. The compound does not kill skin cancer cells, but prevents their forming in the first place. Drs. Wondrak and Zhang find this research especially compelling because it involves a commonly consumed food substance.The next steps for this line of research include finding out whether bixin prevents UV skin damage in humans as it does in mice. Because annatto is approved by the Food and Drug Administration asa safe food additive, its use in future clinical trials is expected to require fewer rounds of testing. With continued research into bixin\'s effects, scientists soon may know if foods with annatto can help prevent sun damage, photo-aging and cancer in humans.Source: University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, USA.<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEzF3Y-TRrCTb1Z63uDq-VMGmEtPA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=I0HZVpC2CI7Za__sg5AC&url=http://healthnewstrack.com/bixin-protects-skin-against-solar-uv-induced-damage_3618/,EN,,04/03/2016 08:04,2016-01-29 03:03:10+00:00,5705f8234a,Health Newstrack,,,,,1454040190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e1595b9461,Conflict may follow Obama declaring Utah land a national monument - Las Vegas Review-Journal,"Conflict may follow Obama declaring Utah land a national monument<br />RIM OF CEDAR MESA, Utah - For centuries, humans have used the red sandstone canyons here as a way to mark their existence.First came archaic hunter-gatherers who worked in Glen Canyon Linear, a crude geometrical style dating back more than 3,500 years. Then about 2,000 years later, early ancestral Pueblo farmers of the Basketmaker period used more subtle lines to produce a man in headdress. A little more than 700 years ago came their descendants, who used the same kind of hard river stone to make drawings of bighorn sheep and a flute player in the ancient rock.Now, President Barack Obama is weighing whether and how he can leave his own permanent imprint on history by designating about 2 million acres of land, known as the Bears Ears, as a national monument.And despite the acknowledged historical significance of the area, some people regard the conservation efforts by the White House as federal overreach. In the current-era conflict between Washington and rural Westerners, the idea of a Bears Ears national monument has produced warnings of a possible armed insurrection.In a state where the federal government owns 65 percent of the land, many conservatives already resent existing restrictions because they bar development that could generate additional revenue. Out-of-state militias came to San Juan County two years ago, when Commissioner Phil Lyman helped lead a protest ride on all-terrain vehicles through a canyon the Bureau of Land Management had closed to motorized traffic in 2007.\""I would hope that my fellow Utahns would not use violence, but there are some deeply held positions that cannot just be ignored,\"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, the veteran Republican, said in an interview.Cedar Mesa is one of the best preserved and most archaeologically rich sites in the United States. The dry climate and rock overhangs have protected important artifacts for millennia, and there are tens of thousands of ancient objects and structures preserved, including ones in which the original wood beams in cliff dwellings remain intact. In a granary where the Pueblo people kept maize, a single dried cob lies on a dusty floor.But some lawmakers have suggested unilateral action by the president, under the 1906 Antiquities Act, could provoke the same sort of resistance that led to the 41-day armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon earlier this year.\""There is a lot of conflict that has escalated into being on the precipice of violence that is unnecessary and unwarranted,\"" said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who opposes the designation.Obama has approached the designation of national monuments as a way to bolster the country\'s defenses against climate change and as a way to make the national narrative more inclusive.LOOTING AND DEGRADATION In the case of Bears Ears, there is no question that the area is imperiled by the kind of looting and pillaging that first inspired the Antiquities Act, as well as more modern threats such as ATVs and motorbikes tearing through the desert terrain.There have been six confirmed looting incidents in the past six months and at least two dozen over the past five years. Although the BLM has allocated $400,000 over two years to stabilize 10 archaeological sites and trained about 20 people to serve as volunteer \""site stewards,\"" it employs just two law enforcement officers to patrol 1.8 million acres.Without help from Washington, preservationists worry that the looting and destruction will continue. Word of the region\'s treasures has spread from academics and archaeologists to \""pot hunters\"" and other looters, said Don Simonis, the BLM\'s archeologist for the area. \""For years we\'ve been reluctant to talk about it, but if we don\'t talk about it, how else can we convince the powers that be that we need protection here, and get the resources we need to protect it?\""But in the Bears Ears region, named for the twin buttes that define the landscape, and surrounding San Juan County there are competing claims to the land and its history. The area has been home over the centuries to Native American tribes, Mormon settlers who reshaped the land in the late 1800s and the energy prospectors, ranchers and thrill-seekers drawn to it today.On May 19, Utah Gov.

But those proposals have drawn criticism from environmentalists and tribal leaders, in part because they give state and local officials greater say over managing federal lands and redefine what activities can take place in protected areas.Scott Groene, executive director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, has dubbed the plan the \""Plundered Lands Initiative.\"" He said it \""gives away vast amounts of public land, sacrifices landscapes to energy development, rolls back existing protection and fails to protect the Bears Ears.\""And a coalition of tribal groups - including representatives from the Hopi, Navajo, Uintah and Ouray Ute, Ute Mountain Ute and Pueblo of Zuni - abandoned what had been fitful talks with Utah Republicans in December, saying they were not given a proper voice in shaping the deal.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHBGfQF5f6916yX3ISbq8KGq2a32g&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779135316256&ei=rUFmV5jHOeaLzAbAv4fABg&url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/conflict-may-follow-obama-declaring-utah-land-national-monument,EN,,19/06/2016 07:03,2016-06-18 23:17:09+00:00,5b41d61294,ournal,,,,,1466299029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e231010d3a,"Trump tells story about killing terrorists with bullets dipped in pigs\' blood, though there\'s no proof of it - Washington Post","Trump tells story about killing terrorists with bullets dipped in pigs\' blood, though there\'s no proof of it<br />Donald Trump waves goodbye after a rally at the North Charleston Convention Center in South Carolina on Friday. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. - To explain his support for waterboarding and other heavy-handed interrogation tactics, Donald Trump told a rally audience a story Friday night that involved U.S. Gen. John J. Pershing, a terrorist attack in the Philippines more than a century ago, 50 terrorists and bullets dipped in pigs\' blood. It\'s a tale that has circulated on the Internet for years - and is most likely not true. The story came up as Trump reiterated his support for waterboarding, the advanced interrogation technique that the Obama administration considers torture and has ceased using. Earlier this week, Trump said he supports this controversial method, along with those that are \""much worse,\"" because \""torture works.\"" Proponents of waterboarding have long been careful to not label it as torture, which is strictly forbidden by U.S. and international law. [Donald Trump: \""Torture works\""[1]] \""The big question is: Is it torture or not?\"" Trump said at a rally at a convention center here, the night before the South Carolina primary. \""It\'s so borderline. It\'s like your minimal, minimal, minimal torture.\"" Trump criticized his Republican rivals for not embracing waterboarding as enthusiastically as he has, which he says sends the wrong message to terrorists who use barbaric techniques like chopping off the heads of their foes. \""You know, I read story - it\'s a terrible story, but I\'ll tell you,\"" Trump said. \""Should I tell you? Or should I not?\"" As the crowd cheered him on, Trump told them about Pershing - \""rough guy, rough guy\"" - who was fighting terrorism in the early 1900s. Trump didn\'t say where this happened, but variations of this story online usually state that it happened in the Philippines during the Philippine-American War, early in Pershing\'s career. \""They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\"" Trump said. \""And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs\' blood - you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs\' blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn\'t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn\'t a problem.\"" At one point in telling this story, Trump said: \""By the way, this is something you can read in the history books - not a lot of history books because they don\'t like teaching this.\"" [Donald Trump\'s final pitch to South Carolina[2]] Although Trump never used the word \""Muslim\"" in this story, he was clearly referring to Muslim terrorists and at one point commented: \""There\'s a whole thing with swine and animals and pigs, and - you know the story, you know they don\'t like that.\"" Pigs are considered impure by the Qur\'an, so the pigs\' blood on the bullets could keep a Muslim from entering heaven. Trump finished the story with this message: \""So we better start getting tough, and we better start getting vigilant, and we better start using our heads, or we\'re not going to have a country, folks. We\'re not going to have a country.\"" A guy in the audience then shouted: \""This is the greatest country in the world.\"" While the story was well received by the cheering audience, it appears to be more of a military fable than a history lesson. The website snopes.com - which investigates urban legends, myths, rumors and pretty much anything forwarded in a chain email - could find little proof[3] that the story is true. There are several versions of the tale circulating, including one in which the prisoners were buried with dead pigs. Trump\'s campaign has yet to respond to a request for comment. Jenna Johnson is a political reporter who is covering the 2016 presidential campaign.

e23104f093,Jim Bakker prepares Missouri town for Eclipse fallout | Daily Mail ... - Daily Mail,"Jim Bakker prepares Missouri town for Eclipse fallout<br />As President Donald Trump promised to unleash \'fire and fury\' on North Korea,  a slightly-built, bearded TV evangelist bragged of his recent visit to the White House and warned of an up-coming \'nuclear winter.\'Jim Bakker\'s studio audience whooped and cheered - before reaching deep into their pockets to buy \'Staying Alive\' food - buckets full of freeze-dried products apparently capable of sustaining survivors through the Apocalypse.The charismatic pastor then made an impassioned plea for money to keep his ministry afloat - suggesting a year\'s supply of pancakes with a 30-year shelf life for an apparent bargain $550 or four cheaply published books for $40 to tide readers over through Armageddon. <br />Jim Bakker (pictured with wife Lori) uses his platform as a televangelist to sell food buckets full of freeze-dried products, claiming the meals will keep followers alive after the Apocalypse <br />Bakker\'s 60-person audience is mostly comprised of elderly women. He asked for them to send him checks, not cash, to buy survival kits of preserved food <br />Bakker, here during his arrest for fraud,  uses his prison stint as a badge of honor on his show, saying during that time God spoke to him to let him know the world was going to end. Bakker was sentenced to 45 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy and 23 counts of wire and mail fraud in 1989. His sentence was reduced to eight years\'A lot of my grannies send checks,\' he said, as the elderly women who made up the bulk of his 60-strong audience laughed indulgently.Then, somewhat tongue in cheek, the smooth-talking Bakker added: \'Try not to send cash.\'It is astonishing that Bakker - forced out of his last ministry and imprisoned for defrauding his flock of $158 million - has managed to reinvent himself as a doomsday prophet.Yet the Bible - something he confessed he\'d only bothered to fully read during his five-year incarceration - teaches forgiveness. And his followers appear to have forgiven him - not only for his greed but also for the sex scandals that wrecked his holier-than-though image carefully crafted by Bakker and then wife Tammy Faye via their vast Christian TV empire.Tammy Faye - famous for her giant false eyelashes and makeup that appeared to have been applied with a paintbrush - died of cancer, aged 65, in 2007. She has been replaced by lookalike blonde Lori, 18 years Bakker\'s junior, who he married after a whirlwind 50-day romance.Today Lori sits alongside 77-year-old Bakker on his latest TV show, doing the hard-sell on their buckets and books, constantly plugging the Bakker website where end-of-times preppers can stock up on supposedly tasty treats that require nothing more than water to cook.Of course, survivors of nuclear war might be hard pressed to find uncontaminated water. But on Bakker\'s TV shows, he promotes Morningside - home to both his studio and 700 acres he is developing as a Christian community, complete with its own water tower.Bakker has been down this path before. Overselling \'lifetime memberships\' to his South Carolina amusement park and hotel complex led to his 1980s downfall. Morningside is also described as a theme park and features a brightly painted indoor town square dominated by a 15ft tall Jesus statue.When Bakker isn\'t taping his daily show on site, earlier episodes blare out of giant TV screens everywhere, including the complex\'s grubby-looking restaurant. <br />Morningside looks similar to a theme park, featuring a brightly painted indoor town square dominated by a 15ft tall Jesus statue <br />Town homes are available for sale or rent on Morningside\'s grounds. Bakker fanatics can stay at one of the homes for $95 per night A fake church door, plastic flower-filled garden and a quaint cinema sign proclaiming Christ\'s imminent return have supposedly been copied from \'actual oil paintings\' from England and France. The next two floors contain 125 real apartments - available for sale or $95 nightly rental. Tucked away on the grounds are clusters of \'cozy cottages\' and dome-shaped homes also for sale or rental. At the end of one long drive sits a large wooden mansion, named after Lori, to house pregnant women who have fallen on hard times.Lori, 59, admits to a drug-using, promiscuous past - according to the couple\'s website she had five abortions by the age of 22 and then endured an abusive marriage before finding salvation and meeting Bakker in 1998.The couple adopted a family of five children from Arizona and several of them, along with Bakker\'s eldest daughter Tammy Sue, often sit in on the TV shows adding to the folksy feel of each episode. In the 1980s, Bakker\'s own satellite network reached 14 million American homes and aired in 40 plus countries. That network is long gone and today it is hard to gauge viewing figures as Nielsen, the TV ratings service, does not chart Christian TV channels. But Bakker isn\'t shy about selling himself or his wares on TV or on his website. <br />In the eighties, Bakker had a set-up similar to Morningside in South Carolina. He ran Christian-themed amusement park with a hotel complex named Heritage USA until he was arrested in 1989 <br />People travel from all over the country to Morningside to hear Jim Bakker\'s preaching in real life and to stock up on supplies for the end of days  <br />Bakker also hawks vitamins to supplement the nutritional value of the salt-heavy meals in the survival bucketsBakker\'s mansions - complete with gold-plated bathroom fixtures and air-conditioned dog kennels are long gone, along with his antique car collection. He still owes $6 million in back taxes and technically owns nothing.Fellow pastor Jerry Crawford invested $25 million to create Morningside in 2007 and even though there are clusters of \'fuel efficient\' dome homes and tiny cottages on sale for under $190,000 and one-bed condos priced at $68,000, real estate seems more of an afterthought.The real business at Morningside, hidden down a winding mountain road in the sleepy Missouri hamlet of Blue Eye, is end-of-times food. There are buckets of freeze-dried products everywhere.Vietnam vet Glen Ward and his wife Margaret make regular 10-hour drives from their home in Cleveland, Tennessee, to stock up.\'I\'m buying black beans for our pantry. We have 28 buckets already at home,\' Glen, 73, said.His wife insisted she was looking out for her three children and five grandchildren, making sure they would have enough to eat in the event of disaster.\'The end times are near,\' she said ominously. \'I\'ve no idea what is going to happen, it could be hurricanes or war. I don\'t foresee President Trump going to war but we all need to be prepared.\' <br />Vitamins and water filters are sold in the in the sleepy Missouri hamlet of Blue Eye. Fans of Bakker travel from across the country to stock up on Apocalypse supplies  <br />Freeze-dried meals sold in Blue Eye include oatmeal, instant potatoes, chicken soup, rice and chocolate puddingIt\'s a mantra Morningside\'s fast-talking sales reps and wheelchair-bound volunteers repeat constantly as they pounce on anyone hovering around the three stores selling survival goods inside the complex.Full-time Morningside resident Gretchen Frame, a retired Las Vegas waitress who lost a leg to cancer, has the lifestyle down to a T. When she spotted this reporter looking at a $100 bucket containing 102 servings of freeze fried Italian food, she suggested I opt for a much larger tax-free variety she claimed was better value for money. <br />Only 167 people live in Blue Eye Missouri, which is just north of border of Arkansas and is 20 miles south of Branson  The \'Tasty Pantry Deluxe Emergency Food Supply\' - 283 servings containing 49,390 calories - was on sale for $392, down $100 from its usual price. Offering 18 different dishes, including oatmeal, instant potatoes, chicken soup, rice and chocolate pudding, it weighed in at 28 lbs and I couldn\'t lift it up.A salesman immediately offered to help carry it, peppering this reporter with details of the tasty treats inside and telling  how I could use the re-sealable bucket afterwards to store emergency water supplies.He gave up the pitch when I asked where I would find uncontaminated water after a nuclear meltdown. I edged away and hid in the Bible Room, looking at expensive books with the name Trump in the title, a selection of Bakker books and a memoir by ex presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee, father of current White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.After leafing through paperbacks with blaring warnings of the Apocalypse and imminent arrival of the Antichrist, I strolled into one of the other stores and bought a $100 dollar bucket of Italian meals in the interest of research.Advertising a 20-year shelf life, I was a little disappointed when I opened the bucket to discover just 21 pouches of food that were all stamped with January and April 2016 sell-by-dates.The bucket proclaimed there were 102 servings but as each individual packet suggested it was enough for 7.5 servings, presumably you\'d have to invite the neighbors and a small child round to help you eat each one.In sleepy Blue Eye - population 167 - food is already in short supply. The gas station sells chips, dips, beer and hard liquor, a shack-like store sold cigarettes and chewing tobacco. There is also a café proclaiming all-day breakfasts, but it didn\'t open until 11 a.m. and closed just a few hours later. Even Morningside\'s Fireside Cafe shuts down at 7 p.m. <br />The buckets of freeze-dried food weigh 28 pounds and some individual buckets were on sale for $125 marked down from $250 <br />The Italian variety bucket contained a dish labelled \'Italiano Marinara\', which looked and smelled similar to dog food when prepared   <br />The Jim Bakker Show website offers other Apocalypse survival necessities such as portable toilets and vitamins. The product descriptions also boast they can can used for camping COOKING UP A DOOMSDAY STORM I was starving when I started sifting through my bucket trying to decide what to cook. Inevitably silver pouches of what used to be known as astronaut food - sold at NASA and stamped with exciting pictures of men in space suits - don\'t look appetizing. And once opened, the smell is enough to put you off. <br />Each pouch of food comes with a warning to not eat the oxygen absorber. One Italian meal was comprised of tomato powder, white cheddar cheese, cheese culture, burgundy wine flavor and lots of sodium preservativesItaliano Marinara - containing something described as \'lasagna bits,\' tomato powder, white cheddar cheese, cheese culture, burgundy wine flavor and lots of sodium preservatives - looked and smelt like a dog\'s dinner. I held my nose and whisked it up with boiling water and left it to simmer on the stove.I noticed - too late - that each pouch came with a warning not to eat the oxygen absorber inside. I found the postage-sized oxygen sliver floating on top of my sauce and fished it out just before it was absorbed into the marinara. <br />When cooked, the fettuccine was the least photogenic but the most edible of the Italian freeze-dried mealsFettuccine Alfredo - containing egg noodles, cheese, mushroom stock and preservatives that basically translated as lots and lots of salt - smelt faintly of vomit. The smell got stronger once mixed with water and left to simmer. I doubled the cooking time to half-an-hour because it was just a runny mess after 15 minutes.On TV, Bakker plugs the need for his survival buckets, claiming the Bible warns about people selling their souls to the Devil in exchange for food during the Apocalypse. So I reached into my bucket and pulled out pouches of macaroni and cheese - just the sort of comfort food needed to ward off temptation during Armageddon.Sadly, the nuclear-orange color of the cheese reminded me of the supposed fire and brimstone to come and the hue seemed to get brighter the more I stirred. In fact, the mac and cheese was the least successful of the three dishes - it had the consistency of cardboard.The marinara actually tasted better than it smelt, although there was a lingering chemical after taste. When finally cooked, the fettuccine was the least photogenic - it really did look like a plate of vomit. However, it was edible.But I now understand why preppers fill the empty food buckets with water - you are going to want to drink gallons of the stuff to compensate for the high doses of salt in everything. I had hoped to ask Bakker and Lori if they eat their survival food but getting close to the couple is nearly impossible. When taping, they are surrounded by staff and security guards and despite telling viewers they live in Morningside, they do not. Telephone requests for an interview were ignored.Gretchen Frame, the 77-year-old wheelchair-bound volunteer who has lived at Morningside full time for the past six weeks, said: \'We\'re all very protective of him. There have been threats.\'People can be ignorant. I have been verbally abused in Walmart by people who don\'t like Christians.\'There\'s a lot of security here because of the threats and we all watch out for strangers walking through the doors.\'Dad-of-two Thomas Ventura moved from San Diego, California, to Morningside as it was being developed eight years ago and now works for Bakker\'s TV show. <br />Some light reading: Bakker\'s website sells a $3,500 fuel-less generator kit (right) which uses solar power. It is perfect for powering up a lamp to read the $35 Trump prophesies book bundle <br />Dinner is served: The Fiesta Pail provides 196 servings of freeze-dried Mexican entrees such as burritos and enchiladas for the impending Apocalypse ($100). Food can be prepared with heat from a box of 24 fire starter disks for $59 <br />With Bakker\'s products, there is no need to resort to veganism after doomsday. His website hawks freeze dried beef chunks (13 servings, $70) and a cheese blend powder (43 servings, $30) <br />Pancakes with butter after Armageddon after the world ends? It\'s possible with Jim Bakker\'s pancake mix (3 buckets of blueberry mix with 253 servings, $195) and butter powder ($30)\'The Lord sent me here, it was a divine calling,\' he said. \'My children volunteer, this place is volunteer oriented. It\'s like a giant Mayberry. I can look around a room and tell you the life stories of everyone. We\'re a giant family.\'The security gatehouse - complete with tire-bursting spikes - seems to suggest that crime is a lot higher than the fictional Mayberry from the Andy Griffith Show.But the gatehouse, paid for by donations from Bakker show viewers, seems to be manned only when the evangelist and his family are on site. As a new book \'PTL: The Rise and Fall of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker\'s Evangelical Empire[1]\' reveals, Bakker was one of the biggest criminals of the late twentieth century.Author John Wigger, a history professor who has written previous books about Methodism in America, says the Ministry\'s odd initials stood for Praise the Lord or People That Love but cynics joked it meant Pass The Loot.Wigger lists some of their extraordinary spending sprees - $24,500 on furs and $27,500 on jewelry on one single Manhattan shopping trip and $170,000 on three antique cars in one day.  <br />The worst dish in the Italian Variety pack was the macaroni and cheese (front) which was bright orange and  tasted like cardboard  <br />Proceeds from the survival food kits go to support the Bakkers\' ministry. Jim served five years in prison for committing fraud in the late eighties and technically owns nothing <br />The Blue Eye store is stocked to the brim with food and camping supplies to help Bakker-followers survive the ApocalypseThe ministry paid for practically everything, including $100,000 to charter a private jet merely to collect some clothes from their North Carolina home.But it was a sex scandal that ultimately led to Bakker\'s downfall. Church secretary Jessica Hahn was just 21 when she accused Bakker of raping her in a Tampa, Florida hotel room.She claimed he pinned her down for an hour as he attacked her, repeatedly telling her: \'By helping the shepherd, you\'re helping the sheep.\'Rival preacher Jimmy Swaggart - later defrocked for his own sex scandal - discovered Hahn had been paid $279,000 by Bakker\'s ministry to keep quiet and tried to use that to get his hands on the PTL empire.Ultimately Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell took over the ministry - only to discover it was millions in debt and money raised for hotel time shares had been diverted elsewhere. Bakker\'s scandals made headlines around the world - the secret bisexual had been caught by a professional clown enjoying an orgy with three much younger men in a sauna, meanwhile Tammy Faye had taken to throwing herself sexually at the hired help and popping prescription pills by the handful.She was so out-of-it on one plane trip she attempted to open the door and, according to Wigger\'s book, sedating her took enough Valium to \'kill a truck driver.\'As the feds closed in, Tammy Faye was rushed into emergency detox, close to death. She initially stood by her errant husband when he was found guilty of conspiracy and 23 counts of wire and mail fraud in 1989 and sentenced to 45 years in prison. <br />Bakker was caught having a gay orgy in a sauna with three younger men. At the time his wife Tammy (pictured) was believed to have been throwing herself at men and popping pills <br />Bakker\'s current followers appear to have forgiven him for his scandalous past. He was accused of raping church secretary 21-year-old Jessica Hahn and then paying her to keep quiet But three years into his sentence, which was later reduced to eight years, Tammy Faye divorced him and married their close friend Roe Messner, who had ironically come up with the hush money to pay off Hahn, then billed the ministry for non-existent building work.Messner was later jailed for bankruptcy fraud and Tammy Faye reinvented herself as a reality TV star, self-help author and - after being described as \'the ultimate drag queen\'- an unlikely gay icon.Bakker ultimately served just five years in prison and was released on parole in 1994. After quietly working with a ministry in California, he married Lori and set about re-starting his old ministry.In fairness, Bakker does not shy away from his past, although he describes his encounter with Hahn on his website as \'a moral indiscretion.\'At last Thursday\'s show taping Bakker mentioned his time in prison six times, using it almost as a badge of honor to explain how God had started telling him the end of the world was nigh.Sounding close to tears, he warned the Apocalypse had already started, citing earthquakes in Yellowstone National Park and the rattling with North Korea.Possibly attempting some scaremongering ahead of next Monday\'s eclipse, he added: \'The sun and the moon will go dark and what will happen when the sun doesn\'t shine and nuclear winter takes place?\' <br />It was a sex scandal that ultimately led to Bakker\'s downfall. Church secretary Jessica Hahn was just 21 when she accused Bakker of raping her in a Tampa, Florida hotel room <br />Tucked away on the grounds are clusters of \'cozy cottages\' and dome-shaped homes also for sale or rental. At the end of one long drive sits a large wooden mansion, named after Lori, to house pregnant women who have fallen on hard timesHe left his audience hanging by a thread as he moved on to make another plea for money and hail his old pal President Trump and his visits to the White House.\'Lori and I were at the White House last week and the president is hungry to hear from the church,\' he said.\'One of the problems with the White House is they are saying there are too many preachers in the White House. The president doesn\'t think that. He found Christ watching the TV, by the way.\'He used that revelation to plug evangelist Paula White Cain, an upcoming guest on his show, who \'led\' Trump to Jesus 15 years ago. She would, he promised, reveal all the White House secrets.Arguably a large chunk of America considers the current president akin with the Antichrist. But it is fair to say, the vast majority of Bakker\'s followers are pro-Trump.Bakker clearly feared the worst when it looked like Hillary Clinton would win last year\'s election, describing her as \'a very wicked and un-Christian woman.

e23bc68827,What you should do if you\'re involved in a crash with a wild boar - Gloucestershire Live,"What you should do if you\'re involved in a crash with a wild boar<br />Since 2013 the number of cars crashing into wild boar has exceeded those who have hit deer in the Forest of Dean. But what do you do if you find yourself in a collision with one of the massive beasts while driving through the Forest? It\'s becoming increasingly common. Read More<br />Although they can be seen in the daytime, animals like this boar seen roaming across the road in Blakeney, usually come out after dark, which can make the experience even more distressing. <br />Wild boar<br />Read More<br />Luckily Gloucestershire Live reader Jason Williams spotted this giant pig in time but the number of accident is on the rise and police say if the animal is still in the road they treat it as an emergency because the obstruction can cause another crash. <br />A wild boar in Blakeney, Forest of Dean<br />(Image: Jason Williams)<br />Read More<br />They recommend calling 101 or 999 so officers can come out and make sure the road is safe for other drivers. In turn police call out the Forestry Commission who send a marksmen in case a badly injured animal has to be put down for compassionate reasons. <br />P<br />Wildlife centres are reluctant to treat injured boar because it is illegal to release the animals back into the wild and they can only be rehomed with somebody who has a licence to keep dangerous wild animals. Inspector Andrew Hodgetts said: \""Unlike some animals, there is no legal duty on the motorist to report an accident with a boar. Read More<br />\""But we treat is an emergency because we have a duty to protect other road users. It\'s not like hitting a pheasant. They are really big and one of our own sergeants had his car written off by a boar around 18 months ago. \""We are trained in driving skills but the boar are so dark it\'s difficult to see them and from what I understand, they can\'t see us coming either.\"" <br />A family of boar in the Forest of Dean<br />(Image: Adrian Worrall)<br />Insurers say persistent rumours that they do not pay out on boar claims are wrong. According to the Forest of Dean District Council, if you find a dead boar on the road or verge contact the Customer Services Team on 01594 810000 (Monday to Thursday 9.00am - 4.45pm & Friday 9.00am - 4.30pm). Ah, the glory days of cinemas - when Gloucester had ten of them[1] If the dead boar is situated in the statutory Forest contact the Forestry Commission on 03000 674800 (Monday to Friday 9.00am - 3.00pm). If the deceased boar is on private land contact the land owner or the Defra Helpline on 03459 33 55 77 (UK only) (Monday to Friday 8.30am - 5.00pm). To report an injured or distressed animal contact the Forestry Commission on 03000 674800 (Monday to Friday 9.00am - 3.00pm). In the event of an emergency contact the police on 101 or 999. The Forestry Commission there are 1,562 animals in the woodlands at present and if nothing is done this will carry on increasing year on year until the population stabilises at around 10,000. Last year around 492 were culled by marksmen or killed on the roads of the Forest of Dean.References^ Ah, the glory days of cinemas - when Gloucester had ten of them (www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEkESIgyboAONHzw5QJ_CMuTDIlMQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=WOXuWfi3CsmxzAasvrPwCA&url=http://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/what-you-should-youre-involved-669574,EN,,24/10/2017 07:01,2017-10-23 13:11:11+00:00,c1967ab863,Gloucestershire Live,,,,,1508771471,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Picture: Ian Burt. <br />Archant 2017 <br />A commitment to animal welfare and a dramatic reduction in the use of antibiotics have made a Norfolk pig farmer the best in the business, according to the fast-food chain he supplies. <br />Email this article to a friend <br />To send a link to this page you must be logged in. <br />Fakenham pig farmer Robert Battersby has been crowned McDonald\'s UK Outstanding Farmer of the Year 2017. Picture: Ian Burt.<br />Robert Battersby, who farms near Fakenham, said he was \""very proud\"" to be crowned McDonald\'s Outstanding Farmer of the Year 2017.<br />On 100 acres of rented land, Mr Battersby has 1,000 sows producing just over 26 pigs per sow, per year, which are reared for four weeks before being sent to straw-based RSPCA-assured finishing units across East Anglia.<br />Mr Battersby, who has supplied McDonald\'s for four years, was praised for his focus on pig health and welfare through the development of insulated farrowing huts, containerised clean water systems and environmental initiatives.<br />These measures have helped reduce the mortality rates of his piglets by 20pc and lowered antibiotic usage by 85% - a huge individual contribution to industry efforts to reduce the amount of drugs given to livestock, in a bid to halt the rise of drug-resistant infections in human medicine.<br />Fakenham pig farmer Robert Battersby has been crowned McDonald\'s UK Outstanding Farmer of the Year 2017. Picture: Ian Burt.<br />\""It is all about animal welfare,\"" said Mr Battersby. \""Outdoor pig farming is sometimes perceived as being cheap and cheerful with the equipment that we use. But with the amount of piglets that the sows are now producing we need to be looking at it in a different way. <br />\""We need to be spending more money on better quality equipment. It is all about the sow - their health and welfare is key. The happier they are, the better they do in terms of the piglets they produce.<br />\""We\'ve reduced our antibiotic use by 85pc over the last couple of years. It is a massive issue, and not just in the pig industry. Every industry needs to look at what they are doing and how they can reduce their use of antibiotics. There are no preventative antibiotics used here. They are only used to treat specific ailments like mastitis, lameness or cuts.\""<br />Measures to improve animal health - and therefore reduce the need for medicine - include investing in a system of more than 200 sealed plastic tanks which supply the whole farm with clean drinking water.<br />Fakenham pig farmer Robert Battersby has been crowned McDonald\'s UK Outstanding Farmer of the Year 2017. Picture: Ian Burt.<br />\""The water is 100pc containerised so there is no contamination from birds or rats, or from the sows themselves,\"" said Mr Battersby. \""There is silver mixed into the tank which stops bacteria re-growing, so as long as there is clean water going in, it will stay clean.<br />\""We are also providing a lot more green cover for the sows. It is very stony ground here so we used to get a lot of leg problems, which required a lot of antibiotics. Now we hardly get any leg problems because we cultivate the soil more and put more grass in.\""<br />ENGINEERING INNOVATION<br />Among the new innovations at Mr Battersby\'s farm are the twin-skinned plastic farrowing huts, which keep the pigs cool in the hot summer weather.<br />Fakenham pig farmer Robert Battersby has been crowned McDonald\'s UK Outstanding Farmer of the Year 2017. Picture: Ian Burt.<br />\""The old huts are metal so the temperature goes sky-high in summer,\"" he said. \""That is why we have been developing these plastic huts with an engineering company called Techneat in Littleport (near Ely).<br />\""Now we have these twin-skin Armadillo huts, which are filled with foam for insulation. In the summer, when the temperature is 30 degrees outside, you can get temperatures of up to 45 degrees in a metal hut, but with a plastic hut we can easily get 10 degrees lower, and that makes all the difference between the piglets being fed or not being fed at certain times of day. In a metal hut they would be out looking for some way to keep cool.<br />\""We have spent a lot of money - one plastic hut is £500 and we have 264 of the twin-skin models. But I always liked the point of view that I would not want to sit in a metal hut on a sunny day, so why would I make my pigs do it?\""<br />FUTURE PLANS<br />Fakenham Pig Farmer Robert Battersby\'s has been crowned McDonald\'s Outstanding Farmer of the Year 2017. Picture: Ian Burt<br />Mr Battersby said he aims to expand the farm by renting an additional 50 acres for another 500 sows.<br />\""We start building it in September,\"" he said. \""That unit will use everything we have learned here. <br />\""It will be 100pc plastic huts and water containers. And we will look at ways of keeping more grass in the fields, so that unit will be under-sown with clovers and different grasses so the whole site will be greener and better for the pigs.\""<br />The award was presented by McDonald\'s UK supply chain director Connor McVeigh, who said: \""Robert really impressed with his commitment to finding new solutions to long standing issues in pig production, and his innovative ideas are an example to farmers across the UK.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNF9GsIyzdrHud_-cjtQIbE7iUHSzA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=FfhyWYCyGcv_zAbU0ZeADg&url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/business/farming/fakenham-pig-farmer-is-crowned-mcdonald-s-outstanding-farmer-of-the-year-2017-1-5116368,EN,,22/07/2017 07:00,2017-07-21 07:29:54+00:00,42e448a51f,Norfolk Eastern Daily Press,,,,,1500629394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our lead candidates<br />poised for Phase 3 development are: (1) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to protect the gut microbiome from the effects<br />of certain commonly used intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics for the prevention of C. difficile infection (CDI), overgrowth<br />of pathogenic organisms and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and (2) SYN-010 which is intended to reduce the impact<br />of methane-producing organisms in the gut microbiome to treat an underlying cause of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation<br />(IBS-C). Our preclinical pursuits include an oral formulation of the enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) to treat both<br />local GI and systemic diseases as well as monoclonal antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of pertussis, and novel<br />discovery stage biotherapeutics for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). <br />Product Pipeline:<br /> <br />¹Designed to degrade excess antibiotic excreted into the<br />GI tract before the antibiotic reaches the colon and causes dysbiosis.<br />²For use in patients who can\'t swallow the capsule<br />or its contents.<br />³Designed to degrade non-absorbed<br />antibiotic remaining in the GI tract before the antibiotic reaches the colon and causes dysbiosis.<br />C - License and collaboration with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center<br />M - Scientific collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital <br />* Development of nasogastric tube (NG) dosing is based on guidance<br />and recommendations by physicians, surgeons, KOLs, our expert steering committee and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br />Summary of Clinical and Preclinical Programs<br />Therapeutic Area<br /> <br />ProductCandidate<br /> <br />Status <br

Intrexon and UT Austin<br />Our Microbiome-Focused Pipeline<br />Our SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-010 programs<br />are focused on protecting the healthy function of the gut microbiome, or gut flora, which is composed of billions of microbial<br />organisms including a natural balance of both \""good\"" beneficial species and potentially \""bad\"" pathogenic<br />species. When the natural balance or normal function of these microbial species is disrupted, a person\'s health can be compromised.<br />All of our programs are supported by our growing intellectual property portfolio. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio<br />through: filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent<br />applications. Our plan remains focused on the advancement of our two late-stage clinical programs. We continue to actively manage<br />resources in preparation for the advancement of our two late-stage microbiome-focused clinical programs, including our pursuit<br />of opportunities that will allow us to establish the clinical infrastructure and financial resources necessary to successfully<br />initiate and complete this plan.<br />SYN-004 (ribaxamase) - Prevention of<br />C. difficile infections (CDI), overgrowth by pathogenic organisms, and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)<br />SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is a proprietary<br />oral 75 mg capsule prophylactic therapy designed to degrade certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics excreted into the GI tract and<br />maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome to prevent CDI, reduce overgrowth of pathogenic organisms, and suppress the<br />emergence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Published clinical literature has also suggested that preventing microbiome damage<br />caused by IV beta-lactam antibiotics excreted into the GI tract may have potential therapeutic benefit as a means of preventing<br />acute graft-vs-host disease in hematopoietic cell transplant patients. SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is a beta-lactamase enzyme intended<br />to be administered as two-75 mg capsules which, when released in the proximal small intestine, can degrade beta-lactam antibiotics<br />in the GI tract without altering systemic antibiotic levels. Beta-lactam antibiotics are a mainstay in hospital infection management<br />and include the commonly used penicillin and cephalosporin classes of antibiotics.<br />In November 2012, we acquired a series<br />of oral beta-lactamase enzymes (P1A, P2A and P3A) and related assets targeting the prevention of CDI, the leading healthcare-associated<br />infection that generally occurs secondary to treatment with IV antibiotics from Prev ABR LLC. The acquired assets include a pre-Investigational<br />New Drug (IND) package for P3A, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data for P1A, manufacturing processes and data, and a portfolio of<br />issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents intended to support an IND and Biologics License Application (BLA) with the FDA. Utilizing<br />this portfolio of assets, we developed a proprietary, second generation oral beta-lactamase enzyme product candidate that we now<br />refer to as SYN-004 or by its generic name \""ribaxamase\"".<br />Compared to the first generation oral<br />enzyme candidate of P1A, we believe that the second generation candidate, SYN-004 (ribaxamase), will have activity against a broader<br />spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics, including both penicillins and certain cephalosporins. Due to the structural similarities<br />between P1A and SYN-004 (ribaxamase), and based on previous discussions with the FDA, certain preclinical data collected on P1A<br />was used in support of an IND application for SYN-004 (ribaxamase).<br />Specifically, P1A had been evaluated in<br />four Phase 1 and one Phase 2 clinical trials conducted in Europe. In total, 112 patients and 143 healthy volunteers participated<br />in these studies.<br />C. difficile<br />C. difficile is the leading type<br />of hospital acquired infection and is frequently associated with IV beta-lactam antibiotic treatment. According to a paper published<br />in BMC Infectious Diseases (Desai K et al. BMC Infect Dis. 2016; 16: 303) the economic cost of CDI was approximately $5.4 billion<br />in 2016 ($4.7 billion in healthcare settings; $725 million in the community) in the U.S., mostly due to hospitalizations. CDI<br />is a rising global hospital acquired infection (HAI) problem in which the toxins produced by C. difficile bacteria result<br />in C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD), and in the most serious cases, pseudomembranous colitis (severe inflammation<br />of the lower GI tract) that can lead to death. The CDC identified C. difficile as an \""urgent public health threat,\""<br />particularly given its resistance to many drugs used to treat other infections. CDI is a major unintended risk associated with<br />the prophylactic or therapeutic use of IV antibiotics, which may alter the natural balance of microflora that normally protect<br />the GI tract, leading to C. difficile overgrowth and infection. Other risk factors for CDI include hospitalization, prolonged<br />length of stay (estimated at 7 days), underlying illness, and immune-compromising conditions including the administration of chemotherapy<br />and advanced age. In addition, approximately 20% of patients who have been diagnosed with CDI experience a recurrence of CDI within<br />one to three months.<br />Limitations of Current Treatments and<br />Market Opportunity<br />CDI is a widespread and often drug resistant<br />infectious disease. According to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Leffler DA et al. N Engl J Med 2015;<br />372:1539-1548), it is estimated that 453,000 patients are infected with C. difficile annually in the U.S., and it has been<br />reported that approximately 29,000 patients die due to CDI-associated complications each year. Controlling the spread of CDI has<br />proven challenging, as the C. difficile spores are easily transferred to patients via normal contact with healthcare personnel<br />and with inanimate objects. There is currently no vaccine or approved product for the prevention of primary (incident) CDI.<br />According to IMS Health Incorporated,*<br />in 2016, 227 million doses of SYN-004 (ribaxamase)-addressable intravenous Penicillin and Cephalosporin antibiotics were administered<br />in the United States which may contribute to the onset of CDI. Additional data derived from IMS Health Incorporated states that<br />in 2016, the worldwide market for SYN-004 (ribaxamase)-addressable intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics was approximately 7.5 billion<br />doses, which may represent a multi-billion dollar opportunity for us. According to the CDC report Antibiotic Resistance<br />Threats in the United States, 2013, at least 2 million people in the U.S. each year acquire serious infections with bacteria<br />that are resistant to one or more of the antibiotics designed to treat those infections, which results in an estimated $20 billion<br />in excess direct healthcare costs.<br />*<br />This information is an estimate derived from the use of information<br />under license from the following IMS Health Incorporated information service: IMS Health Analytics for the full year 2016.<br />IMS expressly reserves all rights, including rights of copying, distribution, and republication.<br />Clinical Update<br />On April 23, 2018, we announced that we<br />had reached preliminary agreement with the FDA on key elements of a proposed clinical trial program for our planned Phase 3 clinical<br />trial for ribaxamase. In accordance with recommendations and guidance received from the FDA, we expect the Phase 3 trial to evaluate<br />the efficacy and safety of ribaxamase as separate, co-primary endpoints in a patient population being treated with a representative<br />selection of intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics, which will include ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam. The inclusion<br />of more than one beta-lactam antibiotic in this trial is intended to evaluate the potential utility of ribaxamase for co-administration<br />with a greater number of cephalosporin and penicillin beta-lactam antibiotics. The proposed Phase 3 clinical trial discussed with<br />the FDA will comprise a global, event-driven clinical trial with a fixed maximum number of patients and will seek to evaluate<br />the efficacy and safety of ribaxamase in a broader patient population by enrolling patients with a variety of underlying infections.<br />We expect the primary efficacy endpoint of the proposed Phase 3 trial will be the reduction in the incidence of CDI in the ribaxamase<br />treatment group compared to placebo. We have also reached preliminary agreement with the FDA to evaluate mortality risk as the<br />primary safety endpoint for this trial, which will be separate from the primary efficacy endpoint of reduction of the incidence<br />of CDI. The designation of efficacy and safety as separate and decoupled endpoints is critical for clinical studies of this nature,<br />where the underlying population is projected to have a comparatively high incidence of safety events that may significantly dilute<br />the smaller number of CDI events.<br />We plan to continue collaborative discussions<br />with the FDA to solidify the remaining details of the proposed Phase 3 clinical trial program during an anticipated End of Phase<br />2 meeting with the FDA in the third quarter of 2018. In parallel with clinical and regulatory efforts, we have recently completed<br />a Health Economics Outcomes Research study, which was conducted to generate key insights on how we can expect Health Care Practitioners,<br />or HCPs, to evaluate patient access for ribaxamase while also providing a framework for potential reimbursement strategies. After<br />evaluating findings from the study, and after extensive discussions with pharmaceutical companies, physicians, research institutions<br />and clinical development groups worldwide, we believe that there is significant potential value in exploring the development of<br />SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in a more narrow patient population where the incidence of the disease endpoint is high and the clinical<br />development may be less costly. One potential narrow patient population for SYN-004 could be allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant<br />(HCT) recipients, who have a very high risk of CDI, VRE colonization and potentially fatal bacteremia, and acute-graft-vs-host<br />disease. Published literature has demonstrated a strong association between these adverse outcomes and microbiome damage caused<br />by IV beta-lactam antibiotics in these patients. Further examination and discussions with key opinion leaders (KOLs) who are experts<br />in allogenic HCT are ongoing to evaluate a potential clinical development pathway forward for SYN-004 in such a narrow, specialty<br />patient population.<br />Contingent on potential interest from<br />prospective partners and/or appropriate funding, we anticipate initiating the Phase 3 clinical trial currently under discussion<br />with the FDA in 2H 2019 which will evaluate SYN-004 (ribaxamase) effects on CDI in a broad and diverse patient population. In<br />parallel, discussions with KOLs are ongoing to determine if further investigation in the form of a potential Phase 1 and/or Phase<br />2 clinical trial(s) evaluating SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in a specialized patient population such as allogenic HCT patients may also<br />and/or alternatively be pursued in 2H 2019. If it is determined that the clinical advancement of SYN-004 is more favorable and<br />significantly less costly in a specialized patient population, we may elect to prioritize and pursue this strategy in advance<br />of pursuing the broader, Phase 3 clinical program currently under discussion with the FDA. If approved by the FDA, SYN-004 (ribaxamase)<br />would be the first available drug designed to prevent primary Clostridium difficile infection by protecting the gut microbiome<br />from antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis.<br />SYN-010 - Treatment of Irritable Bowel<br />Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)<br />SYN-010 is our proprietary, modified-release<br />formulation of lovastatin lactone that is intended to reduce methane production by certain microorganisms (M. smithii)<br />in the gut while minimizing disruption to the microbiome. Methane produced by M. smithii is an underlying cause of pain,<br />bloating and constipation associated with IBS-C, and published reports have associated higher intestinal methane production with<br />increased constipation severity in IBS-C patients. SYN-010 is intended to act primarily in the intestinal lumen while avoiding<br />systemic absorption, thereby targeting the major cause of IBS-C, not just the patient\'s symptoms.<br />In December 2013, through our subsidiary<br />Synthetic Biomics, Inc.

SMC) and acquired the rights to develop products for therapeutic and prophylactic treatments of acute and chronic diseases,<br />including the development of SYN-010 to target IBS-C. We licensed from CSMC a portfolio of intellectual property comprised of<br />several U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications for various fields of use, including IBS-C, obesity and diabetes.<br />An investigational team, led by Mark Pimentel, M.D. at CSMC, discovered that these products may reduce the production of methane<br />gas by certain GI microorganisms.<br />We believe SYN-010 may reduce the impact<br />of methane producing organisms on IBS-C.<br />Irritable Bowel Syndrome<br />IBS is a functional GI disorder characterized<br />by gas, abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea or constipation, or alternating episodes of both. The illness affects both men and<br />women; however, two-thirds of diagnosed sufferers are women. The onset of IBS can begin anytime from adolescence to adulthood.<br />Four bowel patterns may be seen with IBS including: IBS-C (constipation predominant), IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), IBS-M (mixed<br />diarrhea and constipation) and IBS-U (unsubtyped). According to GlobalData\'s IBS - Global Drug Forecast and Market<br />Analysis to 2023 (December 2014 ), the prevalence of IBS in adults in the United States, Europe and Japan was expected to<br />be 41.1 million in 2016, and it has been reported that up to 20 percent of all IBS patients have IBS-C. Extensive studies conducted<br />by Dr. Pimentel and collaborators have shown that overproduction of methane gas is directly associated with bloating, pain and<br />constipation in IBS-C patients. Investigators at CSMC have discovered that inhibiting intestinal methane production may reverse<br />constipation associated with IBS-C, and may be beneficial in treating other major diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance<br />and type 2 diabetes.<br />Limitations of Current Treatments and<br />Market Opportunity<br />Currently, the FDA approved therapies<br />for the treatment of IBS-C include prescription and over-the-counter laxatives, which provide patients with temporary symptomatic<br />relief and often cause diarrhea, but are not designed to and do not treat the underlying cause of pain, bloating and constipation<br />associated with IBS-C. Additionally, these same therapies may come with undesirable safety side-effect profiles, the most common<br />of which is diarrhea. As a result, these therapies have struggled to find adoption in several key markets, including Europe. We<br />believe this presents an important opportunity for SYN-010. Towards the end of 2017, we engaged outside consultants to evaluate<br />the potential regulatory pathway towards EMA marketing approval. According to IMS Health Analytics, U.S. sales in 2016 for IBS-C<br />and Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) therapeutics as well as OTC laxatives/products were approximately $2.5 billion, representing<br />a constant annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% from 2012.<br />Clinical Update <br />On September 5,2018," we entered into<br />an agreement with CSMC for an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical study of SYN-010 to be co-funded by us and CSMC (the \""""Study\"""").<br />The Study will provide further evaluation<br />of the efficacy and safety of SYN-010", our modified-release reformulation of lovastatin lactone, which is exclusively licensed<br />to us by CSMC. SYN-010 is designed to reduce methane production by certain microorganisms (M. smithii) in the gut to treat<br />an underlying cause of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). The data from this study will provide additional insights<br />into potential SYN-010 clinical efficacy, including dose response and microbiome effects, ideally solidifying existing clinical<br />outcomes data, and potentially simplifying Phase 3 clinical development.<br />The Study will be conducted out of the<br />Pimentel Laboratory at CSMC and is expected to be a 12-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial to evaluate<br />two dose strengths of oral SYN-010 (21 mg and 42 mg) in approximately 150 patients diagnosed with IBS-C. The investigator-sponsored<br />Study will be led by the gastrointestinal microbiota researcher Ruchi Mathur, M.D., director of Metabolism, Clinical Research<br />and Administrative Operations at the Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program at CSMC. The Study is expected<br />to begin enrollment during the fourth quarter of 2018, contingent upon approval of the clinical study protocol by the CSMC Institutional<br />Review Board.<br />The primary objective for the Study will<br />be to determine the efficacy of SYN-010, measured as an improvement from baseline in the weekly average number of complete spontaneous<br />bowel movements (CSBMs) during the 12-week treatment period for SYN-010 21 mg and 42 mg daily doses relative to placebo. Secondary<br />efficacy endpoints for both dose strengths of SYN-010 are expected to measure changes from baseline in abdominal pain, bloating,<br />stool frequency as well as the use of rescue medication relative to placebo. Exploratory outcomes include Adequate Relief and<br />quality of life measures using the well-validated EQ-5D-5L and PAC-SYM patient questionnaires.<br />We expect that CSMC will dose the first<br />patient in the investigator-sponsored Phase 2b clinical study in Q4 2018. A data readout from this clinical trial study is anticipated<br />in 2H 2019.<br />Allowance of Key U.S. Patent<br />On May 1,2018, the United States Patent<br />and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued U.S. Patent No. 9,956,292 which includes claims related to composition of matter for the use<br />of anti-methanogenic compositions to treat IBS-C. The patent will provide key intellectual property protection in the U.S. for<br />SYN-010 and will expire no later than 2035.<br />Research Programs<br />Infectious disease outbreaks are increasing<br />while intervention options are declining due to widespread multidrug-resistant bacteria, increasing numbers of immuno-compromised<br />patients (e.g., the elderly and cancer patients) and the isolation of new pathogens.<br />SYN-007 - Prevention<br />of CDI, overgrowth of pathogenic organisms and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)<br />SYN-007 is a specially formulated version<br />of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) designed to degrade orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics to protect the gut microbiome from antibiotic-mediated<br />dysbiosis. SYN-007 is formulated for release in the distal small intestine to allow systemic absorption of the oral antibiotic<br />while still providing protection upstream of the colon and to the gut microbiome. SYN-007 is designed for patients who have been<br />administered SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in combination with intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics and who are then transferred to an oral<br />beta-lactam antibiotic, thereby extending gut microbiome protection from antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis. Data from a recent canine<br />study completed during the second half of 2017 demonstrated that, when co-administered with oral amoxicillin, oral SYN-007 did<br />not interfere with amoxicillin absorption and did demonstrate protection of the gut microbiome. The data from this canine study<br />were presented during recent microbiome conferences in Q4 2017 and Q1 2018. A second canine study was completed during Q2 2018<br />in which oral SYN-007 was co-administered with oral amoxicillin and oral Augmentin. Again, SYN-007 did not interfere with systemic<br />absorption of the antibiotics but did diminish the microbiome damage associated with these antibiotics.<br /> SYN-006 - Prevention<br />of CDI, overgrowth of pathogenic organisms and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)<br />The second pipeline product, termed SYN-006,<br />has the potential to further expand the utility of our SYN-004 (ribaxamase) program to a broader spectrum of IV beta-lactam antibiotics<br />in the GI tract to include carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenems are broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics that have been shown<br />to significantly damage the gut microbiome, incur a high risk for C. difficile infection, and enable GI overgrowth with<br />multidrug resistant organisms. Carbapenems are frequently a last line of defense antibiotic, therefore the emergence and spread<br />of carbapenem resistance presents an urgent threat. SYN-006 is a carbapenemase designed to degrade intravenous (IV) carbapenem<br />antibiotics within the GI tract to maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome for the prevention of CDI, overgrowth of<br />pathogenic organisms and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It is anticipated that, by protecting the gut microbiome<br />from exposure to carbapenem antibiotics, SYN-006 may potentially diminish the spread of such resistance. At the ID Week 2017 conference,<br />we presented a poster demonstrating SYN-006\'s broad activity against four carbapenem antibiotics as well as efficacy in<br />a canine model. The poster also showed data from a porcine model indicating that the carbapenem, ertapenem, potently damaged gut<br />microbiomes and mediated expansion of antibiotic resistance genes in the GI tract. More recently, we successfully formulated SYN-006<br />for oral delivery and evaluated it in a porcine efficacy model in conjunction with IV ertapenem. The data, presented at a clinical<br />conference during the first quarter of 2018, demonstrated that SYN-006 did not interfere with serum levels of ertapenem and did<br />diminish antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis.<br />SYN-005 - Pertussis<br />(Whooping Cough)<br />The SYN-005 program is developing monoclonal<br />antibodies both as a prophylaxis and a treatment for pertussis. Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) is a gram-negative<br />bacterium that infects the upper respiratory tract, causing uncontrollable and violent coughing. Antibiotic treatment does not<br />have a major effect on the course of pertussis. While such treatment can eliminate the B. pertussis bacteria from the respiratory<br />tract, it does not neutralize the pertussis toxin. Infants with pertussis often require hospitalization in pediatric intensive<br />care units, frequently requiring mechanical ventilation. The incidence of pertussis is increasing due to the declining effectiveness<br />of the acellular vaccine introduced in the 1990s, exposure of unvaccinated and under-vaccinated individuals including infants<br />who are not yet fully vaccinated and exposure of individuals whose immunity has diminished over time.<br />According to the Centers<br />for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , there were 24.1 million cases of whooping cough worldwide in 2014, and it is estimated<br />that B. pertussis infection caused up to 167,700 deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2014.<br />Intrexon Collaboration and The University<br />of Texas at Austin Agreement<br />In August 2012, we entered into a worldwide<br />exclusive channel collaboration with Intrexon develop monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies for the treatment of certain infectious<br />diseases not adequately addressed by existing therapies. In December 2012, we initiated mAb development for the prevention and<br />treatment of pertussis focusing on toxin neutralization. Unlike antibiotics, we are developing a mAb therapy to target and neutralize<br />the pertussis toxin as a prophylaxis for high-risk newborns and in order to shorten the course, diminish the long-term complications,<br />and reduce the mortality rate in infected infants.<br />To further the development of this potential<br />therapy for pertussis, we entered into an agreement with UT Austin to license the rights to certain research and pending patents<br />related to pertussis antibodies. These research efforts are being conducted at the Cockrell School of Engineering in the laboratory<br />of Associate Professor, Jennifer A. Maynard, Ph.D., the Laurence E. McMakin, Jr. Centennial Faculty Fellow in the McKetta Department<br />of Chemical Engineering. Dr. Maynard brings to the project her expertise in defining the key neutralizing epitopes of pertussis<br />toxin to optimize the potential efficacy of antibody therapeutics.<br />Preclinical Development  <br />Working with our collaborator, Intrexon,<br />and our academic collaborator, UT Austin, we have established a humanized mAb product candidate, SYN-005, designed to neutralize<br />pertussis toxin, a major cause of pertussis-mediated infant morbidity and mortality. The two humanized mAbs, hu1B7 and hu11E6,<br />bound tightly to the toxin and potently neutralized the toxin. In addition, the antibodies, individually or in combination, were<br />highly efficacious in a murine model of pertussis in which they completely mitigated elevations of the white blood cell count<br />that is characteristic of the illness.<br />In April 2014, and again in September<br />2014, we received positive preclinical research findings of SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis in three non-human primate<br />studies (n = 19). In the latter two pertussis studies in particular, SYN-005 rapidly stopped the rise in white blood cell count<br />that is characteristic of the disease and accelerated its return to baseline.<br />In September 2014, we received U.S. Orphan<br />Drug Designation from the FDA for SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis.<br />In October 2015, the Bill & Melinda<br />Gates Foundation awarded a grant to UT Austin to generate preclinical proof-of-concept data in the neonatal non-human primate<br />model to test the hypothesis that antibody administration at birth may have a role in the prevention of pertussis.<br />In December 2015, the non-human primate<br />prophylaxis study was initiated by UT Austin to determine if administration of hu1B7, one component of SYN-005, at two days of<br />age could protect animals from a subsequent pertussis infection. On April 19,2017, we announced supportive preclinical data demonstrating<br />hu1B7 provided five weeks of protection from pertussis in neonatal non-human primates. Control animals (n=6), infected with Bordetella<br />pertussis (B. pertussis) at five weeks of age, demonstrated marked elevations in white blood cell counts and most exhibited<br />behavioral signs of pertussis, including coughing and diminished activity. In contrast, the experimental animals (n=7), who were<br />treated with hu1B7 at two days of age and then infected five weeks later, had significantly lower peak white blood cell counts<br />(p=0.004) that remained within the normal range or were only slightly elevated. Importantly, all seven of the animals that received<br />prophylactic hu1B7 appeared healthy and none exhibited any behavioral signs of pertussis. Building on this early success, we performed<br />preclinical testing of a modified version of hu1B7 that has the potential to extend the plasma half-life. The modified hu1B7 achieved<br />higher plasma levels at five weeks than the parental hu1B7 antibody and was efficacious in preventing clinical pertussis. The<br />extended half-life antibody has the potential to substantially reduce the required dose and cost for prophylaxis for application<br />in the Developing World. This current study expands the potential clinical utility beyond treatment to also include prophylaxis.<br />SYN-020 - Oral Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase<br />SYN-020 is in the preclinical development<br />stage. SYN-020 is being developed as a modified-release oral dosage form of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP). IAP is an endogenous<br />enzyme expressed in the upper GI tract that functions as a broadly acting phosphatase that generally serves to maintain GI homeostasis<br />and promote commensal microbiota. In animal models, IAP is anti-inflammatory," tightens the gut barrier to diminish \""""leaky<br />gut","\"""" and accelerates gut microbiome recovery from antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis. Published reports have demonstrated efficacy<br />for several indications with oral IAP in many animal models including colitis", antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis, and metabolic syndrome<br />as well as in a pilot human clinical trial with ulcerative colitis patients.<br />Limitations of Current Treatments and<br />Clinical Update <br />Despite its therapeutic potential, clinical<br />application of an oral IAP product has been hindered by inefficient manufacturing with a high cost of goods. We have established<br />manufacturing processes with the potential to yield product with a cost of goods which we believe to be suitable for commercialization.<br />Recent advances include cell lines that express up to 3 grams/L along with a chromatographic downstream process and potential<br />tablet formulations. We are currently optimizing these technologies and pursuing animal efficacy studies. During Q2 2018, we completed<br />several preclinical animal studies that support the clinical utility of SYN-020 for multiple gastrointestinal disorders. We are<br />currently evaluating and establishing strategies to advance IAP to and through clinical trials for several novel indications,<br />including enterocolitis associated with radiation therapy for cancer and checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer and microscopic<br />colitis, all of which have unmet medical needs and span a range of market sizes. Importantly, we believe that with a small capital<br />commitment, we can begin moving SYN-020 towards an IND. We are targeting filing an IND during Q4 2019 and commencing a Phase 1<br />clinical trial during Q1 2020.<br />SYN-200 - Treatment<br />of Phenylketonuria (PKU)<br />PKU is a genetic disease that begins at<br />birth characterized by a deficiency in the liver enzyme that breaks down the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), a building<br />block of proteins normally obtained through the foods we eat. As a result, Phe accumulates in the body, becoming toxic and leading<br />to serious health consequences, including profound mental retardation, brain damage, mental illness, behavioral problems, seizures,<br />tremors, limited cognitive ability and hyperactivity. If left untreated, the most severe form of PKU leads to permanent cognitive<br />damage. PKU affects more than 14,000 people in the U.S. and 50,000 people in developed nations globally. There is no existing<br />cure for PKU, requiring patients to maintain a life-long treatment program and a carefully controlled diet.<br />Intrexon Collaboration<br />In August 2015, we initiated the SYN-200<br />discovery program for development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for the treatment of patients with PKU pursuant<br />to an exclusive channel collaboration with Intrexon. We intend to utilize Intrexon\'s ActoBiotics platform to provide<br />a proprietary method of delivering therapeutic protein to the GI tract through food-grade microbes. This program is in the discovery<br />stage.<br />Company History<br />Our predecessor, Sheffield Pharmaceuticals,<br />Inc., was incorporated in 1986, and in 2006 engaged in a reverse merger with Pipex Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation<br />formed in 2001. After the merger, we changed our name to Pipex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and in October 2008 we changed our name<br />to Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On October 15,2009, we engaged in a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of<br />reincorporating in the State of Nevada. After reprioritizing our focus on the emerging area of synthetic biologics and entering<br />into our first collaboration with Intrexon, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Synthetic Biologics,<br />Inc. on February 15, 2012.<br />Corporate Information<br />Our executive offices are located at 9605<br />Medical Center Drive, Suite 270, Rockville, Maryland 20850.

Each Class A Unit will consist of one share of our common stock and a warrant<br />to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price equal to 120% of the public offering price of the Class A Unit,<br />or $1.38 per share. The Class A Units will not be certificated and the shares of common stock and warrant that are part of such<br />unit will be immediately separable and will be issued separately in this offering. Assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option<br />and we sell 2,520,000 Class A Units (and 15,723 Class B Units) at the public offering price of $1.15<br />per Class A Unit and $1,000 per Class B Unit, we would issue in this offering an aggregate of 2,520,000 shares of our common stock<br />and warrants to purchase 16,192,173 shares of our common stock. The actual offering price per each Class A Unit was negotiated<br />between us and the underwriters based on the trading of our common stock prior to the offering, among other things, and was<br />at a discount to the market price. We are also offering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants sold<br />in Class A Units.<br /> <br />  Public Offering PricePer Class A Unit<br />$1.15 per Class A Unit.<br /> <br /> Class B Units offered by us <br />15,723 Class B Units. We are also offering to each purchaser whose purchase of Class A Units in this offering<br />would otherwise result in the purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than<br />4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%) of our outstanding common stock immediately following the consummation of this<br />offering, the opportunity to purchase, if the purchaser so chooses, Class B Units, in lieu of Class A Units.  Each Class<br />B Unit will consist of one share of our Series B Preferred, with a stated value of $1,000 and convertible into shares of our common<br />stock, at the public offering price of the Class A Units, together with an equivalent number of warrants as would have been issued<br />to such purchaser if they had purchased Class A Units based on the public offering price of the Class A Units. The Series B Preferred<br />do not generally have any voting rights but are convertible into shares of common stock.  The Class B Units will not<br />be certificated and the shares of Series B Preferred and warrants that are part of such unit will be immediately separable and<br />will be issued separately in this offering.  We are also offering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of<br />warrants sold in Class B Units and upon conversion of the Series B Preferred. For each Class B Unit we sell, the number of Class<br />A Units we are offering will be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Because we will issue a warrant as part of each Unit, the<br />number of warrants sold in this offering will not change as a result of a change in the mix of the Units sold.<br /> <br /> Public Offering Price PerClass B Unit<br />$1,000 per Class B Unit.<br /> <br /> Warrants offered by us<br />Each warrant included in the Units will have an exercise price of 120% of the public offering price of<br />the Class A Units, or $1.38 per share, will be exercisable upon issuance and will expire five years from the date of issuance.<br />Each warrant will be exercisable to purchase one share of our common stock.  No fractional shares of common stock will<br />be issued in connection with the exercise of a warrant. In lieu of fractional shares, we will round up to the next whole share.<br />The warrants also provide that in the event of a fundamental transaction we are required to cause any successor entity to assume<br />our obligations under the warrants. In addition, the holder of the warrant will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the warrant<br />the kind and amount of securities, cash or property that the holder would have received had the holder exercised the warrant immediately<br />prior to such fundamental transaction. This prospectus also relates to the offering of the shares of common stock issuable upon<br />exercise of the warrants. Subject to certain exceptions, the warrants provide for adjustment of the exercise price, which initially<br />will be 120% of the public offering price of the Class A Units, or $1.38 per share, if we or any of our subsidiaries, as applicable,<br />sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose of or issue (or announce any offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase<br />or other disposition) any shares of our common stock or common stock equivalents, at an effective price per share that is less<br />than the exercise price then in effect (such lower price," the \""""Base Share Price\"""" and such issuances collectively"," a<br />\""""Dilutive Issuance\""""). In the event a Dilutive Issuance occurs", the exercise price shall be reduced to equal the Base<br />Share Price.<br />Over-allotment option<br />We have granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,428,825 additional shares of<br />common stock at a price of $1.15 per share and/or additional warrants to purchase up to an additional 2,248,825 shares<br />of our common stock from us at a price of $0.01 per warrant, to cover over-allotments, if any, of the shares of common stock, shares<br />of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred and warrants comprising the Units.<br /> <br /> Common stock to be outstanding after the offering<br />23,400,493 shares of our common stock and assumes that all shares of Series B Preferred are converted<br />to shares of common stock and that none of the warrants are exercised. If the underwriters\' over-allotment option is exercised<br />in full, the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after this offering would be 25,829,318 assuming<br />all shares of Series B Preferred sold in this offering convert to common stock and that none of the warrants are exercised. This<br />prospectus also includes the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred and exercise of the<br />warrants.<br /> <br /> Series B Convertible Preferred Stock<br />The Series B Preferred will be convertible into shares of our<br />common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the related certificate of designation of preferences, rights and limitations)<br />at any time at the option of the holder," at a conversion price equal to the public offering price of the Class A Units.

There<br />is no established trading market for the Series B Preferred or warrants and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition",<br />we do not intend to apply for the listing of the Series B Preferred or warrants on any national securities exchange or other<br />trading market. Without an active trading market, the liquidity of the Series B Preferred and warrants will be limited.<br />The number of shares of common stock shown<br />above to be outstanding after this offering is based on 7,208,320 shares outstanding as of October 10,2018, and assumes the issuance<br />and sale of 2,520,000 Class A Units in this offering,15,723 Class B Units and that all Class B Units convert to an aggregate of<br />13,672,173 shares of common stock.<br />Unless we indicate otherwise, all information in this prospectus<br />is as of October 10, 2018 and:<br />·reflects<br />a one-for-thirty-five reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common<br />stock, options and warrants effected on August 10, 2018 and the corresponding adjustment<br />of all common stock prices per share and stock option and warrant exercise prices per<br />share and preferred stock conversion ratios without taking into account fractional<br />shares which are rounded up to the nearest whole number;·assumes<br />no exercise by the underwriters<br />of their over-allotment option; ·excludes<br />634,921 shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding shares of<br />preferred stock;·excludes 347,765<br />shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under our equity<br />incentive plans at a weighted-average exercise price of $54.19 per share;·excludes<br />915,854 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding<br />warrants with a weighted-average exercise price of $75.16 per share and assumes no exercise<br />of the warrants issued in this offering;·assumes all shares of Series B Preferred sold in this offering convert to shares of common stock; and<br />·excludes 170,674<br />shares of our common stock that are reserved for equity awards that may be granted under<br />our equity incentive plans.<br />To the extent we sell any Class B Units<br />in this offering, the same aggregate number of common stock equivalents resulting from this offering would be convertible under<br />the Series B Preferred issued as part of the Class B Units.<br />RISK FACTORS<br />An investment in our securities involves<br />a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other<br />information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the<br />related notes, before making a decision to invest in our securities. You should also consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions<br />discussed under Item 1A," \""""Risk Factors","\"""" in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31",<br />2017 and Item 1A," \""""Risk Factors","\"""" in Part II of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30", 2018<br />and any updates or other risks contained in other filings that we may make with the SEC after the date of this prospectus, all<br />of which are incorporated herein by reference, and may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports<br />we file with the SEC in the future and any additional prospectus supplement. If any of these risks actually occur, our business,<br />results of operations and financial condition could suffer. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline,<br />and you may lose all or part of your investment.<br />RISKS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING<br />Investors will experience immediate<br />and substantial dilution in the book value per share of the securities purchased in this offering.<br />Investors purchasing securities in this<br />offering will incur immediate and substantial dilution in net tangible book value per share of our common stock. After giving effect<br />to the sale of 2,520,000 Class A Units, at the public offering price of $1.15 per Class A Unit, and 15,723 Class B Units, assuming<br />that all Class B Units are converted into 13,672,173 shares of common stock, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount<br />and estimated offering expenses payable by us, purchasers of our Class A units in this offering will incur an increase<br />of $0.23 per share in the net tangible book value of the common stock they acquire. For a further description of the dilution that<br />investors in this offering will experience," see \""""Dilution\"""".<br />In addition", to the extent that outstanding<br />stock options or warrants or preferred stock (including the exercise of any warrants) have been or may be exercised or converted<br />or other shares issued, you may experience further dilution.<br />Our management will have broad discretion<br />over the use of proceeds from this offering and may not use the proceeds effectively.<br />Our management will have broad discretion<br />over the use of proceeds from this offering. The net proceeds from this offering will be used to fund our and our subsidiaries\'<br />preclinical and clinical programs (including, but not limited to, provide approximately $5.0-$7.0 in funding for manufacturing<br />scale-up activities to progress SYN-004 towards a potential Phase 3 (broad indication) clinical trial and/or initiate a Phase1/2<br />clinical trial(s) in a specialty population, approximately $7.5 million in funding for preclinical development and related manufacturing<br />activities in preparation for our IND and Phase 1 clinical trial for our SYN-020 program and required milestone payments) and<br />for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, to acquire, license or invest in complementary businesses, technologies,<br />product candidates or other intellectual property. Our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the<br />net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being<br />used appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not improve our operating results or enhance the<br />value of our common stock.<br />Even if this offering is successful,<br />we will need to raise additional capital in the future to continue operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms,<br />or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development<br />efforts or other operations.<br />We have had recurring losses from operations,<br />negative operating cash flow and an accumulated deficit. We do not generate any cash from operations and must raise additional<br />funds in order to continue operating our business. We expect to continue to fund our operations primarily through equity and debt<br />financings in the future. Our cash requirements may vary from those now planned depending upon numerous factors, including the<br />result of future research and development activities. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities,<br />particularly as we continue research and development activities and initiate and conduct clinical trials of, and seek marketing<br />approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect<br />to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We expect<br />that our existing cash together with the proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements<br />for the next twelve months. We will, however, require additional financing in order to complete our planned Phase 3 clinical trial<br />for SYN-004 and/or our planned Phase 2b/3 clinical trial for SYN-010. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional<br />funding in connection with our continuing operations. There are no other commitments by any person for future financing. Our securities<br />may be offered to other investors at a price lower than the price per share offered to current stockholders, or upon terms which<br />may be deemed more favorable than those offered to current stockholders. In addition, the issuance of securities in any future<br />financing may dilute an investor\'s equity ownership and have the effect of depressing the market price for our securities. Moreover,<br />we may issue derivative securities, including options and/or warrants, from time to time, to procure qualified personnel or for<br />other business reasons. The issuance of any such derivative securities, which is at the discretion of our board of directors,<br />may further dilute the equity ownership of our stockholders. No assurance can be given as to our ability to procure additional<br />financing, if required, and on terms deemed favorable to us. To the extent additional capital is required and cannot be raised<br />successfully, we may then have to limit our then current operations and/or may have to curtail certain, if not all, of our business<br />objectives and plans.<br />There is no established market for<br />the Series B Preferred or warrants being offered in this offering.<br />There is no established trading market<br />for the Series B Preferred or warrants and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply for the<br />listing of the Series B Preferred or warrants on any national securities exchange or other trading market. Without an active trading<br />market, the liquidity of the Series B Preferred or warrants will be limited.<br />Holders of Series B Preferred will<br />have limited voting rights.<br />Except with respect to certain material<br />changes in the terms of the Series B Preferred and certain other matters and except as may be required by Nevada law, holders<br />of Series B Preferred will have no voting rights. Holders of Series B Preferred will have no right to vote for any members of<br />our board of directors.<br />The warrants are speculative and<br />holders of the warrants will not have rights of common stockholders until such warrants are exercised.<br />The warrants being offered do not<br />confer any rights of common stock ownership on their holders, such as voting rights or the right to receive dividends, but<br />rather merely represent the right to acquire shares of common stock at a fixed price for a limited period of time.<br />Specifically, commencing on the date of issuance, holders of the warrants may exercise their right to acquire the common<br />stock and pay an exercise price per share equal to 120% of the public offering price, or $1.38 prior to five years from the<br />date of issuance, after which date any unexercised warrants will expire and have no further value. Moreover, there can also<br />be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the warrants, and<br />consequently, whether it will ever be profitable for holders of the warrants to exercise the warrants.<br />The proceeds received from the exercise<br />of the warrants issued in this offering on a cash basis could be decreased upon the occurrence of certain events, which could<br />result in a decrease in our stock price and have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. <br />The warrants being offered do not confer<br />any rights of common stock ownership on their holders, such as voting rights or the right to receive dividends, but rather merely<br />represent the right to acquire shares of common stock at a fixed price for a limited period of time. Specifically, commencing on<br />the date of issuance, holders of the warrants may exercise their right to acquire the common stock and pay an exercise price per<br />share equal to 120% of the public offering price, or $1.38 per share prior to five years from the date of issuance, after which<br />date any unexercised warrants will expire and have no further value. Moreover, there can also be no assurance that the market price<br />of the common stock will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the warrants, and consequently, whether it will ever be profitable<br />for holders of the warrants to exercise the warrants.<br />RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS<br />We will need to raise additional<br />capital to operate our business and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development<br />programs or commercialization efforts.<br />During the six months ended June 30,2018,<br />our operating activities used net cash of approximately $10.4 million and as of June 30, 2018 our cash and cash equivalents were<br />$7.1 million. With the exception of the three months ended June 30,2010, we have experienced significant losses since inception<br />and have a significant accumulated deficit. As of June 30,2018, our accumulated deficit totaled approximately $200.8 million<br />on a consolidated basis. We expect to incur additional operating losses in the future and therefore expect our cumulative losses<br />to increase. With the exception of the quarter ended June 30,2010, and limited laboratory revenues from Adeona Clinical Laboratory,<br />which we sold in March 2012, we have generated very minimal revenues. We do not expect to derive revenue from any source in the<br />near future until we or our potential partners successfully commercialize our products. We expect our expenses to increase in<br />connection with our anticipated activities, particularly as we continue research and development, initiate and conduct clinical<br />trials, and seek marketing approval for our product candidates. Until such time as we receive approval from the FDA and other<br />regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we will not be permitted to sell our products and therefore will not have product<br />revenues from the sale of products. For the foreseeable future we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures<br />from equity and debt offerings, cash on hand, licensing and collaboration fees and grants, if any.<br />We will need to raise additional capital<br />to fund our operations and meet our current timelines and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms<br />on a timely basis, or at all. Based on our current plans, our cash and cash equivalents together with the proceeds of this offering<br />will not be sufficient to complete our planned Phase 3 clinical trial for SYN-004 or our planned Phase2b/3 clinical trial for<br />SYN-010. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity or debt securities, which will have<br />a dilutive effect on our stockholders. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders<br />may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability<br />to conduct our business. A failure otherwise to raise additional funds when needed in the future could result in us being unable<br />to complete planned preclinical and clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory<br />authorities. In addition, we could be forced to delay, discontinue or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing<br />efforts, and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities<br />may be limited by the rules of the SEC and NYSE American that place limits on the number and dollar amount of securities that<br />may be sold. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the funds needed, especially in light of the fact that our<br />ability to sell securities registered on our registration statement on Form S-3 will be limited until such time the market value<br />of our voting securities held by non-affiliates is $75 million or more. We also may be required to seek collaborators for our<br />product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise<br />be available.<br />We expect to continue to incur significant<br />operating and capital expenditures.<br />Other than with respect to the three months<br />ended December 31, 2017 and June 30,2010, we have a history of losses and we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial<br />losses and negative operating cash flow. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates,<br />we may still incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may not sustain profitability. We expect that our pivotal<br />Phase 2b/3 and Phase 3 clinical trials will enroll a greater number of patients than our prior clinical trials and will be more<br />costly than our prior clinical trials. In addition, we anticipate a need for additional employees as we undertake later stage<br />clinical trials. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses<br />will substantially increase in the foreseeable future as we do the following:<br /> <br />·<br />continue to undertake preclinical development and pivotal clinical trials for<br />our product candidates, including SYN-010 and SYN-004 (ribaxamase);<br /> <br />·<br />seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates;<br /> <br />·<br />develop our product candidates for commercialization;<br /> <br />·<br />implement additional internal systems and infrastructure;<br /> <br />·<br />license or acquire additional technologies;<br /> <br />·<br />lease additional or alternative office facilities;<br /> <br />·<br />manufacture product for clinical trials; and<br /> <br />·<br />hire additional personnel, including members of our management team.<br />We may experience negative cash flow for<br />the foreseeable future as we fund our development and clinical programs with capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to<br />generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or<br />achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our<br />common stock and underlying securities.<br />We currently have no significant<br />source of revenue and may never generate significant revenue. Currently, we have no products approved for commercial sale.<br />Our ability to generate revenue depends<br />heavily on:<br /> <br />·<br />our ability to raise additional capital on a timely basis to continue to fund<br />our clinical trials;<br /> <br />·<br />demonstration in current and future clinical trials that our lead product candidates,<br />SYN-010 for the treatment of IBS-C and SYN-004 (ribaxamase) for the prevention of C. difficile, are safe and effective;<br /> <br />·<br />our ability to seek and obtain regulatory approvals, including with respect to<br />the indications we are seeking;<br /> <br />·<br />successful manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates; and<br /> <br />·<br />market acceptance of our products.<br />All of our existing product candidates<br />are in various stages of development and will require extensive additional clinical evaluation, regulatory review and approval,<br />significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they could provide us with any revenue. As a result, even if we<br />successfully develop, achieve regulatory approval and commercialize our products, we may be unable to generate revenue for many<br />years, if at all. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from product sales for at least several years, if at all.<br />If we are unable to generate revenue from product sales, we will not become profitable, and we may be unable to continue our operations.<br />Our consolidated financial statements<br />have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. <br />Our consolidated financial statements<br />as of December 31, 2017 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve<br />months. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that includes an explanatory paragraph<br />referring to our recurring losses from operations and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern<br />without additional capital becoming available. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain<br />additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate<br />revenue. Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 did not include any adjustments that might result<br />from the outcome of this uncertainty.<br />Our research and development efforts<br />may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may limit our ability to achieve profitability.<br />We are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidates, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-010, which require significant<br />additional clinical testing before we can seek regulatory approval and we cannot be certain that these product candidates will<br />receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.<br />We must continue to explore opportunities<br />that may lead to new products and technologies. To accomplish this, we must commit substantial efforts, funds, and other resources<br />to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies.<br />Any such expenditures that we make will be made without any assurance that our efforts will be successful. Failure can occur at<br />any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.<br />The success of our business currently<br />depends on our development, approval and commercialization of our lead product candidates, SYN-004 and SYN-010, which are our<br />only two product candidates for which we have conducted clinical trials. Even though we are pursuing a registration pathway for<br />each of these product candidates based on specific FDA input, there are many uncertainties known and unknown that may affect the<br />outcome of future clinical trials. All of our product candidates, including SYN-004 and SYN-010, will require additional clinical<br />and non-clinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient<br />commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales. Regardless<br />of whether our clinical trials are deemed to be successful, promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may<br />only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability<br />to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or satisfy regulatory criteria, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture,<br />the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.<br />Failure to obtain regulatory approvals of SYN-004 or SYN-010 in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business.<br />Even if we successfully develop SYN-010, SYN-004 or other new products or enhancements, they may be quickly rendered obsolete<br />by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors\' innovations. Innovations may not be quickly<br />accepted in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party<br />reimbursement. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our products under development will be launched, whether<br />we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire drug candidates or products, or whether any products will be commercially<br />successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become<br />obsolete, which may limit our ability to achieve profitability.<br />We are actively seeking and may<br />form or seek strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits<br />of such alliances or licensing arrangements.<br />We are actively seeking and may form or<br />seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties<br />that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates<br />and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other<br />charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management<br />and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process<br />is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other<br />alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for<br />collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety<br />and efficacy. If we license products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable<br />to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic<br />transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering<br />into new strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization<br />of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition<br />and results of operations.<br />We may not be able to retain rights<br />licensed to us by others to commercialize key products and may not be able to establish or maintain the relationships we need<br />to develop, manufacture, and market our products.<br />In addition to our own patent applications,<br />we also currently rely on licensing agreements with third party patent holders/licensors for our products. We have an exclusive<br />license agreement with CSMC relating to our IBS-C program. This agreement requires us or our sublicensee to use our best efforts<br />to commercialize each of the technologies as well as meet certain diligence requirements and timelines in order to keep the license<br />agreement in effect. In the event we or our sublicensee are not able to meet our diligence requirements, we may not be able to<br />retain the rights granted under our agreement or renegotiate our arrangement institution on reasonable terms, or at all. If the<br />license were to terminate and we were to lose the right to commercialize our products, our business opportunity would be adversely<br />affected. Furthermore, we currently have very limited product development capabilities, and limited marketing or sales capabilities.<br />For us to research, develop, and test our product candidates, we would need to contract with outside researchers, in most cases<br />those parties that did the original research and from whom we have licensed the technologies. Our ECC agreements with Intrexon<br />provide that Intrexon may terminate an agreement if we do not perform certain specified requirements, including developing therapies<br />considered superior. Our agreement with UT Austin allows the UT Austin to terminate its agreement if we fail to comply with the<br />terms of the agreement. Our agreement with CSMC allows CSMC to terminate its agreement if we fail to comply with the terms of<br />the agreement.<br />We can give no assurances that any of<br />our issued patents licensed to us or any of our other patent applications will provide us with significant proprietary protection<br />or be of commercial benefit to us. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability,<br />nor does the issuance of a patent provide the patent holder with freedom to operate without infringing the patent rights of others.<br />We will incur additional expenses<br />in connection with our arrangements with Intrexon, our development of SYN-004, SYN 010 and SYN-020, and our agreement with CSMC.<br />Pursuant to our ECC agreements with Intrexon,<br />we are responsible for future research and development expenses of product candidates developed under our collaboration, the effect<br />of which has and will continue to increase the level of our overall research and development expenses going forward. Our agreements<br />with CSMC requires that we initiate certain studies and file or have accepted an NDA within a certain amount of time, each of<br />which are costly and will require additional expenditures. Although all manufacturing, preclinical studies and human clinical<br />trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, costs associated with the manufacturing, research and development<br />of biologic product candidates are generally greater in comparison to small molecule product candidates. We have added additional<br />personnel to support our ECC agreements with Intrexon, and research and development of our candidates, SYN-004, SYN-010 and SYN-020.<br />In addition, we have commenced or intend to commence manufacturing of SYN-004, SYN-010 and SYN-020 material to support our planned<br />preclinical and clinical studies which will require us to incur additional expenses.<br />Because our biologic programs are relatively<br />new, we have only recently assumed development responsibility and costs associated with such programs. In addition, because development<br />activities in collaboration with Intrexon are determined pursuant to joint steering committees comprised of Intrexon and ourselves<br />and we have limited product development experience, future development costs associated with these programs may be difficult to<br />anticipate and exceed our expectations. Our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number<br />of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, unanticipated technical challenges, changes in the focus and direction<br />of our development activities or adjustments necessitated by changes in the competitive landscape in which we operate. If we are<br />unable to continue to financially support such collaborations due to our own working capital constraints, we may be forced to<br />delay our activities. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may be forced to<br />seek licensing partners or discontinue development.<br />Developments by competitors may<br />render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.<br />Companies that currently sell or are developing<br />proprietary products for the prevention and treatment of C. difficile infection include: Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd.,<br />Merck & Co. Inc., Merus B.V., Pfizer Inc., and Sanofi S.A. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products<br />for IBS-C include: Actavis plc, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company<br />Limited. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for pertussis include: GlaxoSmithKline plc, MitsubishiTanabe<br />Pharma Corporation and Sanofi S.A. Companies that sell or are developing products for the treatment of PKU include: BioMarin Pharmaceutical<br />Inc., Codexis, Inc. and Synlogic, Inc. Many of our competitors have significant financial and human resources. The infectious<br />disease market is highly competitive with many generic and proprietary intravenous and oral formulations available to physicians<br />and their patients. For our monoclonal antibodies, we currently do not expect to be able to deliver our infectious disease candidates<br />via the oral route and may thus be limited to the in-patient and/or acute treatment setting. In addition, academic research centers<br />may develop technologies that compete with our SYN-004, SYN-010, SYN-005, SYN-020 products and our other technologies. Should<br />clinicians or regulatory authorities view alternative therapeutic regiments as more effective than our products, this might delay<br />or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for our products, or it might prevent us from obtaining favorable reimbursement<br />rates from payers, such as Medicare, Medicaid, hospitals and private insurers.<br />We operate in a highly competitive<br />environment.<br />The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries,<br />including the monoclonal antibody industry, are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors<br />include major multi-national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies developing both generic and proprietary therapies<br />to treat serious diseases. Many of our competitors have drugs that have already been commercialized and therefore benefit from<br />being first to market their products. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, human, research and<br />development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our potential<br />competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established<br />industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the therapeutic<br />areas we are currently pursuing.<br />Academic research centers, governmental<br />agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce<br />products directly competitive to those being developed by us. In addition, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent<br />protection, obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us. These competitors<br />will compete with us in product sales as well as recruitment and retention of qualified scientific and management personnel, establishment<br />of clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in the acquisition of technologies and technology<br />licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.<br />Competitors could develop and/or<br />gain FDA approval of our product candidates for a different indication.<br />Many of our competitors may have more<br />resources than us. We cannot provide any assurances that our products will be FDA approved prior to those of our competitors.<br />We are subject to the risk that products containing our active ingredients that are already marketed to treat other indications,<br />or future FDA approved products containing our active ingredients that are marketed to treat other indications, may be prescribed<br />by physicians, or that physicians may substitute a competitor\'s products," to treat the diseases for which we are intending<br />to commercialize; this is commonly referred to as \""""off-label\"""" use. While under FDA regulations a competitor is not<br />allowed to promote off-label uses of its product", the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine and, as a result, cannot<br />direct physicians to select certain products for their patients. Consequently, we might be limited in our ability to prevent off-label<br />use of a competitor\'s product to treat the diseases we are intending to commercialize, even if we have issued method of<br />use patents for that indication. If we are not able to obtain and enforce our patents, if any, or otherwise receive orphan drug<br />protection, a competitor could develop and commercialize similar products for the same indications that we are pursuing. We cannot<br />provide any assurances that a competitor will not obtain FDA approval for a product that contains the same active ingredients<br />as our products.<br />If the parties we depend on for<br />supplying substance raw materials for our product candidates and certain manufacturing-related services do not timely supply these<br />products and services in sufficient quality or quantity, it may delay or impair our ability to develop, manufacture and market<br />our product candidates.<br />We rely on suppliers for the substance<br />raw materials of our product candidates and third parties for manufacturing-related services to produce material that meets appropriate<br />content, quality and stability standards and use in clinical trials of our products and, after approval, for commercial distribution.<br />To succeed, clinical trials require adequate supplies of study material, which may be difficult or uneconomical to procure or<br />manufacture and there can be no assurance that we will successfully procure such study material or even if procured, that we can<br />do so in quantities and in a timely manner to allow our clinical trials to proceed as planned. We and our suppliers and vendors<br />may not be able to (i) produce our study material to appropriate standards for use in clinical studies, (ii) perform under any<br />definitive manufacturing, supply or service agreements with us, or (iii) remain in business for a sufficient time to successfully<br />produce and market our product candidates. If we do not maintain important manufacturing and service relationships, we may fail<br />to find a replacement supplier or required vendor or manufacturer which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory<br />approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If we do find replacement manufacturers<br />and vendors, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us and, there could be<br />a substantial delay before a new facility could be qualified and registered with the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.<br />The third-party manufacturers of the active<br />pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product for our lead product candidates, SYN-010 and SYN-004, are established cGMP manufacturers.<br />For all other therapeutic areas we have not yet established cGMP manufacturers for our biologic and drug candidates. We currently<br />have manufacturers for each of our lead product candidates as well as our SYN-020 program, however, we believe additional manufacturers<br />are available, if any of our manufacturers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise fail to meet the quality or delivery<br />requirements needed to satisfy the supply commitments, the process of locating and qualifying alternate sources could require<br />up to several months, during which time our production could be delayed. Any curtailment in the availability of SYN-004 or SYN-010<br />could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, because regulatory<br />authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products, changes in raw material suppliers may result<br />in production delays or higher raw material costs.<br />The manufacture of our product candidates<br />requires significant expertise and manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up production.<br />These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and<br />quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations.<br />We may experience longer than expected lead times with respect to the manufacture of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), which may result from<br />the increase in manufacturing scale necessary to conduct our anticipated Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and result in trial delays.<br />In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of our clinical trials,<br />increase the costs associated with conducting our clinical trials and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence<br />new clinical trials at significant additional expense or to terminate a clinical trial.<br />We are responsible for ensuring that each<br />of our contract manufacturers comply with the cGMP requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities from which we seek<br />to obtain product approval. While we oversee compliance, we do not have control over our manufacturers and their compliance with<br />regulatory requirements. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance<br />of records and documentation. The approval process for NDAs includes a review of the manufacturer\'s compliance with cGMP<br />requirements. We are responsible for regularly assessing a contract manufacturer\'s compliance with cGMP requirements through<br />record reviews and periodic audits and for ensuring that the contract manufacturer takes responsibility and corrective action<br />for any identified deviations.<br />A failure to comply with these requirements<br />may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or<br />recall, or withdrawal of product approval. Furthermore, if our manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities<br />on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be unable to meet demand for any approved products and would lose<br />potential revenues.<br />We may not be able to manufacture<br />our product candidates in commercial quantities, which would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.<br />To date, our product candidates have been<br />manufactured in small quantities for preclinical studies and clinical trials. If any of our product candidates is approved by<br />the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in other countries for commercial sale, we will need to manufacture such product<br />candidate in larger quantities. We may not be able to increase successfully the manufacturing capacity for any of our product<br />candidates in a timely or economic manner, or at all. Significant scale-up of manufacturing may require additional validation<br />studies, which the FDA must review and approve. If we are unable to increase successfully the manufacturing capacity for a product<br />candidate, the clinical trials as well as the regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed<br />or there may be a shortage in supply. Our product candidates require precise, high quality manufacturing. Our failure to achieve<br />and maintain these high quality manufacturing standards in collaboration with our third-party manufacturers, including the incidence<br />of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product<br />testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.<br />If we do not obtain the necessary<br />regulatory approvals in the U.S. and/or other countries we will not be able to sell our product candidates.<br />We cannot assure you that we will receive<br />the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates or any product candidates we acquire or develop in the<br />future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. and approvals from the FDA-equivalent regulatory<br />authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. We will be required to conduct<br />clinical trials that will be costly. We cannot predict whether our clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of<br />our product candidates or if the results of any clinical trials will be sufficient to advance to the next phase of development<br />or for approval from the FDA. We also cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs or therapeutics<br />that the FDA considers safe and effective for the proposed indications. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval<br />process. The approval process may be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action<br />or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may prevent<br />or delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from our product candidates; and diminish any competitive<br />advantages that we may otherwise believe that we hold.<br />Even if we comply with all FDA requests,<br />the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs or BLAs. We may never obtain regulatory clearance for any of our product<br />candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us<br />without a saleable product, and therefore without any source of revenues, until another product candidate can be developed. There<br />is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire another product candidate.<br />In addition, the FDA may require us to<br />conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies, as a condition to granting marketing<br />approval of a product. The results generated after approval could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling,<br />and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product. The FDA has significant post-market authority,<br />including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information,<br />and compliance with FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The FDA\'s exercise of its authority has in some<br />cases resulted, and in the future could result, in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory<br />review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of<br />approved products.<br />In foreign jurisdictions, we must also<br />receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any products, which can be time consuming<br />and costly. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures<br />described above. There can be no assurance that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidate<br />for sale outside the United States.<br />If the FDA approves any of our product<br />candidates, the labeling, manufacturing, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping<br />for our products will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements and continued regulatory oversight and review. Our drug manufacturers<br />and subcontractors that we retain will be required to comply with FDA and other regulations. We may also be subject to additional<br />FDA post-marketing obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product<br />candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, suspension of regulatory approval, suspension of production, injunctions<br />or civil or criminal sanctions. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed product, including adverse<br />events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product, and could include withdrawal<br />of the product from the market.<br />Clinical trials are very expensive,<br />time-consuming, and difficult to design and implement.<br />Human clinical trials are very expensive<br />and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial<br />process is also time-consuming. We estimate that clinical trials for our product candidates would take at least several years<br />to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon<br />or repeat clinical trials. Commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:<br /> <br />·<br />obtaining an IND application with the FDA to commence clinical trials;<br /> <br />·<br />identification of, and acceptable arrangements with, one or more clinical sites;<br /> <br />·<br />obtaining IRB approval to commence clinical trials;<br /> <br />·<br />unforeseen safety issues;<br /> <br />·<br />determination of dosing;<br /> <br />·<br />lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;<br /> <br />·<br />slower than expected rates of patient recruitment;<br /> <br />·<br />inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;<br /> <br />·<br />inability to obtain supply of our drug candidate in a timely manner;<br /> <br />·<br />inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols;<br />and<br /> <br />·<br />unwillingness of the FDA or IRBs to permit the clinical trials to be initiated.<br />In addition, we, IRBs or the FDA may suspend<br />our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if IRBs or the<br />FDA finds deficiencies in our submissions or conduct of our trials.<br />The results of our clinical trials<br />may not support our product candidate claims and the results of preclinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily<br />predictive of future results.<br />To date, long-term safety and efficacy<br />have not yet been demonstrated in clinical trials for any of our product candidates. Favorable results in our early studies or<br />trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials. Even if our clinical trials are initiated and completed as planned, we<br />cannot be certain that the results will support our product candidate claims. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical<br />trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Success of our predecessor P1A clinical product or positive<br />topline data from our previous SYN-004 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, does not ensure success of SYN-004, and positive topline<br />data for our SYN-010 Phase 2 clinical trials does not ensure success of SYN-010. Furthermore, the FDA could determine that SYN-004<br />has not demonstrated safety and require additional clinical trials and safety data, despite positive results from our SYN-004<br />Phase 2b clinical trial and the determination by clinical sites investigators and an independent third party that the adverse<br />events that occurred in the group that received SYN-004 in our Phase 2b clinical trial were not drug related. We cannot be sure<br />that the results of later clinical trials would replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing nor that<br />they would satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that our<br />product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry<br />have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding<br />promising results in earlier trials. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products. Any<br />such failure could cause us or our sublicensee to abandon a product candidate and might delay development of other product candidates.<br />Preclinical and clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory<br />approvals or commercialization. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay our obtaining FDA approval for<br />the affected product candidate and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize that product candidate.<br />If we encounter difficulties enrolling<br />patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.<br />Delays in patient enrollment may result<br />in increased cost or may adversely affect timing or outcome of planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these<br />trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates.<br />Delays in clinical testing could<br />result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenue.<br />We may experience delays in clinical testing<br />of our product candidates. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, will need to be redesigned or will<br />be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in obtaining regulatory<br />approval to commence a clinical trial, in securing clinical trial agreements with prospective sites with acceptable terms, in<br />obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, in recruiting patients to participate<br />in a clinical trial or in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials. Manufacturing considerations for SYN-004<br />(ribaxamase) and our other product candidates may include an expected several month lead time following a decision to commence<br />any clinical trial(s) and capacity considerations of our third-party contract manufacturers to provide clinical supply of SYN-004<br />or our other product candidates could cause delays in clinical trials. Many factors affect patient enrollment, including the size<br />of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, competing<br />clinical trials and new drugs approved for the conditions we are investigating. Clinical investigators will need to decide whether<br />to offer their patients enrollment in clinical trials of our product candidates versus treating these patients with commercially<br />available drugs that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase<br />our costs, slow down our product development and timeliness and approval process and delay our ability to generate revenue.<br />Patients who are administered our<br />product candidates may experience unexpected side effects or other safety risks that could cause a halt in their clinical development,<br />preclude approval of our product candidates or limit their commercial potential.<br />Our clinical trials may be suspended at<br />any time for a number of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they<br />present an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may order the temporary<br />or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted<br />in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to the clinical trial patients.<br />For example, the FDA could determine that SYN-004 has not demonstrated safety and require additional clinical trials and safety<br />data, despite positive results from our SYN-004 Phase 2b clinical trial and the determination by clinical sites investigators<br />and an independent third party that the adverse events that occurred in the group that received SYN-004 in our Phase 2b clinical<br />trial were not drug related.<br />Administering any product candidate to<br />humans may produce undesirable side effects. These side effects could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of our product<br />candidates and could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying further development or approval of our product<br />candidates for any or all targeted indications. Ultimately, some or all of our product candidates may prove to be unsafe for human<br />use. Moreover, we could be subject to significant liability if any volunteer or patient suffers, or appears to suffer, adverse<br />health effects as a result of participating in our clinical trials. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining<br />market acceptance of our product candidates and could substantially increase commercialization costs.<br />An NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2)<br />subjects us to the risk that we may be subject to a patent infringement lawsuit that would delay or prevent the review or approval<br />of our product candidate.<br />We plan to submit SYN-010 to the FDA for<br />approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information<br />required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by, or for, the applicant and on which the applicant has not<br />obtained a right of reference. The 505(b)(2) application would enable us to reference published literature and/or the FDA\'s<br />previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the branded reference drug. For NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the<br />FDCA, the patent certification and related provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act apply. In accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act,<br />such NDAs may be required to include certifications, known as paragraph IV certifications, that certify that any patents listed<br />in the Patent and Exclusivity Information Addendum of the FDA\'s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence<br />Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, with respect to any product referenced in the 505(b)(2) application, are invalid,<br />unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the product that is the subject of the 505(b)(2) NDA.<br />Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the holder<br />of patents that the 505(b)(2) application references may file a patent infringement lawsuit after receiving notice of the paragraph<br />IV certification. Filing of a patent infringement lawsuit against the filer of the 505(b)(2) applicant within 45 days of the patent<br />owner\'s receipt of notice triggers a one-time, automatic, 30-month stay of the FDA\'s ability to approve the 505(b)(2)<br />NDA, unless patent litigation is resolved in the favor of the paragraph IV filer or the patent expires before that time. Accordingly,<br />we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of one or more product candidates only to be subject<br />to significant delay and patent litigation before such product candidates may be commercialized, if at all. In addition, a 505(b)(2)<br />application will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical<br />entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. The FDA may also require us to perform one or more additional<br />clinical studies or measurements to support the change from the branded reference drug, which could be time consuming and could<br />substantially delay our achievement of regulatory approvals for such product candidates. The FDA may also reject our future 505(b)(2)<br />submissions and require us to file such submissions under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, which would require us to provide extensive<br />data to establish safety and effectiveness of the drug for the proposed use and could cause delay and be considerably more expensive<br />and time consuming. These factors, among others, may limit our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.<br />Our product candidates, if approved<br />for sale, may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate<br />revenues.<br />If one of our product candidates is approved<br />for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product by physicians,<br />healthcare professionals and third-party payors and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors, including:<br /> <br />·<br />demonstration of safety and efficacy;<br /> <br />·<br />changes in the practice guidelines and the standard of care for the targeted indication;<br /> <br />·<br />relative convenience and ease of administration;<br /> <br />·<br />the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;<br /> <br />·<br />budget impact of adoption of our product on relevant drug formularies;<br /> <br />·<br />the availability, cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments, including<br />less expensive generic drugs;<br /> <br />·<br />pricing, reimbursement and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory<br />control;<br /> <br />·<br />effectiveness of our or any of our partners\' sales and marketing strategies;<br /> <br />·<br />the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority<br />in other countries; and<br /> <br />·<br />the availability of adequate third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.<br />If any product candidate that we develop<br />does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as, or is perceived as being as beneficial as, the current standard<br />of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other<br />regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance. Our ability to effectively promote and sell any approved products<br />will also depend on pricing and cost-effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and our<br />ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve<br />an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payors, our ability to generate revenues from that product<br />would be substantially reduced. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits<br />of our product candidates may require significant resources, may be constrained by FDA rules and policies on product promotion,<br />and may never be successful.<br />We depend on third parties, including<br />researchers and sublicensees, who are not under our control. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual<br />duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to seek or obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.<br />Since we have in-licensed some of our<br />product candidates, have sublicensed a product candidate and have collaboration agreements for the development of other product<br />candidates, we depend upon our sublicensee and independent investigators and scientific collaborators, such as universities and<br />medical institutions or private physician scientists, to advise us and to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements<br />with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to<br />our programs or the timing of their procurement of clinical-trial data or their compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines.<br />Should any of these scientific inventors/advisors or those of our sublicensee become disabled or die unexpectedly, or should they<br />fail to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines, we or our sublicensee may be forced to scale back or terminate development<br />of that program. They may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking<br />those programs ourselves. Failing to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or substandard performance<br />and failure to comply with regulatory guidelines, could result in delay of any FDA applications and our commercialization of the<br />drug candidate involved.<br />These collaborators may also have relationships<br />with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Our collaborators assisting our competitors could harm our<br />competitive position. For example, we are highly dependent on scientific collaborators for our IBS-C development program, each<br />of whom are employed by third parties.<br />With respect to our product candidates<br />in collaboration with Intrexon, we are dependent upon Intrexon\'s synthetic biology facilities and capabilities as we have<br />no such facilities and capabilities of our own. We are also reliant on their vectors, monoclonal antibody discovery, production<br />cell line development and know-how.<br />With respect to our product candidate<br />for pertussis in collaboration with University of Texas at Austin, we are dependent on its research laboratories as we have no<br />such facilities or capabilities of our own. If any of the foregoing were to become inaccessible or terminated, it would be difficult<br />for us to develop and commercialize our synthetic biologic product candidates.<br />We have in the past and expect to have<br />in the future agreements with third-party contract research organizations (CROs), under which we have delegated to the CROs the<br />responsibility to coordinate and monitor the conduct of our SYN-004 and SYN-010 clinical trials and to manage data for our clinical<br />programs. We, our CROs and our clinical sites are required to comply with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, regulations<br />and guidelines issued by the FDA and by similar governmental authorities in other countries where we are conducting clinical trials.<br />We have an ongoing obligation to monitor the activities conducted by our CROs and at our clinical sites to confirm compliance<br />with these requirements. In the future, if we, our CROs or our clinical sites fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical<br />data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials<br />before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP<br />regulations, and will require a large number of test subjects. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to<br />repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual<br />duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data<br />they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons,<br />our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully<br />commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates<br />would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.<br />We currently have no marketing,<br />sales or distribution organization and have no experience in marketing products as a company. If we are unable to establish marketing<br />and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able<br />to generate product revenue.<br />We currently have no marketing, sales<br />or distribution capabilities and have no experience in marketing products. We may develop an in-house marketing organization and<br />sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with<br />other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel.<br />If we are unable or decide not to establish<br />internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing<br />of our products; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements.<br />Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or<br />no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if<br />we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us<br />with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.<br />There can be no assurance that we will<br />be able to develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators<br />to commercialize any product in the United States or overseas.<br />Even if our products are approved,<br />if doctors decide not to prescribe SYN-010 or hospitals decide not to prescribe SYN-004, we may be unable to generate sufficient<br />revenue to sustain our business.<br />To increase awareness and adoption of<br />our products once approved, we and our collaborators will need to educate doctors and hospitals on the benefits and value of our<br />products through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education sessions. In addition, we<br />and our collaborators will need to assure doctors of our ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement coverage from third-party<br />payors. We and our collaborators may need to hire additional commercial, scientific, technical, sales and marketing and other<br />personnel to support this process. If our educational efforts fail and medical practitioners do not decide to prescribe our products<br />in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our business. In addition, factors outside of<br />our control, such as insurance reimbursement are expected to influence market acceptance of our products. Accordingly, even if<br />we receive regulatory approval for the use of our products, we may not be successful in generating revenue from the sale of our<br />products.<br />Reimbursement may not be available<br />for our product candidates, which would impede sales.<br />Market acceptance and sales of our product<br />candidates may depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and health care reform measures. Decisions about formulary coverage<br />as well as levels at which government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance<br />organizations, reimburse patients for the price they pay for our products as well as levels at which these payors pay directly<br />for our products, where applicable, could affect whether we are able to commercialize these products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement<br />will be available for any of our products. Also, we cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement amounts will not reduce the<br />demand for, or the price of, our products. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels,<br />we may not be able to commercialize our products.<br />In recent years, officials have made numerous<br />proposals to change the health care system in the United States. These proposals include measures that would limit or prohibit<br />payments for certain medical treatments or subject the pricing of drugs to government control. In addition, in many foreign countries,<br />particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. If our products<br />are or become subject to government regulation that limits or prohibits payment for our products, or that subjects the price of<br />our products to governmental control, we may not be able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.<br />As a result of legislative proposals and<br />the trend towards managed health care in the United States, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care<br />costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also impose strict prior authorization requirements<br />and/or refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA<br />has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse<br />patients for their use of newly-approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs.<br />Healthcare reform measures could<br />hinder or prevent our product candidates\' commercial success.<br />The U.S. government and other governments<br />have shown significant interest in pursuing continued healthcare reform. Any government-adopted reform measures could adversely<br />impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement<br />available from governmental agencies or other third party payors. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments,<br />insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs<br />may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues<br />and achieve and maintain profitability.<br />New laws, regulations and judicial decisions,<br />or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, that relate to healthcare availability, methods of delivery<br />or payment for products and services, or sales, marketing or pricing, may limit our potential revenue, and we may need to revise<br />our research and development programs. The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging<br />due to several reasons, including policies advanced by the current executive administration in the United States, new healthcare<br />legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, in both the United States<br />and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system<br />in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.<br />If product liability lawsuits are<br />successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product<br />candidates.<br />We face an inherent risk of product liability<br />lawsuits related to the testing of our product candidates, and will face an even greater risk if we sell our product candidates<br />commercially. Currently, we are not aware of any anticipated product liability claims with respect to our product candidates.<br />In the future, an individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears<br />to have caused, an injury. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against the product liability claim, we may incur substantial<br />liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:<br /> <br />·<br />decreased demand for our product candidates;<br /> <br />·<br />injury to our reputation;<br /> <br />·<br />withdrawal of clinical trial participants;<br /> <br />·<br />costs of related litigation;<br /> <br />·<br />initiation of investigations by regulators;<br /> <br />·<br />substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;<br /> <br />·<br />distraction of management\'s attention from our primary business;<br /> <br />·<br />loss of revenue; and<br /> <br />·<br />the inability to commercialize our product candidates.<br />We have clinical trial liability insurance.<br />We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for our<br />product candidates. Our current insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us. In<br />addition, because of the increasing costs of insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable<br />cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy liabilities that may arise.<br />We rely on patent applications and<br />various regulatory exclusivities to protect some of our product candidates and our ability to compete may be limited or eliminated<br />if we are not able to protect our products.<br />The patent positions of pharmaceutical<br />companies are uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions. We may incur significant expenses in protecting our<br />intellectual property and defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by others. Any patent or other<br />infringement litigation by or against us could cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management.<br />Others may file patent applications or<br />obtain patents on similar technologies or compounds that compete with our products. We cannot predict how broad the claims in<br />any such patents or applications will be, and whether they will be allowed. Once claims have been issued, we cannot predict how<br />they will be construed or enforced. We may infringe intellectual property rights of others without being aware of it. If another<br />party claims we are infringing their technology, we could have to defend an expensive and time consuming lawsuit, pay a large<br />sum if we are found to be infringing, or be prohibited from selling or licensing our products unless we obtain a license or redesign<br />our product, which may not be possible.<br />We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary<br />know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Some of our current or former employees, consultants, scientific advisors,<br />current or prospective corporate collaborators, may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors<br />or use our proprietary technology for their own benefit. Furthermore, enforcing a claim alleging the infringement of our trade<br />secrets would be expensive and difficult to prove, making the outcome uncertain. Our competitors may also independently develop<br />similar knowledge, methods, and know-how or gain access to our proprietary information through some other means.<br />We may incur substantial costs as<br />a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, as well as costs associated<br />with lawsuits.<br />If any other person files patent applications,<br />or is issued patents, claiming technology also claimed by us in pending applications, we may be required to participate in interference<br />proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention. We, or our licensors, may also need to<br />participate in interference proceedings involving our issued patents and pending applications of another entity.<br />The intellectual property environment<br />in the monoclonal antibody field is particularly complex, constantly evolving and highly fragmented. We have not conducted freedom-to-use<br />patent searches on all aspects of our product candidates or potential product candidates, and we may be unaware of relevant patents<br />and patent applications of third parties. In addition, the freedom-to-use patent searches that have been conducted may not have<br />identified all relevant issued patents or pending patents. We cannot provide assurance that our proposed products in this area<br />will not ultimately be held to infringe one or more valid claims owned by third parties which may exist or come to exist in the<br />future or that in such case we will be able to obtain a license from such parties on acceptable terms.<br />We cannot guarantee that the practice<br />of our technologies will not conflict with the rights of others. In some foreign jurisdictions, we could become involved in opposition<br />proceedings, either by opposing the validity of another\'s foreign patent or by persons opposing the validity of our foreign<br />patents.<br />We may also face frivolous litigation<br />or lawsuits from various competitors or from litigious securities attorneys. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding<br />relating to these areas, even if deemed frivolous or resolved in our favor, could be substantial and could distract management<br />from our business. Uncertainties resulting from initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect<br />on our ability to continue our operations.<br />If we infringe the rights of others<br />we could be prevented from selling products or forced to pay damages.<br />If our products, methods, processes, and<br />other technologies are found to infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could be required to pay damages, or we may<br />be required to cease using the technology or to license rights from the prevailing party. Any prevailing party may be unwilling<br />to offer us a license on commercially acceptable terms.<br />We do not have a guarantee of patent<br />term restoration and marketing exclusivity of the ingredients for our drugs even if we are granted FDA approval of our products.<br />The U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent<br />Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman) permits the FDA to approve Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for generic versions<br />of innovator drugs, as well as NDAs with less original clinical data, and provides patent restoration and exclusivity protections<br />to innovator drug manufacturers. The ANDA process permits competitor companies to obtain marketing approval for drugs with the<br />same active ingredient and for the same uses as innovator drugs, but does not require the conduct and submission of clinical studies<br />demonstrating safety and efficacy. As a result, a competitor could copy any of our drugs and only need to submit data demonstrating<br />that the copy is bioequivalent to gain marketing approval from the FDA. Hatch-Waxman requires a competitor that submits an ANDA,<br />or otherwise relies on safety and efficacy data for one of our drugs, to notify us and/or our business partners of potential infringement<br />of our patent rights. We and/or our business partners may sue the company for patent infringement, which would result in a 30-month<br />stay of approval of the competitor\'s application. The discovery, trial and appeals process in such suits can take several<br />years. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the generic applicant or the challenged patent expires during the 30-month period,<br />the stay is lifted and the FDA may approve the application. Hatch-Waxman also allows competitors to market copies of innovator<br />products by submitting significantly less clinical data outside the ANDA context. Such applications, known as Section 505(b)(2)<br />NDAs may rely on clinical investigations not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a<br />right of reference or use and are subject to the ANDA notification procedures described above.<br />The law also permits restoration of a<br />portion of a product\'s patent term that is lost during clinical development and NDA review, and provides statutory protection,<br />known as exclusivity, against FDA approval or acceptance of certain competitor applications. Restoration can return up to five<br />years of patent term for a patent covering a new product or its use to compensate for time lost during product development and<br />regulatory review. The restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and submission of<br />an NDA, plus the time between NDA submission and its approval (subject to the five-year limit), and no extension can extend total<br />patent life beyond 14 years after the drug approval date. Applications for patent term extension are subject to U.S. Patent and<br />Trademark Office (USPTO) approval, in conjunction with FDA. Approval of these applications takes at least nine months," and there<br />can be no guarantee that it will be given at all.<br />Hatch-Waxman also provides for differing<br />periods of statutory protection for new drugs approved under an NDA. Among the types of exclusivity are those for a \""""new<br />chemical entity\"""" and those for a new formulation or indication for a previously-approved drug. If granted", marketing exclusivity<br />for the types of products that we are developing, which include only drugs with innovative changes to previously-approved products<br />using the same active ingredient, would prohibit the FDA from approving an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA relying on our safety and efficacy<br />data for three years. This three-year exclusivity, however, covers only the innovation associated with the original NDA. It does<br />not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs with the same active ingredient but without our new innovative change.<br />These marketing exclusivity protections do not prohibit the FDA from approving a full NDA, even if it contains the innovative<br />change.<br />The technology on which our channel<br />partnering arrangements with Intrexon are based on early stage technology.<br />On August 8,2012, we announced an exclusive<br />channel collaboration with Intrexon relating to the design, production, testing and commercialization of human recombinant monoclonal<br />antibodies for the treatment of certain infectious diseases. Although monoclonal antibody therapeutics are well established in<br />the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, their use for the treatment of infectious disease is extremely limited. In order<br />for monoclonal antibodies to be effective for infectious diseases, they must not only properly target the organism of interest<br />(or its toxins), but may also need to overcome defenses and forms of resistance of such organisms. To accomplish this may require<br />the use of more than one specific monoclonal antibody, and mixtures of different monoclonal antibodies, which may create additional<br />unforeseen complications, including increased manufacturing complexity and expense. In order to be competitive, monoclonal antibodies<br />will be required to be produced at a low enough cost of goods in order to be profitably marketed. We have very limited development<br />and manufacturing experience in the field of monoclonal antibodies and infectious disease. We cannot assure that any monoclonal<br />antibody candidates will provide satisfactory in vitro and in vivo nonclinical results sufficient to warrant the<br />expense of cGMP manufacture and clinical testing in human clinical trials.<br />On August 10,2015," we expanded our relationship<br />with Intrexon and entered into an ECC that governs a \""""channel collaboration\"""" arrangement in which we intend to use<br />Intrexon\'s technology for development of biotherapeutic products for the treatment of PKU in humans. The strategy is to<br />orally deliver a bacterium", Lactococcus lactis, that has been engineered to efficiently degrade phenylalanine in the GI<br />tract to prevent phenylalanine absorption into the blood. The strategy is supported by data from rodent studies. The extent to<br />which the data translate to large animal models and to a human therapeutic remains unknown. While genetically-modified versions<br />of Lactococcus lactis have been tested in human clinical trials for other indications, the regulatory paths for recombinant<br />bacterial products have not been fully established.<br />We do not expect to generate any<br />additional revenue from our sublicense with Meda AB due to recent developments in Europe.<br />On May 6,2010, we entered into a sublicense<br />agreement with Meda AB whereby we were given the right to receive certain milestone payments totaling $17.5 million (including<br />an upfront payment of $2.5 million that was received in 2010), plus certain royalties on our flupirtine program. Meda AB informed<br />us that due to the decision of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to limit the use of flupirtine for long-term pill and systemic<br />use, it has postponed its planned fibromyalgia clinical trials in the U.S. Therefore, we do not expect that the various milestones<br />set forth in the sublicense agreement will be achieved by Meda AB, or that Meda AB will develop flupirtine for fibromyalgia in<br />the U.S., Canada or Japan and accordingly we do not expect to receive any additional milestone payments or royalties on sales<br />in connection with the sublicense agreement.<br />We may fail to retain or recruit<br />necessary personnel, and we may be unable to secure the services of consultants.<br />As of September 30,2018, we employed<br />25 individuals, 24 of whom are full-time employees. We have also engaged clinical consultants to advise us on our clinical programs<br />and regulatory consultants to advise us on our dealings with the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities. We have been and<br />will be required to retain additional consultants and employees in order to fulfill our obligations under the ECC agreements with<br />Intrexon, our development of SYN 010 and SYN-004 and our agreement with CSMC. Our future performance will depend in part on our<br />ability to successfully integrate newly hired officers into our management team and our ability to develop an effective working<br />relationship among senior management.<br />Certain of our directors, scientific advisors,<br />and consultants serve as officers, directors, scientific advisors, or consultants of other biopharmaceutical or biotechnology<br />companies that might be developing competitive products to ours. Other than corporate opportunities, none of our directors are<br />obligated under any agreement or understanding with us to make any additional products or technologies available to us. Similarly,<br />we can give no assurances, and we do not expect and stockholders should not expect, that any biomedical or pharmaceutical product<br />or technology identified by any of our directors or affiliates in the future would be made available to us other than corporate<br />opportunities. We can give no assurances that any such other companies will not have interests that are in conflict with our interests.<br />Losing key personnel or failing to recruit<br />necessary additional personnel would impede our ability to attain our development objectives. There is intense competition for<br />qualified personnel in the drug and biologic development areas, and we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel<br />we would need to develop our business.<br />We rely on independent organizations,<br />advisors, and consultants to perform certain services for us, including handling substantially all aspects of regulatory approval,<br />clinical management, manufacturing, marketing, and sales. We expect that this will continue to be the case. Such services may<br />not always be available to us on a timely basis when we need them.<br />We expect to increase the size of<br />our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.<br />We are a small company with 25 employees<br />as of September 30, 2018. To continue our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates, we will need to expand our<br />employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities<br />on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. Our future financial<br />performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability<br />to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:<br /> <br />·<br />manage development efforts effectively; <br />·<br />manage our commercialization activities effectively; <br />·<br />integrate additional management, administrative, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel; <br />·<br />maintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and <br />·<br />hire and train additional qualified personnel.<br />We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure<br />to accomplish any of them could harm our financial results and impact our ability to achieve development milestones.<br />Our management team may invest or<br />spend the proceeds of our prior offerings and future offerings in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield<br />a significant return.<br />Our management will have broad discretion<br />over the use of proceeds from our offerings. The net proceeds from our offerings, including sales made under the sales agreement<br />that we entered into on August 5, 2016 with FBR Capital Markets & Co. now known as B. Riley FBR," Inc. (the \""""B. Riley<br />FBR Sales Agreement\"""")", will be used primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, for<br />clinical trials for our product candidates, paying general and administrative expenses and accounts payable, increasing our working<br />capital, funding research and development and funding capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for<br />licensing or acquiring intellectual property to incorporate into our products and product candidates or our research and development<br />programs and to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products, although we have no commitments or agreements<br />with respect to any such licenses, acquisitions or investments as of the date of this filing supplement. Our management will have<br />considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will not have the opportunity, as part of their<br />investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes<br />that do not increase our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure of our management to use funds<br />effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impair<br />the commercialization of our products and/or delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use, we may invest<br />the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities.<br />These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders.<br />RISKS RELATING TO OUR SECURITIES<br />We cannot assure you that our common<br />stock will be liquid or that it will remain listed on the NYSE American. A failure to regain compliance with the NYSE American<br />stockholders equity listing requirements or failure to continue to meet the other listing requirements could result in a de-listing<br />of our common stock.<br />Our common stock is listed on the NYSE<br />American. The NYSE American\'s listing standards generally mandate that we meet certain requirements relating to stockholders\'<br />equity, stock price, market capitalization, aggregate market value of publicly held shares and distribution requirements. We cannot<br />assure you that we will be able to maintain the continued listing standards of the NYSE American. The NYSE American requires companies<br />to meet certain continued listing criteria including a minimum stockholders\' equity of $6.0 million if an issuer has sustained<br />losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent years, as outlined in the NYSE American Company Guide.<br />At June 30,2018, we had stockholders\' deficit of $208.8 million. The NYSE American Company Guide also states that the NYSE<br />normally will not consider removing from listing securities of an issuer with total value of market capitalization of at least<br />$50.0 million and 1,100,000 shares publicly held, a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15.0 million and 400 round<br />lot shareholders. Although we have more than 1,100,000 shares publicly held and 400 round lot shareholders, our stock price is<br />volatile and, during the first two quarters of 2018, the price of our common stock experienced a sustained decrease resulting<br />in a period where our market capitalization fell below $50.0 million. Our market capitalization is currently below $50.0 million.<br />On March 7,2018, we announced that we<br />received written communication from the NYSE American stating we were no longer in compliance with certain continued listing standards<br />as set forth in the NYSE American Company Guide. Specifically, based on our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December<br />31,2017, and filed with the SEC on February 22,2018, we are below compliance with Part 10, Section 1003(iii) of the NYSE American<br />Company Guide since we reported a stockholders\' deficit of $1.5 million and net losses in five of our most recent fiscal<br />years as of December 31, 2017. On April 3,2018, we submitted a plan of compliance to the NYSE American outlining our plan to<br />regain compliance with certain continued listing standards as set forth in Part 10, Section 1003(iii) of the NYSE American Company<br />Guide by September 2,2018, the conclusion of the compliance plan period. There can be no assurance that we can regain compliance<br />with the listing standard of the NYSE American, or that the NYSE American will continue to list our common stock if we regain<br />compliance, or if we continue to fail to maintain the minimum stockholders\' equity. In addition, in the future we may not<br />be able to maintain such minimum stockholders\' equity and/or issue additional equity securities in exchange for cash or<br />other assets, if available, to maintain certain minimum stockholders\' equity required by the NYSE American. If we are delisted<br />from the NYSE American then our common stock will trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin<br />Board securities market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer market makers comply with quotation requirements.<br />If our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American due to our failure to regain compliance with the listing standards by the<br />end of the compliance period or for any other reason, and the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates<br />remains below $15 million, we will likely no longer be eligible to sell common stock pursuant to the B. Riley FBR Sales Agreement<br />or otherwise utilize our shelf registration statement. In addition, delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price,<br />substantially limit liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable<br />to us, or at all. Delisting from the NYSE American could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence<br />by suppliers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. On May 18,<br />2018 we received notification from the NYSE American that NYSE Regulation has reviewed our plan of compliance and determined to<br />accept the plan and grant a plan period through September 2, 2019. NYSE Regulation staff will review our company periodically<br />for compliance with the initiatives outlined in the plan. If we are not in compliance with the continued listing standards by<br />September 2, 2019 or if we do not make progress consistent with the plan during the plan period, NYSE Regulation staff will initiate<br />delisting proceeding as appropriate.<br />If our common stock falls below $0.20<br />per share on a 30-trading-day average it will become subject to the continued listing evaluation and follow-up procedures set<br />forth in Section 1009 of the NYSE American Company Guide which could, among other things, result in initiation of immediate delisting<br />procedures. In the event that we were to fail to meet the requirements of NYSE American per share price requirement or stockholders<br />equity requirement and we could not timely cure such deficiency, our listing could become subject to NYSE American continued listing<br />evaluation and follow-up procedures, which could result in delisting procedures. Based on the low stock price on July 28,<br />2018, our board of directors approved a one-for-thirty-five proportionate<br />reverse stock split of our authorized number of shares of common stock and our outstanding number of shares of common stock that<br />we effected on August 10, 2018. However, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in a sustained higher<br />stock price that will allow us to meet the NYSE American stock price listing requirements or that the reverse stock split will<br />not inhibit our ability to seek equity financing as a remedy to regain compliance with NYSE American stockholders\' equity<br />requirements.<br />Holders of our warrants issued in<br />our October 2014 offering, and our November 2016 offering, and our Series A Preferred Stock have no rights as common stockholders<br />until they exercise their warrants or convert their Series A Preferred Stock and acquire our common stock.<br />Until the holders of the warrants we issued<br />in our October 2014 offering and our November 2016 offering and the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock acquire shares of<br />our common stock by exercising their warrants or converting their Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, the holders have no<br />rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares of common stock underlying their securities. Upon exercise of the warrants<br />or conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only<br />as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.<br />Because there is no established public<br />trading market for the October 2014 or November 2016 warrants or the Series A Preferred Stock we issued, the liquidity of each<br />such security is limited. We do not expect a market to develop, nor do we intend to apply to list the October 2014 or November<br />2016 warrants or the Series A Preferred Stock on any securities exchange. Upon exercise of the October 2014 or November 2016 warrants<br />and conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, our stockholders will experience dilution.<br />The fundamental change purchase<br />feature of the warrants we issued in our November 2016 offering may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over<br />our company.<br />The terms of the November 2016 warrants<br />require us to offer to purchase the warrants for cash in the event of a fundamental change, as defined. This feature may have<br />the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.<br />Warrants are a risky investment.<br />Holders of outstanding warrants may not be able to recover the investment in the warrants, and the warrants may expire worthless.<br />Whether our outstanding warrants will<br />have any value will depend on the market conditions for, and the price of, our common stock, which conditions will depend on factors<br />related and unrelated to the success of our clinical development program, and cannot be predicted at this time.<br />If our common stock price does not increase<br />to an amount sufficiently above the exercise prices of the warrants during the periods the warrants are exercisable, holders of<br />warrants will be unable to recover any of their investment in the warrants. In fact, the warrants issued in November 2016 that<br />had an exercise price of $60.20 (post reverse stock split) expired unexercised because their exercise price was above the common<br />stock trading price. There can be no assurance that any of the factors that could impact the trading price of our common stock<br />will result in the trading price increasing to an amount that will exceed the exercise price or the price required for holders<br />of warrants to achieve a positive return on their investment in the warrants.<br />We may not have the funds necessary<br />to fulfill our obligation to repurchase the November 2016 warrants.<br />Under certain circumstances, if an extraordinary<br />transaction (as defined in the warrant agreement) occurs, holders of the warrants issued in November 2016 may require us to repurchase<br />the remaining unexercised portion of such warrants for an amount of cash equal to the value of the warrant as determined in accordance<br />with the Black Scholes option pricing model and the terms of the warrants. Our ability to repurchase the warrants depends on our<br />ability to generate cash flow in the future. To some extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative<br />and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain sufficient cash<br />reserves or that our business will generate cash flow from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to repurchase the warrants.<br />The issuance of shares of common<br />stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock would reduce the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, would<br />dilute the ownership of such holders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.<br />The conversion of the Series A Preferred<br />Stock to common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public<br />market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices<br />of our common stock. Sales by such holders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the<br />perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.<br />The holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock<br />may exercise significant influence over us.<br />The holders of the Series A Preferred<br />Stock will own approximately 9% (without taking into account the securities offered in the offering) of our shares of common<br />stock on a fully diluted as-converted basis based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date hereof.<br /> <br />In addition, under the terms of the Certificate<br />of Designation that governs the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock generally ranks, with respect to liquidation,<br />dividends and redemption, senior to other securities (including our common stock and Series B Preferred) and, so long as any shares<br />of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the approval of the holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding<br />at the time of approval is required in order for us to, among other things, (i) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences<br />or rights given to the Series A Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Certificate of Designation; (ii) amend our Articles of Incorporation<br />or bylaws in any manner that adversely affects any powers, preferences or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock; (iii) authorize<br />or create any series or class of stock ranking as to redemption, distribution of assets upon a Liquidation Event (as defined in<br />the Certificate of Designation) or dividends senior to, or otherwise pari passu with, the Series A Preferred Stock; (iv)<br />declare or make any dividends other than dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock or other distributions payable solely<br />in common stock; (v) authorize any increase in the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or issue any additional shares<br />of Series A Preferred Stock; or (vi) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.<br />The holders of Series A Preferred<br />Stock have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders<br />and holders of our Series B Preferred Stock.<br />Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding<br />up, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive out of our assets, in preference to the holders of<br />the common stock and any junior preferred stock (including the Series B Preferred offered hereby), an amount per share equal to<br />the greater of (i) the sum of the Accreted Value (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) plus an amount equal to all accrued<br />or declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock that have not previously been added to the Accrued Value, or<br />(ii) the amount that such shares would have been entitled to receive if they had converted into common stock immediately prior<br />to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, upon consummation of a specified change of control transaction, each<br />holder of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to have us redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a price specified in the<br />Certificate of Designation. These provisions may make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in a business combination<br />transaction with us. Provisions that have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the<br />opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that<br />some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. If there are insufficient assets to pay in full such amounts, then the<br />available assets will be ratably distributed to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the respective<br />amounts that would be payable on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. This will reduce the remaining<br />amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common stock. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock<br />also have a preferential right to receive cumulative dividends on the Accreted Value of each share of Series A Preferred Stock<br />at an initial rate of 2% per annum, compounded quarterly.<br />In addition, the holders of the Series<br />A Preferred Stock also have certain redemption and conversion rights.<br />Our obligations to the holders of Series<br />A Preferred Stock could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an<br />adverse effect on our financial condition. These preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders<br />of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and holders of our common stock and Series B Preferred.<br />The redemption right of the holders<br />of the Series A Preferred Stock may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial change of control transaction or result in a depletion<br />of our cash in order to satisfy the redemption right of the holders Series A Preferred Stock.<br />The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock<br />provide the holders with the right to require us to redeem the stock upon a change of control for cash in the event of a fundamental<br />change, as defined. This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that would otherwise be beneficial<br />to investors or depleting our cash.<br />The market price of our common stock<br />has been and may continue to be volatile and adversely affected by various factors.<br />The market price of our common stock could<br />fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:<br /> <br />·<br />our ability to execute our business plan;<br /> <br />·<br />operating results below expectations;<br /> <br />·<br />announcements concerning product development results, including clinical trial<br />results, or intellectual property rights of others;<br /> <br />·<br />litigation or public concern about the safety of our potential products;<br /> <br />·<br />our issuance of additional securities, including debt or equity or a combination<br />thereof, necessary to fund our operating expenses;<br /> <br />·<br />announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;<br /> <br />·<br />loss of any strategic relationship;<br /> <br />·<br />industry developments, including, without limitation, changes in healthcare policies<br />or practices or third-party reimbursement policies;<br /> <br />·<br />economic and other external factors effecting U.S. or Global equity markets;<br /> <br />·<br />period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and<br /> <br />·<br />whether an active trading market in our common stock develops and is maintained.<br />In addition, the securities markets have<br />from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular<br />companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.<br />Our articles of incorporation and<br />bylaws and Nevada law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause<br />our stock price to decline.<br />Our articles of incorporation, as amended,<br />our amended and restated bylaws and Nevada law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such<br />a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. The board of directors could authorize the issuance of an additional series<br />of preferred stock that would grant holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation, special voting rights, the right<br />to receive dividends before dividends would be declared to common stockholders, and the right to the redemption of such shares,<br />possibly together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. To the extent that we do issue additional preferred<br />stock, the rights of holders of common stock could be impaired thereby, including without limitation, with respect to liquidation.<br />Provisions of our articles of incorporation,<br />as amended and our amended and restated bylaws may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove<br />our management. In particular, our articles of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, among other things:<br /> <br />·<br />provide the board of directors with the ability to alter the bylaws without stockholder<br />approval; and<br /> <br />·<br />provide that vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of<br />directors in office, although less than a quorum.<br />Our failure to fulfill all of our<br />registration requirements may cause us to suffer liquidated damages, which may be very costly.<br />Pursuant to the terms of the registration<br />rights agreement that we entered into with Intrexon and an affiliated entity, we were required to file a registration statement<br />with respect to securities issued and are required to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement. The failure to<br />do so could result in the payment of damages by us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the effectiveness<br />of any registration statement, and therefore there can be no assurance that we will not incur damages with respect to such agreements.<br />Pursuant to the terms of the registration<br />rights agreement that we entered into with holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, we are required to file a registration statement<br />with respect to the securities issued to them upon their request within certain time periods and are required to maintain the<br />effectiveness of such registration statement. The failure to do so could result in the payment of damages by us. There can be<br />no assurance that we will be able to meet the required filing deadlines or maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement,<br />and therefore there can be no assurance that we will not incur damages with respect to such agreements.<br />We do not intend to pay dividends<br />in the foreseeable future.<br />We have never paid cash dividends on our<br />common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation and growth of our business and<br />currently do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be<br />less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if the market price of our common stock price appreciates. Our<br />Series A Preferred Stockholders rank senior to our common stockholders with respect to dividends and, subject to any senior rights<br />of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series B Preferred will participate, on an as-if-converted-to-common stock<br />basis, in any dividends to the holders of common stock.<br />Resales of our common stock in the<br />public market by our stockholders may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.<br />We may issue common stock from time to<br />time in connection with future offerings. Any issuance from time to time of new shares of our common stock, or our ability to<br />issue shares of common stock in future offerings, could result in resales of our common stock by our current stockholders concerned<br />about the potential dilution of their holdings. In turn," these resales could have the effect of depressing the market price for<br />our common stock.<br />The shares of common stock offered under the B.

We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.<br />USE OF PROCEEDS<br />We estimate that the net proceeds of this<br />offering will be approximately $16.7 million, or approximately $19.3 million if the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment<br />option, based on a public offering price of $1.15 per Class A Unit and $1,000 per Class B Unit, after deducting the estimated<br />underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the<br />warrants. The public offering price per Class A Unit was determined between us, the underwriters and investors based on market<br />conditions at the time of pricing, and was at a discount to the market price of our common stock. We will only receive<br />additional proceeds from the exercise of the warrants issuable in connection with this offering if such warrants are exercised<br />at their exercise price of 120% of the public offering price of the Class A Units, or $1.38 per share, and the holders of such<br />warrants pay the exercise price in cash upon such exercise and do not utilize the cashless exercise provision of the warrants.<br />We intend to use the net proceeds, if<br />any, from the sales of securities offered by this prospectus to fund our and our subsidiaries\' preclinical and clinical<br />programs (including, but not limited to, provide approximately $5.0-$7.0 million in funding for manufacturing scale-up activities<br />to progress SYN-004 towards a potential Phase 3 clinical trial (broad indication) and/or initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial(s)<br />in a specialty population, approximately $7.5 million in funding for preclinical development and related manufacturing activities<br />in preparation for our IND and Phase 1 clinical trial for our SYN-020 program and required milestone payments) and for working<br />capital and general corporate purposes, including, to acquire, license or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, product<br />candidates or other intellectual property. We have broad discretion in determining how the proceeds of this offering will be used,<br />and our discretion is not limited by the aforementioned possible uses. Our board of directors believes the flexibility in application<br />of the net proceeds is prudent.<br />The expected use of proceeds from this<br />offering represent our current intentions based on present plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual<br />expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including our development and commercialization efforts, as well as the amount of<br />cash used in our operations. We therefore cannot estimate with certainty the amount of net proceeds to be used for the purposes<br />described above.

This calculation does not<br />reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of the warrants.<br />Our net tangible book value on June 30,<br />2018 was approximately $3.7 million," or $1.01 per share. \""""Net tangible book value\"""" is total assets minus the sum of<br />liabilities and intangible assets. \""""Net tangible book value per share\"""" is net tangible book value divided by the total<br />number of shares outstanding.<br />Our pro forma net tangible book value as<br />of June 30", 2018 was $15.5 million or $2.15 per share of common stock, based upon 7,208,320 shares outstanding, after giving effect<br />to issuances of 3,485,483 shares of common stock for which we received net proceeds of $11.8 million from July 1, 2018 through<br />and immediately prior to the date of this prospectus but does not reflect reductions in cash subsequent to June 30, 2018 as a result<br />of expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business. After giving effect to the sale by us of 2,520,000 Class A units in this<br />offering at a public offering price of $1.15 per Class A Unit,15,723 Class B Units at a public offering price of $1,000 per Class<br />B Unit and assuming that all Class B Units convert to 13,672,173 shares of common stock, and after deducting the estimated underwriting<br />discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of June 30, 2018 would<br />have been approximately $32.2 million, or approximately $1.38 per share. This represents an immediate decrease in pro forma<br />as adjusted net tangible book value of $0.77 per share to existing stockholders and an increase of $0.23 per share to new investors<br />purchasing Class A Units in this offering. The following table illustrates this per share dilution:<br />Public offering price per Class A Unit<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />$<br />1.15<br /> Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2018<br /> <br />$<br />2.15<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Decrease in pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering<br /> <br />$<br />(0.77<br />)<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />$<br />1.38<br /> Immediate increase in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value  per share to investors purchasing our common stock in this offering<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />$<br />0.23<br /> <br />The<br />information above and below assumes that all shares of Series B Preferred that are sold in this offering convert to 13,672,173<br />shares of common stock. The information above assumes that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option. If the<br />underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value would be $1.35 per<br />share, representing an immediate decrease to existing stockholders of $0.80 per share and an immediate increase in pro forma<br />as adjusted net tangible book value of $0.20 per share to new investors. <br />The foregoing discussion and table do<br />not take into account further dilution to new investors that could occur upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants<br />or conversion of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market<br />conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.<br />To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities," the issuance of these<br />securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders.<br />MARKET<br />FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS<br />Market Information<br />Our common stock has traded on the NYSE<br />American under the symbol \""""SYN\"""" since February 16", 2012. Prior to February 16,2012," our common stock traded under<br />the symbol \""""AEN\"""" since October 16", 2008. The following table states the range of the high and low sales prices of our<br />common stock for the year ended December 31,2016, and the year ended December 31, 2017 and the first and second fiscal quarter<br />of 2018 and for the third quarter through October 10, 2018 (as adjusted to reflect the one-for-thirty-five reverse stock split<br />effective August 10, 2018). These quotations represent inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, markdown, or commission, and<br />may not represent actual transactions. The last price of our common stock as reported on the NYSE American on October 8, 2018 was<br />$2.10 per share. As of October 10,2018, there were approximately 347 stockholders of record of our common stock. This number does<br />not include beneficial owners from whom shares are held by nominees in street name.<br />On August 1,2018, we announced a reverse<br />stock split of our shares of common stock at a ratio of one-for-thirty-five. The reverse stock split took effect at 11 p.m. (Eastern<br />Time) on August 10,2018, and our common stock began to trade on a post-split basis at the market open on August 13, 2018. When<br />the reverse stock split became effective, every 35 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one share<br />of common stock. Effecting the reverse stock split reduced the number of issued and outstanding common stock from approximately<br />132,969,743 shares to approximately 3,799,136. It also subsequently adjusted outstanding options issued under our equity incentive<br />plan, outstanding warrants to purchase common stock and our outstanding preferred stock.<br />  <br />High  <br />Low   <br />   <br />  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 <br />    <br />   First Quarter <br />$82.60  <br />$35.35 Second Quarter <br />$95.55  <br />$57.40 Third Quarter <br />$66.85  <br />$54.95 Fourth Quarter <br />$61.95  <br />$26.60   <br />    <br />   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 <br />    <br />   First Quarter <br />$36.05  <br />$20.65 Second Quarter <br />$26.25  <br />$14.35 Third Quarter <br />$36.75  <br />$16.10 Fourth Quarter <br />$33.60  <br />$17.50   <br />    <br />   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 <br />    <br />   First Quarter <br />$21.00  <br />$9.80 Second Quarter <br />$12.95  <br />$6.65 Third Quarter (through October 10, 2018) <br />$9.10  <br />$1.36 <br />DIVIDEND POLICY<br />We have never paid cash dividends on our<br />common stock. Moreover, we do not anticipate paying periodic cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We<br />intend to use all available cash and liquid assets in the operation and growth of our business, subject to terms of any preferred<br />stock or debt securities. Any future determination about the payment of dividends will be made at the discretion of our board<br />of directors and will be subject to the rights of any outstanding preferred stock and will depend upon our earnings, if any, capital<br />requirements, operating and financial conditions and on such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. The Series<br />A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of our common stock with respect to dividend rights and holders of Series A Preferred<br />Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 2.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, as set forth in the Certificate<br />of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock.<br />DESCRIPTION OF OUR<br />SECURITIES<br />Authorized Capital<br />Our authorized capital currently consists<br />of 200 million shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per<br />share. As of October 10,2018,7,208,320 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding, and 120,000 shares of preferred stock<br />were issued and outstanding.<br />Common Stock<br />We may issue shares of our common stock<br />from time to time. We currently have authorized 200,0,000 million shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share. We may<br />offer shares of common stock alone or underlying the registered securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock.<br />Voting. The holders of our common<br />stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including<br />the election of directors, and do not have cumulative voting rights. Accordingly, the holders of a majority of the shares of our<br />common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors can elect all of the directors standing for election.<br />Dividends. Subject to preferences<br />that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends,<br />if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds.<br />Liquidation. In the event of our<br />liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally<br />available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities, subject to the satisfaction<br />of any liquidation preference granted to the holders of any then outstanding shares of preferred stock.<br />Rights and Preferences. The holders<br />of our common stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions<br />applicable to our common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and<br />may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock that we may designate and<br />issue in the future.<br />Fully Paid and Nonassessable. All<br />of our outstanding shares of common stock are, and the shares of common stock to be issued under this prospectus will be, fully<br />paid and nonassessable.<br />In this prospectus," we have summarized<br />certain general features of our common stock under \""""Description of Our Securities-Common Stock\"""". We urge you",<br />however, to read the applicable prospectus supplement (and any related free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be provided<br />to you) related to any common stock being offered.<br />Preferred Stock<br />Our board of directors has the authority,<br />without action by our stockholders, to designate and issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series or<br />classes and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each series or class, which may be greater than the rights<br />of our common stock. It is not possible to state the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock upon the rights<br />of holders of our common stock until our board of directors determines the specific rights of the holders of the preferred stock.<br />However, the effects might include:<br /> <br />?<br />restricting dividends on our common stock;<br /> <br />?<br />diluting the voting power of our common stock;<br /> <br />?<br />impairing liquidation rights of our common stock; or<br /> <br />?<br />delaying or preventing a change in control of us without further action by our<br />stockholders.<br />The board of directors\' authority<br />to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of our<br />company, and could discourage such attempt. We have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.<br />Series A Preferred<br />We had 120,000 shares of Series A Preferred<br />Stock outstanding as of October 10, 2018.<br />The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior<br />to the shares of our common stock, and any other class or series of stock issued by us with respect to dividend rights, redemption<br />rights and rights on the distribution of assets on our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Holders<br />of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 2.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears,<br />as set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock classifying the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series<br />A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of common stock at a conversion price of<br />$18.90 per share (as adjusted to reflect the 1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10, 2018), subject to certain customary<br />anti-dilution adjustments.<br />Any conversion of Series A Preferred Stock<br />may be settled by us in shares of common stock only.<br />The holder\'s ability to convert<br />the Series A Preferred Stock into common stock is subject to (i) a 19.99% blocker provision to comply with NYSE American Listing<br />Rules, (ii) if so elected by the holder, a 4.99% blocker provision that will prohibit beneficial ownership of more than 4.99%<br />of our outstanding shares common stock or voting power at any time, and (iii) applicable regulatory restrictions.<br />In the event of our liquidation, dissolution<br />or winding-up," holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a preference on liquidation equal to the greater of (i)<br />an amount per share equal to the stated value plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A Preferred Stock<br />(the \""""Accreted Value\"""")", and (ii) the amount such holders would receive in such liquidation if they converted their<br />shares of Series A Preferred Stock (based on the Accreted Value and without regard to any conversion limitation) into shares of<br />the common stock immediately prior to any such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up (the greater of (i) and (ii)," is referred<br />to as the \""""Liquidation Value\"""").<br />Except as otherwise required by law", the<br />holders of Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights, other than customary protections against adverse amendments and issuance<br />of pari passu or senior preferred stock. Upon certain change of control events involving our company, we will be required<br />to repurchase all of the Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the Accreted Value and (ii)<br />the amount that would be payable upon a change of control (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) in respect of common<br />stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock<br />were converted into common stock immediately prior to the change of control.<br />On or at any time after (i) the VWAP (as<br />defined in the Certificate of Designation) for at least 20 trading days in any 30 trading day period is greater than $70.00 (as<br />adjusted to reflect the 1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10, 2018), subject to adjustment in the case of stock split,<br />stock dividends or the like we have the right, after providing notice not less than 6 months prior to the redemption date, to<br />redeem, in whole or in part, on a pro rata basis from all holders thereof based on the number of shares of Series A Preferred<br />Stock then held, the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, for cash, at a redemption price per share of Series A Preferred Stock<br />of $7,875.00 (as adjusted to reflect the 1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10, 2018), subject to appropriate adjustment<br />in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Series A Preferred<br />Stock, or (ii) the five year anniversary of the issue date, we have the right to redeem, in whole or in part, on a pro rata basis<br />from all holders thereof based on the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then held, the outstanding Series A Preferred<br />Stock, for cash, at a redemption price per share equal to the Liquidation Value.<br />Warrants<br />As of October 10,2018, we had issued and<br />outstanding warrants to purchase a total of 915,857 shares of our common stock outstanding at a weighted-average price of $75.16<br />(as adjusted to reflect the 1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10, 2018 without taking into account fractional shares<br />which are rounded up to the nearest whole number).<br />On November 18,2016, we completed a public<br />offering of 714,286 shares of common stock (as adjusted to reflect the 1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10, 2018)<br />in combination with accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,428,571 shares of the common stock(as adjusted to reflect<br />the 1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10, 2018), of which warrants to purchase 714,286 (as adjusted to reflect the<br />1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10," 2018 without taking into account fractional shares) shares of common stock are<br />outstanding (the \""""Series A Warrants\""""). The per share exercise price of the Series A Warrants is $50.05 (as adjusted<br />to reflect the 1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10", 2018) subject to further adjustment as specified in the warrant<br />agreements. The Series A Warrants may be exercised at any time until the four-year anniversary of the issuance date. The warrants<br />include a provision that if we were to enter into a certain transaction, as defined in the agreement, the warrants would be purchased<br />from the holder for cash.<br />On October 10,2014, we issued 14,59,616<br />units at a price of $1.47 per unit to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering, each unit consisted of<br />one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.5 shares of common stock. The warrants, exercisable for an aggregate<br />of 200,852 (as adjusted to reflect the 1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10, 2018 without taking into account fractional<br />shares) shares of common stock, have an exercise price of $61.25 per share (as adjusted to reflect the 1-for-35 reverse stock<br />split effected August 10, 2018) and a life of five years. The warrants vested immediately and expire on October 10, 2019.<br />Options<br />As of October 10,2018, options to purchase<br />an aggregate of 347,765 (as adjusted to reflect the 1-for-35 reverse stock split effected August 10," 2018 without taking<br />into account fractional shares) shares of common stock were outstanding under our equity incentive plans.<br />Stockholder Registration Rights<br />We are party to a registration rights<br />agreement (the \""""Registration Rights Agreement\"""") that provides the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock with certain<br />registration rights. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement", we agreed to file a registration statement covering<br />resales of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock with the SEC within 60 days following<br />receipt of a request at any time (as long as the requestor beneficially owns at least ten percent (10%) of our common stock then<br />outstanding or is otherwise deemed our affiliate) and to use reasonable best efforts to have the registration statement declared<br />effective within 120 days following receipt of such request.<br />We have agreed to pay certain penalties<br />if the registration statement is not declared effective by the SEC on or before the required deadline. After that deadline and<br />until such time as the registration statement is declared effective (or until we are no longer required to cause the registration<br />statement to be declared effective), we will be required to pay additional liquidated damages.<br />Pursuant to the terms of the registration<br />rights agreement that we entered into with Intrexon and an affiliated entity, we were required to file a registration statement<br />with respect to securities issued and are required to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement. The failure to<br />do so could result in the payment of damages by us. The registration statement was declared effective on April 29, 2013.<br />Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions<br />of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws<br />Our Articles of Incorporation, as amended,<br />and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that may have anti-takeover effects, making it more difficult for or<br />preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company or changing its board of directors and management. According to<br />our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation, neither the holders of our common stock nor the holders of any<br />preferred stock we may issue in the future have cumulative voting rights in the election of our directors. The lack of cumulative<br />voting makes it more difficult for other stockholders to replace our board of directors or for a third party to obtain control<br />of our company by replacing its board of directors.<br />Authorized but Unissued Shares<br />Our authorized but unissued shares of<br />common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuance without stockholder approval. We may use additional shares<br />for a variety of purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, to fund acquisitions and as employee<br />compensation. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult<br />or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer," merger or otherwise.<br />Anti-Takeover Effects of Nevada Law<br />Business Combinations<br />The \""""business combination\""""<br />provisions of Sections 78.411 to 78.444", inclusive," of the Nevada Revised Statute (the \""""NRS\"""") generally prohibit a<br />Nevada corporation with at least 200 stockholders from engaging in various \""""combination\"""" transactions with any interested<br />stockholder for a period of two years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder",<br />unless the transaction is approved by the board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder obtained such status<br />or the combination is approved by the board of directors and thereafter is approved at a meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative<br />vote of stockholders representing at least 60% of the outstanding voting power held by disinterested stockholders, and extends<br />beyond the expiration of the two-year period, unless:<br /> <br />·<br />the combination was approved by the board of directors prior to the person becoming<br />an interested stockholder or the transaction by which the person first became an interested stockholder was approved by the<br />board of directors before the person became an interested stockholder or the combination is later approved by a majority of<br />the voting power held by disinterested stockholders; or<br /> <br />·<br />if the consideration to be paid by the interested stockholder is at least equal<br />to the highest of: (a) the highest price per share paid by the interested stockholder within the two years immediately preceding<br />the date of the announcement of the combination or in the transaction in which it became an interested stockholder, whichever<br />is higher, (b) the market value per share of common stock on the date of announcement of the combination and the date the<br />interested stockholder acquired the shares, whichever is higher, or (c) for holders of preferred stock, the highest liquidation<br />value of the preferred stock," if it is higher.<br />A \""""combination\"""" is generally<br />defined to include mergers or consolidations or any sale", lease exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer, or other disposition, in<br />one transaction or a series of transactions," with an \""""interested stockholder\"""" having: (a) an aggregate market value<br />equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation", (b) an aggregate market value equal to 5%<br />or more of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation, (c) 10% or more of the earning power or net<br />income of the corporation, and (d) certain other transactions with an interested stockholder or an affiliate or associate of an<br />interested stockholder.<br />In general," an \""""interested stockholder\""""<br />is a person who", together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within two years, did own) 10% or more of a corporation\'s<br />voting stock. The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly," may<br />discourage attempts to acquire our company even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their<br />stock at a price above the prevailing market price.<br />Control Share Acquisitions<br />The \""""control share\"""" provisions<br />of Sections 78.378 to 78.3793", inclusive," of the NRS apply to \""""issuing corporations\"""" that are Nevada corporations<br />with at least 200 stockholders", including at least 100 stockholders of record who are Nevada residents, and that conduct business<br />directly or indirectly in Nevada. The control share statute prohibits an acquirer, under certain circumstances, from voting its<br />shares of a target corporation\'s stock after crossing certain ownership threshold percentages, unless the acquirer obtains<br />approval of the target corporation\'s disinterested stockholders. The statute specifies three thresholds: one-fifth or more<br />but less than one-third, one-third but less than a majority, and a majority or more, of the outstanding voting power. Generally,<br />once an acquirer crosses one of the above thresholds," those shares in an offer or acquisition and acquired within 90 days thereof<br />become \""""control shares\"""" and such control shares are deprived of the right to vote until disinterested stockholders<br />restore the right. These provisions also provide that if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person<br />has acquired a majority or more of all voting power", all other stockholders who do not vote in favor of authorizing voting rights<br />to the control shares are entitled to demand payment for the fair value of their shares in accordance with statutory procedures<br />established for dissenters\' rights.<br />A corporation may elect to not be governed<br />by," or \""""opt out\"""" of", the control share provisions by making an election in its articles of incorporation or bylaws,<br />provided that the opt-out election must be in place on the 10th day following the date an acquiring person has acquired a controlling<br />interest, that is, crossing any of the three thresholds described above.

For each Class B Unit we sell, the number of Class A Units<br />we are offering will be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Because we will issue a warrant as part of each Unit," the number<br />of warrants sold in this offering will not change as a result of a change in the mix of the Units sold.

No fractional shares of common stock will be issued in connection with the exercise of a warrant.<br />In lieu of fractional shares, we will pay the holder an amount in cash equal to the fractional amount multiplied by the fair market<br />value of any such fractional shares.<br />Exercise Limitations. Under the<br />warrants, we may not effect the exercise of any warrant, and a holder will not be entitled to exercise any portion of any warrant,<br />which, upon giving effect to such exercise, would cause (i) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned<br />by the holder (together with its affiliates) to exceed [4.99%/9.99%] of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately<br />after giving effect to the exercise, or (ii) the combined voting power of our securities beneficially owned by the holder (together<br />with its affiliates) to exceed [4.99%/9.99%] of the combined voting power of all of our securities then outstanding immediately<br />after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the warrants.<br />However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% upon at least 61 days\'<br />prior notice from the holder to us.<br />Exercise Price.

The underwriting agreement provides<br />that the obligations of the several underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the Units offered by this prospectus are subject<br />to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriter is obligated to purchase<br />all of the Units if any of the securities are purchased, other than those shares covered by the over-allotment option to purchase<br />additional securities described below.<br />Discount, Commissions and Expenses<br />The underwriters have advised us that they<br />propose to offer the Units to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and to certain<br />dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of $0.04025 per Unit.

We estimate that expenses payable by us in connection with this offering, including reimbursement of the underwriters<br />out-of-pocket expenses, but excluding the underwriting discount referred to above, will be approximately $600,000.<br />(1)The underwriter will receive a discount of 7% to the public offering price with respect to any Class A<br />Units or Class B Units purchased in this offering by investors. The underwriters have agreed to credit us $105,000 at the closing<br />with respect to sales made to a certain investor.<br />Option To Purchase Additional Shares and Warrants<br />We have granted to the underwriters an<br />over-allotment option exercisable not later than 45 days after the date of this prospectus to purchase up to 2,428,825 additional<br />shares of common stock (15% of the shares included in the Class A Units sold in this offering and the shares of common stock issuable<br />upon conversion of the Series B Preferred included in Class B Units sold in the offering) and/or warrants to purchase a maximum<br />of up to 2,428,825 additional shares of common stock from us to cover over-allotments, if any. If the underwriters exercise all<br />or part of this option, they will purchase such common stock covered by the option at the public offering price per Class A Unit,<br />minus once cent and the warrants covered by this option at a price of one cent per warrant, in each case less the underwriting<br />discounts and commissions. If this option is exercised in full, the total offering price to the public will be approximately $21.4<br />million and the total net proceeds, after expenses, to us will be approximately $19.9 million.<br />Indemnification<br />We have agreed to indemnify<br />the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and liabilities arising from breaches<br />of representations and warranties contained in the underwriting agreement, or to contribute to payments that the underwriters<br />may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.<br />Determination of Offering Price <br />The actual offering price of the securities we are offering<br />will be negotiated between us and the underwriter based on the trading of our shares of common stock prior to the offering, among<br />other things, and may be at a discount to the current market price.<br />Lock-up Agreements <br />We, our officers and<br />directors have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, for a period of 90 days after the date of the underwriting agreement, not<br />to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of, directly<br />or indirectly any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock either owned<br />as of the date of the underwriting agreement or thereafter acquired without the prior written consent of the representative. The<br />representative may, in its sole discretion and at any time or from time to time before the termination of the lock-up period,<br />without notice, release all or any portion of the securities subject to lock-up agreements.<br />Price Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids<br />The underwriter may engage in syndicate<br />covering transactions, stabilizing transactions and penalty bids or purchases for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining<br />the price of our shares of common stock:<br />·Syndicate<br />covering transactions involve purchases of securities in the open market after the distribution<br />has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. Such a naked short position<br />would be closed out by buying securities in the open market. A naked short position is<br />more likely to be created if the underwriter is concerned that there could be downward<br />pressure on the price of the securities in the open market after pricing that could adversely<br />affect investors who purchase in the offering.<br />·Stabilizing<br />transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing<br />bids do not exceed a specific maximum.<br />·Penalty<br />bids permit the underwriter to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when<br />the securities originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in a stabilizing<br />or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions.<br />These syndicate covering transactions,<br />stabilizing transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market prices of our securities or<br />preventing or retarding a decline in the market prices of our securities. As a result, the price of our shares of common stock<br />may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor the underwriter make any representation<br />or prediction as to the effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our shares of common stock. These<br />transactions may be effected on the NYSE American, in the over-the-counter market or on any other trading market and, if commenced,<br />may be discontinued at any time.<br />In connection with this offering, the<br />underwriter also may engage in passive market making transactions in our shares of common stock in accordance with Regulation M<br />during a period before the commencement of offers or sales of our shares of common stock in this offering and extending through<br />the completion of the distribution. In general, a passive market maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest<br />independent bid for that security. However, if all independent bids are lowered below the passive market maker\'s bid that<br />bid must then be lowered when specific purchase limits are exceeded. Passive market making may stabilize the market price of the<br />securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any<br />time.<br />Neither we nor the underwriter make any<br />representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on<br />the prices of our securities. In addition, neither we nor the underwriter make any representation that the underwriter will engage<br />in these transactions or that any transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.<br />Electronic Distribution <br />This prospectus in electronic format may<br />be made available on websites or through other online services maintained by one or more of the underwriters, or by their affiliates.<br />Other than this prospectus in electronic format, the information on any underwriter\'s website and any information contained<br />in any other website maintained by an underwriter is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus<br />forms a part, has not been approved and/or endorsed by us or any underwriter in its capacity as underwriter, and should not be<br />relied upon by investors.<br />Other<br />From time to time, certain of the underwriters<br />and/or their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking and other financial services<br />for us for which services they have received and, may in the future receive, customary fees.

e25f7ad9fc,Apparently There Is Hidden Meaning Behind The Joker\'s Tattoos In \'Suicide Squad\' - NME.com (blog),"The Hidden Meaning In The Joker\'s Tattoos<br />Plenty of reasons to be excited about Jared Leto as The Joker in the upcoming Suicide Squad[1], co-starring Margot Robbie and Will Smith, which is released next month.Apparently the actor stayed in character throughout the filming of the movie. Given that his character is a deranged, colourful psychopath, this resulted in some weird behaviour. Yes, he allegedly sent Margot Robbie a live rat in a black box. Of course he reportedly had a dead pig delivered to the cast. Naturally there have been stories that Jared Leto arranged for anal beads and used condoms to be posted to his colleagues. Will Smith told Beats 1: \""I\'ve only ever spoken to him with me as [my character] Deadshot and him as The Joker. I literally have not met him yet.\""So far, so exciting. Ah, but there\'s more. In an interview with Yahoo, director David Ayer has claimed there\'s reason to pay attention to The Joker\'s striking tattoos. \""The tattoos tell a very specific story\"", he said[2]. \""And eventually people will decipher them and understand what\'s going on, but obviously they\'re contentious, any time you do something new it\'s contentious. There\'s very specific stories and easter eggs in those tattoos. And even his teeth, there\'s an entire story behind that which is absolutely canon. It\'s putting his history on his body. This Joker is a little more working class, who I believe could live in our world.\""Ayers also said that the character\'s highly stylised look was inspired by \""drug lords on Instagram\"".

2e763c88bf,A time for choosing: socialism or fascism - RenewAmerica - RenewAmerica,"A time for choosing: socialism or fascism<br />By Cliff KincaidDonald J. Trump has a strange and unhealthy fascination with the \""strength\"" of those who pummel, terrorize, and kill people. At the Miami Republican debate, he stood by comments in support of the Communist Chinese dictatorship for killing protesters during a \""riot,\"" and he praised the leading killer in the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, for being \""strong.\"" Despite these shocking assertions, Trump was seen by some in the media as turning in a respectable or even \""presidential\"" performance. At least he didn\'t talk about his body parts or use obscenities.Once again, according to Trump\'s leading media cheerleader, the Drudge Report, the New York businessman won the debate. Drudge said he got 63 percent in an online survey, versus 24 percent for Senator Ted Cruz.It seemed bizarre to me. But in a matter-of-fact manner, moderator Jake Tapper noted that Trump has been criticized for \""praising authoritarian dictators.\"" He quoted[2] Trump as saying about China\'s massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, \""When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.\""Despite the clear meaning of his words, Trump lamely replied, \""That doesn\'t mean I was endorsing that.\"" He added, \""I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing.\""Ohio Governor John Kasich had the Reaganite response. He said, \""I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front - that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government.\"" He was referring to the famous picture of a pro-democracy demonstrator standing in front of a Chinese tank.The estimates[3] of the dead in Tiananmen Square range from several hundred to more than 2,000.President Reagan wasn\'t president at the time, but his partner in foreign affairs, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said she was \""appalled by the indiscriminate shooting of unarmed people.\"" The French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, was quoted as saying that he was \""dismayed by the bloody repression\"" of \""an unarmed crowd of demonstrators.\""Today, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination is defending the \""strong, powerful government that put it down with strength.\"" At the same time, he\'s critical of U.S. allies around the world now facing threats from the Russians, the Chinese and the North Koreans. Trump said, \""...we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take - every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing.\"" It\'s a lie, of course. In fact, the South Koreans have a \""burden sharing agreement[4]\"" with the U.S. under which they paid $861 million last year.Trump seems to have no interest in maintaining America\'s strategic alliances, throwing into doubt the survival of tens of millions of people who depend on the United States for their freedom.Under a President Trump, there could be another domino-theory scenario, with American allies falling like dominoes around the world. In the Middle East, because Trump wants to pursue a strategic alliance with Russia, we are likely to see NATO member Turkey fall to Russian aggression, and the Saudi oil fields would then be a major target of the Russian-Iranian military axis. Israel comes after that.At the debate, Trump said, \""As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn\'t mean I\'m endorsing Putin.\"" Oh, really? He has defended Putin against charges that the Russian dictator kills people, saying, \""we kill a lot of people, too.\"" He gladly accepted Putin\'s support for his candidacy. \""When people call you \'brilliant\' it\'s always good, especially when the person heads up Russia,\"" Trump said[5].It\'s bad enough that he admires \""strong\"" foreign leaders who carry out military aggression and kill their political opponents. His own campaign has now been accused of wrestling a young female reporter named Michelle Fields[6] to the ground and bruising her arm. She worked for Breitbart News, a media organization named for the conservative journalist, Andrew Breitbart, who won the Reed Irvine Journalism Award[7] for confronting the political and media establishments. Ironically, most of the editors and reporters at Breitbart News have been promoting the Donald J. Trump candidacy. They\'ve been forced to come to grips with what happened to their own reporter, a development that may or may not cause them to reconsider their support of the New York businessman. After the debate, Trump said he didn\'t believe Fields had been manhandled by his staff.This incident, which was not brought up during the Miami debate, occurred after a protester was sucker punched by a man during a Trump rally. The Trump supporter has been charged with assault and was quoted as saying that, next time, the protester should be killed.Robert Zubrin, who has written[8] on why the Kremlin is openly backing Trump for U.S. president, told me during a recent interview that \""Trump constantly talks about strength. He never talks about liberty.\"" It is a telling observation. He says Trump is offering America \""strong man rule.\"" He made these comments before the Republican debate in Miami, and the physical confrontations with Fields and the anti-Trump protester. Trump says he does not condone the violence, but he seems to encourage physical confrontations at his rallies. His cult-like followers pledge personal allegiance to him.In this context, Zubrin noted, Trump re-tweeted a quote from the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. The quote was, \""It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.\"" Trump called it \""a very good quote.\"" Zubrin asserts, \""Trump actually imitates the gestures of Mussolini, upturned chin and so forth.\"" Not willing to hide his opinions, Zubrin believes Trump is a fascist, or a national socialist.As the incident with Fields demonstrates, it appears that Trump and his campaign want to muscle the press and anybody else who gets in his way. The use of muscle has mostly been unnecessary until now. The Trump campaign has had the media feeding out of their hands. However, Trump has threatened lawsuits against the Cruz campaign and the Club for Growth for running ads. Trump\'s lawyers sent a \""cease-and-desist\"" letter demanding that the Cruz campaign take down a campaign ad showing Trump on \""Meet the Press\"" in 1999 saying, \""I am pro-choice in every respect,\"" and adding that he would not ban partial-birth abortion.In other words, Trump didn\'t want the America people to be informed about his own previous positions on this issue. How\'s that for someone about to get the nomination of a political party that claims to be for individual freedom and freedom of expression?In the Fields case, the behavior by the Trump campaign seems to be somewhat similar to the case of Melissa Click, the University of Missouri professor who was fired for blocking a journalist\'s access to a left-wing protest. \""Hey, who wants to help me get this reporter out of here?\"" Click was caught saying. \""I need some muscle over here.\""These totalitarian tendencies can be found on the right and left. During the Democratic Party debate with Hillary Clinton, presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) refused to disavow his support of the Castro dictatorship. Trump hasn\'t said so, but perhaps he, too, respects the Castro brothers for being \""strong\"" leaders like Putin and the Communist Chinese.Zubrin, the author of Merchants of Despair[9], noted with concern that Trump has already announced that he wants to \""open up\"" newspapers and other media to lawsuits for saying bad things about political and government officials. Trump says[10], \""One of the things I\'m going to do if I win, and I hope we do and we\'re certainly leading. I\'m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. We\'re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\'re totally protected.\""Our media are \""protected\"" by the First Amendment, designed to encourage a diversity of voices and hold government accountable.Zubrin said Trump seems to think \""our press is too free,\"" and that \""we don\'t have enough lawsuits.\""In fact, without these proposed changes, Trump and others like him can still sue the press, and he has done so.Trump in the past filed suit against a New York Times reporter who wrote a book that Trump said had misrepresented his net worth. Trump considered this malicious. Trump had demanded $5 billion in damages and spent $1 million in legal fees over a five year period before the case was thrown out. The Washington Post reported[11] that Trump said in an interview that he knew he couldn\'t win the case but pursued it anyway just to make the reporter\'s life miserable. Trump said he was \""happy\"" about it.\""America does not need a dictator,\"" Zubrin told me. \""That\'s one thing we don\'t need. So it\'s almost beside the point what his positions on the issues are. His ultimate position is he wants to be a strong man backed by a mob.\""And the party of Reagan and Lincoln is about to nominate this guy? It\'s no wonder that conservative journalist Fred Barnes predicts[12] that conservatives will launch their own candidate for president if Trump wins the Republican presidential nomination.America will never be the same. In fact, the country that Ronald and Nancy Reagan loved has already changed in very disturbing ways. Both major political parties seem to be having a fascination with adherents of totalitarian ideologies - Bernie Sanders on the left and Donald J. Trump on the right. Whatever happens to Sanders, he has already pushed Hillary Clinton further to the left. The Democratic Party has already become a vehicle for imposing socialism on the American people.On the other side, if the Republican Party accepts Trump as its nominee, it may be finished as a major party, as conservatives desert the GOP and regroup under a different banner. It truly is a time for choosing.© Cliff Kincaid[1]References^ Cliff Kincaid (news.google.com)^ quoted (www.cnn.com)^ estimates (www.nytimes.com)^ burden sharing agreement (www.aim.org)^ said (www.nbcnews.com)^ Michelle Fields (www.breitbart.com)^ Reed Irvine Journalism Award (www.aim.org)^ written (www.weeklystandard.com)^ Merchants of Despair (merchantsofdespair.net)^ says (www.politico.com)^ reported (www.washingtonpost.com)^ predicts (www.aim.org)<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHIusg91sy0zzWo3_7X43NlQWoUOg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779061231971&ei=5HDmVvi6CYao1gaux5PYCA&url=http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/kincaid/160314,EN,,14/03/2016 08:07,2016-03-14 02:24:25+00:00,95c728a7b8,RenewAmerica,,,,,1457925865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ff2077995b,Could a mass vaccination programme to eradicate bluetongue be on the cards - Irish Independent,"Could a mass vaccination programme to eradicate bluetongue be on the cards<br />Mass vaccination programmes lasting at least five years in combination with improved, continuous surveillance systems would be the only effective measures for eradicating bluetongue in Europe, The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded.<br />Its experts have reviewed control measures for bluetongue and options for safe trade of animals from infected to free areas, following a request from the European Commission.<br />Bluetongue is a vector-borne viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants such as sheep, goats, cattle and deer. It is transmitted through the bites of certain species of Culicoides midgeAccording to the EFSA, the eradication of bluetongue is very difficult and it says at least five consecutive years of vaccination covering 95% of susceptible cattle and sheep would be needed.<br />It also says such mass vaccination campaigns would have to be followed by sensitive surveillance systems capable of detecting low levels of virus prevalence - lower than 1% of animals in a monitored area.The disease could otherwise re-appear some years after completion of the vaccination campaign, the experts said.<br />Surveillance systems should be defined on a case-by-case basis taking into account aspects such as the geographical area monitored and the epidemiological phase of the disease.EFSA experts also highlighted that:",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHkI5Pt4hjwjAA7CXNgBXpQ6KTwfw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=N17CWNC-GoPwzAbm2ruYAQ&url=http://www.independent.ie/business/farming/beef/could-a-mass-vaccination-programme-to-eradicate-bluetongue-be-on-the-cards-35518328.html,EN,,10/03/2017 08:08,2017-03-10 06:51:24+00:00,7e768e403e,Irish Independent,,,,,1489132284,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ff44bec7c5,"Yes, your dog can get the flu, too: How to protect your furry friend - WTOP","Yes, your dog can get the flu, too: How to protect your furry friend<br />(NEW YORK) - Amid the deadly flu outbreak hitting nearly every state in the U.S., even your furry best friend is not immune to the flu.<br />Canine influenza A H3N2 virus, or dog flu[1], was identified in the U.S. in 2015 and has infected dogs in nearly every state since then.<br />Dog flu is different from the strain of influenza that affects humans. All U.S. states except Hawaii are reporting widespread flu activity this season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />Just as humans spread the flu through close contact, flu is spread among dogs when they bark at each other or sneeze or cough in proximity. Dogs that spend time in places like kennels, dog parks and boarding centers are the most at risk for catching the flu, experts said.<br />Officials at Cornell University\'s College of Veterinary Medicine reported cases of dog flu across the country. Their research, done on a voluntary basis, currently shows several active areas of transmission in the U.S.: southern Ohio and northeastern Tennessee, as well as the San Jose and greater San Francisco Bay areas.<br />\""It\'s unpredictable how this happens and really depends on when a dog who has been exposed to influenza gets introduced to an environment where the virus can easily spread,\"" said Dr. Amy Glaser, director of Cornell\'s Molecular Diagnostics Animal Health Diagnostic Center.<br />Symptoms of the flu to look for in your dog include a persistent cough, sneezing and high fever, reduced appetite and discharge from the eyes, the CDC said. Not all dogs, however, show signs of the illness.<br />If your dog is showing symptoms, Glaser recommended taking your dog to a veterinarian office to get tested. If the test is positive, the dog may be prescribed medication to fight secondary infections or fluids to restore hydration.<br />Though dog flu is a \""serious respiratory illness,\"" most dogs will recover without any treatment beyond good nutrition and rest, Glaser said.<br />There is a canine influenza vaccine that will not prevent infection but may decrease the severity of illness, according to Glaser. The vaccine is primarily intended to protect dogs at greater risk, such as \""socially active dogs\"" and those kept in group facilities.<br />The fatality rate for dog flu is less than 10 percent, the AVMA reported. Most dogs recover in two to three weeks.<br />Dogs diagnosed with H3N2 must be isolated for 21 days, according to Glaser. Pet owners must take care to wash their hands and change their clothes after caring for the dog because the virus could be transmitted through them to other pets in the home.<br />And while there is no indication the dog flu can cause human illness, dogs, as well as cats, can contract the human flu virus. Pet owners should distance themselves from their pets when sick, Glaser recommended.<br />\""If you have the flu, don\'t kiss your dog,\"" she said.<br />Copyright © 2018, ABC Radio.

ff5346682a,"Sandwich Breads, Ranked - Deadspin","Sandwich Breads, Ranked<br />Illustration by Angelica Alzona.<br />Time for your weekly edition of the Deadspin Funbag. Got something on your mind? Email the Funbag. Today, we\'re covering sandwich breads, unemployment, the Beatles, and more.[1]<br />Hey yo, the book tour for The Hike[2] continues its drunken march down the West Coast tonight with a reading in Portland, and then two more stops in the Bay Area after that. So come on out and don\'t be weird about it.<br />All right, time for your letters:<br />Alex:<br />What is the best sandwich bread? Obviously some of this depends on what you\'re pairing it with, but I think squaw is badass and completely under used.<br />It must be because I have no idea what squaw bread is. Does it have bits of real squaw in it? That sounds problematic[3]. Dan Snyder probably serves squaw bread when lobbying Virginia stadium officials.<br />Anyway, these rankings are probably gonna start a fight because everyone loves pointlessly arguing about food online, so let\'s get right to it.<br />Sub roll. Pretty much all my favorite sandwiches use sub rolls as the preferred meat vessel: Italian subs with quintuple meat, dipped roast beef sandwiches, etc. I want a sub roll fifty yards long, cut into five ten-yard pieces, and I wanna eat it all in one sitting. That\'s a fine lunch. In heaven, they park you in front of a sub that has no end to it. It is the forever sub.Potato rolls. You can use them for burgers or sliders or pulled pork or anything else you want. They\'re impossible to fuck up.Big ass round loaf of overpriced French or Italian bread. There\'s a kind of bread they sell at Whole Foods for like $90 a loaf, and even though I curse those prices to the goddamn moon, the bread is REALLY good. It\'s crusty on the outside and spongy on the inside and when you butter it up it melts and gets all into the nooks and OH GOD I MUST HAVE IT. Any fresh bread made by some bearded artisanal nutjob who gets up at 3am every morning just to check on his yeast samples is usually gonna make for a good sandwich.Baguette. You gotta eat it right when you buy it, though. After three hours exposed to daylight, a Baguette turns into a Louisville Slugger.Ciabatta. You can buy half-baked Ciabatta rolls now at the store, which you then take home and shove in the oven to complete the breadmaking process. This way, I get to feel as if I baked the bread myself, even though that\'s a lie. One whiff from the oven and suddenly I am Enzo, The Baker.Split-top hot dog bun. I\'m gonna sidestep the \""is a hot dog a sandwich?\"" flame war for this part. All I know is that if you\'re having a lobster roll or a crab roll or something like that, it\'s real nice when it shows up in a split-top bun that\'s been slathered in butter and griddled on either side. I would eat a human turd out of one.English muffin. Like, with egg and bacon and cheese and extra bacon inside? OH SHIT YEAH. The nice thing is that English Muffins are relatively small, so I have no problem ordering seven breakfast sandwiches and pretending it\'s the equivalent of one standard-sized sandwich. They\'re like hor deuvres, really.Pita. Last week I got a garbage lamb gyro from a Halal cart in Midtown Manhattan and brought it back to my hotel room and it was the BEST. You could have told me they cooked the meat directly on the asphalt and I wouldn\'t have cared. The pita fell apart instantly (like it always does) but I didn\'t mind because I was so busy tearing into the thing and licking the foil. If there had been surveillance footage of me and this gyro alone in the hotel, people would have been horrified by it.Kaiser roll. Preferred bread of the guy in front of you at the New York deli who has an order for fifty sandwiches for his construction crew scrawled out on a torn-off cardboard box flap. YEAH JOHNNY\'LL HAVE THE FUCKING EGG-AND-CHEESE.Rye. Kids fear and loathe rye and adults go apeshit for it. One day, they\'re gonna do a study to determine the exact age where the Rye Transition happens. I think it\'s probably around age 18. Prior to that, I avoided rye bread like it had worms in it.Sourdough. Like regular white bread, but with a TWIST!Poppy seed roll. For when you get bored of Kaiser rolls.Croissant. I like sandwiches and I like croissants but a croissant sandwich usually results in a crumb bukkake all over my goddamn lap. Also, you only need to apply the gentlest of pressure to a croissant to have it flatten out into a millimeter-thick wad, so that\'s a problem. I need a small fairy to hand-feed me the croissant burger so that it maintains its integrity.Biscuit. Same problem. Biscuits are fucking awesome. Breakfast biscuits crumble after one bite. They\'re as structurally sound as a Trump building. I mean, I like foraging for the greasy crumbs and stuffing them back in my face like a complete savage, but still. Sometimes there are children watching.Pretzel Bun. Every time I see one on a menu, I turn into your grandma at brunch. OH THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING!Regular pumpernickel. Seems fine.Some multigrain shit with lots of seeds in it. Whoa hey, what did I just bite into? Was that a currant?Bagel. Bagel sandwiches are bullshit. They\'re always too thick to properly bite into, and then you have the issue of stuff falling out from the hole in the center: shreds of lettuce, drops of sauce, etc. Bagels weren\'t really meant for this.Wheat bread. BUT IT MUST USE WHOLE GRAIN WHEAT FLOUR AND NOT REFINED FLOUR! Or so I am ordered every time I go to the grocery store. Refined flour is apparently Satan\'s Anal Dust.Wonder bread. Just how I like my bread: flavorless and unhealthy. By the way, go ahead and move this up if we\'re talking about grilled cheese sandwiches only.Focaccia. What is this, 1989? Get the fuck out of here with that. \""We serve all our sandwiches on partially cooked, overly thick pizza crust.\""Flavored Wrap. Like, the tomato one? No.Thick, European pumpernickel. You know the one I\'m talking about. I don\'t mean the normal, Pepperidge Farm stuff. I\'m talking about the weird Swedish pumpernickel that looks like it was made out of black cork. That shit\'s repulsive. I don\'t get it, man. Europe has a lot of problems but their affinity for pumpernickel bread that has the density of a moon rock might be the worst of them.Liam:<br />Sometimes when I\'m wearing socks around the house and go to express myself urinarily, if I get some pee on the rim of the bowl, I\'ll just lift up my leg and wipe the rim off with my sock, then go about my business as if nothing happened. Is this widely-practiced boorish male behavior, or am I uniquely disgusting for doing this?<br />That\'s disgusting. Don\'t do that. It\'s not like if you see one drop of piss on the FLOOR and you know you can\'t leave it there because your wife might spot it. So you glance over it with your sock so that you avoid having to stoop over to wipe it up with a tissue. That\'s all fine. But I draw the line at cleaning the rim, man. You\'re better than that. You ever seen the rim of a toilet? It\'s the mouth of hell. There are urine specks on there that date back to 1965. Don\'t put your socks on it.<br />Also, feel free to use your Wigwams to wipe up any minor kitchen drops: water, milk, etc. Sometimes I get too cocky and wipe up a BIG spill, and that\'s when the shame and regret come flooding in. Oh God, what have I done? Real tough moment.<br />Matt:<br />So I\'m watching the men\'s gymnastics Olympic stuff and was wondering how you would rank the events in terms of difficulty. Floor exercise and vault, though I imagine still difficult, would be at the bottom. Rings, parallel bars, high bar (horizontal bar) and the dreaded pommel horse would be the top 4 (not necessarily in that order). I guess rings would be most difficult although I\'ve seen a few dudes bite the chalk on that high bar. <br />RINGS. It has to be rings. Just hanging from the rings is difficult. Go try it. Once you take your feet off the ground, you feel like your arms are about to be torn off. I experience physical pain watching male gymnasts hop on the rings and lower their arms parallel to the mat. It\'s like watching the training sequences from Bloodsport. No thanks. <br />I would put the pommel horse second, because it seems like gymnasts are always on the verge of banging their testicles on the handles of the horse. The part where they scissor their legs and let their balls dance around near them really concerns me. After that, I would go high bar, vault, floor stuff*, and then parallel bars. Parallel bars are bullshit. It looks like you\'re doing hospital rehab after a car accident. I don\'t know why they don\'t do away with the parallel bars and make the high bar into two uneven bars instead, like the women. I wanna Sergio flip around from one bar to the other. <br />Oh, and one more thing about men\'s gymnastics: why do they wear have to wear pants for some events? Why can\'t they can\'t just be in compression shorts and bare feet? These poor bastards have to go around in footies because their pants will ride up on them the second they do a flip. It\'s not right. This isn\'t storytime. Let them wear shorts. CARGO SHORTS.<br />(*The floor for floor exercises is equipped with springs underneath, like a wrestling ring. Any time I take my kid to some gymnastics practice, I make a point of bouncing around on that spring floor. It\'s awesome. All floors should have springs. I see no downside to the idea.)<br />Ben:<br />I just graduated from college and I\'m back at home, unemployed and searching for a job. This is extremely depressing, as my days consist of applying to 5-10 jobs and sulking around. I realize that, even though I am currently a money sucking leech, a resident toad agitating the quaint pond of my parents abode, there could be an upside to my current situation. Unfortunately, I do not see any upside. What are some schweet things I should be doing during my free time (which is all the time) that I won\'t be able to do once I\'m boarded up in an office, no longer sucking at the teat of an upper middle class upbringing?<br />Well, that\'s the bitch of being unemployed: all that free time doesn\'t FEEL like free time, because you know that you have to get a job at the end of it. It\'s not relaxing at all. I\'ve been unemployed for long stretches and the toll it takes on your psyche is real. You start to feel worthless. And the longer you go without finding a job, the worse you feel about having nothing to do. Like, you can go to a movie during the day and then go have a beer and treat the day as a \""day off,\"" but your employment status will always be at the back of your mind, nagging at you.<br />Oddly enough, the best thing you can do during this phase is \""work,\"" which means setting regular office hours to send out resumes and all that. But also, you should use those office hours to work on independent projects as well, even if they don\'t go anywhere: writing a movie script, researching a small business plan (Prestige Worldwide!), taking online courses, re-selling pot at a small markup, etc. Even if those projects go nowhere, you\'ll still feel like you \""worked,\"" which then makes you more like you deserve to kick back and relax later that night. It\'s a necessary bulwark against despair. Everyone needs a routine. Everyone needs structure. <br />HALFTIME!<br />Kurt:<br />Which is the worst to accidentally touch: used Band-Aid, used cotton swab, or used tissue?<br />The Band Aid, because at least there are parts of the old Kleenex that weren\'t used. There may be a bloody snotball in the dead center of the wad, but you can daintily pick up the tissue at the very edge and then rush it over to the trash can like a good, uptight citizen.<br />But every part of a used Band Aid is disgusting. The pad itself is usually stained with dried blood and yellowed pus. And then the rest of it is all sticky. There could be butt hair on those flaps, man. Even when I fold the Band Aid so that the flaps cover the pad, I still hate picking that shit up because the herpes could come rampaging THROUGH the little holes and then get all over me. It\'s not right.<br />Also, when you have kids, there are used Band-Aids everywhere: bathrooms, playgrounds, in the car, stuck to the carpet, in the dryer, you name it. They just rip them off and walk away, like criminals. It\'s disgusting. There\'s probably a Band Aid in my sandwich as we speak.<br />Connor:<br />What is the break-even distance for which an average guy on a bike would tie a world-class runner? My friends and I were debating this. We came to the consensus of about a quarter mile, as the sprinter would get out to a considerable lead as the average guy began peddling.<br />A sprinter wouldn\'t be much of a problem. Your average beginning cyclist can go about 10-15 mph on a flat surface, while Usain Bolt\'s top recorded speed was nearly 28 mph (HOLY SHIT!). So yeah, Bolt could get out to a quick lead on you, but then he would wear down quickly and you could pass him after a couple laps around the track, maybe sooner. Humans were not designed to run that fast for long stretches.<br />BUT... the world record marathon speed is right around 13mph. So it\'s possible that your sorry ass would be neck-and-neck with some Kenya distance running dynamo for miles and miles, until YOU broke down from exhaustion and got ultimately smoked. It\'s possible! When it comes to you versus an Olympian, I will almost always side with the Olympian, regardless of handicap.<br />Also, I haven\'t ridden a bike in ages, so I know I\'d tire out quickly. My thighs would chafe and develop large boils. Swamp-ass would set in at mile two. It would be a real issue. This is why I\'ve yet to lose my Citibike virginity.<br />Gary:<br />If Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr wanted to get together and play a show with a bunch of backing musicians, could they call themselves the Beatles? If not, when did they cease being able to call themselves that? When John Lennon died? When does any band cease being the original group? Are they still the Eagles without Glenn Frey?<br />Sure, they could go on tour as \""The Beatles\"" so long as they got permission from the estates of John Lennon and George Harrison. That\'s unlikely, but it could be done. In theory, you don\'t even need Paul or Ringo. You could clear out the legal red tape and have a band of random assholes tour as \""The Beatles\"" forever and ever if all the original parties and estates agreed to it. <br />Would that really be The Beatles up there on stage? No. Of course not. But once your band becomes a global sensation, it becomes a BRAND, an entity, and not just a specific group of people. And that brand name can become more valuable than the individual band members. It also becomes a huge legal concern if/when the lead singer decides to start boning the lead guitarist\'s wife and what not. Sometimes the brand becomes too valuable to ever die off, which is how you end up with \""Journey\"" touring minus Steve Perry, or Mike Love touring with five bags of flour and calling it \""The Beach Boys.\"" Those are bullshit bands and everyone knows it. But as long as they make money, any band can be any band.<br />Brian:<br />What website do you instinctively go to in order to check if the internet is working? And what does that say about an individual? <br />I used to go to Google because Google\'s homepage is still very basic, which allows it to load quickly. But I stopped doing that because sometimes that Google page loads but the rest of the Internet still won\'t. This is because Google has a shrink ray that allows them to send very small employees directly into your computer via fiber-optic cable to spy on you and load the Google homepage from within. They will not let a downed network prevent them from watching you masturbate.<br />Anyway, with that option out of the way, I usually try to bring up Gmail or Twitter, just like I do on my phone when the web is down. I can\'t tell you the number of times I\'ve dragged down my inbox with my finger, trying to will new emails into existence. WORK, GOD DAMN YOU. WORK. I could probably stand to go camping for a night or something.<br />Jacob:<br />I would guess that over 50% of the flights I\'ve been on I\'ve seen someone order tomato juice and drink it plain but I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen anyone order tomato juice anywhere else, ever (that is without alcohol and not in some kind of health smoothie). Is tomato juice drunk exclusively on airplanes? If so, this is doubly true for spicy tomato juice right?<br />Are you sure they\'re not dumping a couple of mini-bottles of vodka into that juice? Because people drink like fish on airplanes, especially designated morning cocktails like Bloody Marys and mimosas. Those are functional cocktails. You\'re supposed to be able to drink ten of them and still be able to work the booth at the Cattle Ranchers Of America annual convention once you land.<br />Flying has an adverse effect on the human body. It dries out your eyes. It saps you of energy and vital nutrients. It\'s terrible for your back. To counter all this damage, I assume a handful of people (but not many) will drink plain tomato juice to help with their vitamin intake. I am not one of those people. Tomato juice is fucking disgusting. I\'d rather drink strawberry urine.<br />Leon:<br />I\'ve never tried oatmeal in my life, and have absolutely no plans to. I catch a lot of shit for this but I\'ve always had better options for breakfast and can\'t imagine a scenario where oatmeal is my best recourse. Am I a terrible person?<br />What if your options are just oatmeal and dry cereal? Sometimes, on a cold winter morning, it\'s nice to cozy up with a bowl of oatmeal topped with fifty pounds of brown sugar. I like to pretend I\'m a starving English peasant who has been taken in by a Lord and fed a bowl of hot, nourishing gruel. THANK YOU, KIND SIR.<br />But yeah, if you\'re at a diner or some dipshit upscale breakfast joint, you\'re probably better off ordering eggs and bacon than some overpriced bowl of oatmeal that probably isn\'t even that good for you. Every moment you pass on eggs and bacon is a moment wasted. <br />Here\'s what I would say: You should at least TRY oatmeal.[4] And not the microwave garbage that comes in little packets. Have real, homemade oatmeal. Check it off your bucket list, so that you have a legit reason for passing on it. Don\'t avoid oatmeal all your life and be PROUD of it. That\'s not an Olympic feat. <br />Marc:<br />For months I\'ve been hearing all stories about how bad the Olympic prep has been, and how bad it might be for the host population/athletes/visitors. But now it\'s almost here, and I can\'t help but get excited for the spectacle we\'re all used to. I\'m a sucker for the inspiration, the intrigue, and the joy of all the sport. I worry that enjoying those things validates all the contemptible forces that helped bring the event to a place that won\'t be helped by it. Does it mean anything if I boycott the Olympics or the World Cup? Would it mean anything if we all did?<br />No, and you\'d never be able to arrange a widespread boycott anyway. That\'s why the IOC makes billions and billions of dollars. They are stewards of a property that, like NFL Football and the World Cup, is bulletproof. They can hire slaves and rip off countries and all that shit and they KNOW you\'ll still watch because A) it\'s fun, and B) you care about the athletes. <br />That\'s the key. The athletes are a human shield for the IOC. Sure, you may want to boycott the Games because of their treachery, but then what if they\'re cancelled and little Bobbi Sue never gets her shot at a canoeing medal? That\'s the beauty of the scam. There are ALWAYS innocents involved in the mix, and that\'s what allows to bad guys to slip away.<br />Joel:<br />Going to a friend\'s place this weekend and it is largely BYOB. Most people will bring a case of beer and a bottle of liquor. My question is, can I bring an already open bottle? I have a bottle I bought a couple weeks back that I haven\'t gotten into too much and don\'t feel like buying a brand new one. What\'s the etiquette here?<br />You can\'t. Like, if you\'re 23 years old and you\'re just going over to your boy\'s to get shitfaced and watch a football game, sure. Bring that half-empty bottle of Captain Morgan. But if it\'s a real adult party, you gotta bring a full bottle. Otherwise I don\'t know where the rest of that bottle has been. What if there\'s backwash? What if you used half of that bottle of Bulleit for a self-administered whiskey enema? And how long has it been sitting around? You gotta bring a sealed bottle. The only exception would be if you had some $5,000 bottle of Pappy or some shit and you were passing it around as a special treat.<br />Also, if you bring a six-pack, it\'s gotta be intact. You can\'t drink one can the night before and then hand it over with an empty ring. That\'s a real limp move, like giving someone a half-eaten cookie. I would think less of you.<br />Dave:<br />Will playing cards ever be forgotten? With phones and tablets and such becoming more ever-present, will some little post-millennial shits ever not know what the hell playing cards are? Y\'know, aside from stupid solitaire apps.<br />No way. As long as there\'s gambling, there will be cards. And gambling\'s not going anywhere. Virtual reality could eclipse everything and you could spend 20 hours a day living inside the O.A.S.I.S., but there will still be plenty of drunk frat bros playing Asshole and shady-looking Russian dudes in mirrored shades hanging out by casino tables. You\'ll never make playing cards extinct. They\'re timeless.<br />By the way, I have no clue when I need to start teaching my kids about cards. Cards are cheap entertainment but I haven\'t gotten around to teaching them solitaire or blackjack or gin rummy or anything yet. I feel like there\'s not enough gambling advice out there for parents. Someone guide me.<br />Email of the week!<br />Jake:<br />What is the cutest, most cuddly animal that you would NOT want to cuddle with because it\'s also the most deadly? Off the top of my head I\'m going with a polar/grizzly bear.<br />Panda! Gotta be the panda. They\'ll fuck you up.

ff6d32c596,Hayward: Who Need the \'Resistance\' When You\'ve Got the GOP Writing the Budget? - Breitbart News,"Hayward: Who Needs the \'Resistance\' When You\'ve Got the GOP Writing the Budget?<br />SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhy does the left bother with \""Resistance\"" theatrics when the Republican Congress funds their entire wish list anyway? <br />That\'s a bit of a trick question because the left still plans to seize more power and money by recapturing Congress and the White House. They\'ll never stop attacking the legitimacy of the Trump administration. The only lingering mystery is why so many Republicans think they can counter this strategy by appeasing Democrats. <br />At a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars in other people\'s money, Republicans purchase a couple of sound bites that allow them to claim they aren\'t heartless monsters because they funded every left-wing priority, from \""sanctuary cities\"" to Planned Parenthood. [1]<br />In reality, these capitulations don\'t win Republicans anything. Democrats will still depict them as tightwads on welfare spending, reactionaries on social policy, and footmen to the evil rich. As soon as the Republican \""leaders\"" who meekly funded 100 percent of the Democrat agenda for 2017 object to 20, 30, or 50 percent increases in that agenda, they will be denounced as greedy pigs who want poor people to die. <br />We won\'t even have to wait that long because Democrats are already cranking up the class-warfare machine to defeat Trump\'s tax reform proposals. How can any GOP leader be dense enough to think that caving to the Democrats on spending will secure their cooperation, or even slightly mute their objections, for dramatic pro-growth tax reform? <br />Indeed, the flabby bulk of these trillion-dollar spending deals will be used as an argument against tax cuts. How can Republicans propose cutting taxes after they just agreed to finance the entire Democrat wish list? Tax cuts are the one thing we\'re told we can never, ever \""afford.\""<br />The GOP appears to have given up on even the minimal fiscal responsibility of serious budgeting. From here on in, we\'ll have nothing but bloated omnibus spending bills, crammed with pork and passed in a feverish haze of shutdown panic. You\'d risk shutting down the government for cuts to Planned Parenthood, green energy programs, or the EPA? You maniac!<br />You can vote for Trump presidencies all you want, peons, but the GOP leadership has conceded that Democrats hold the ultimate budgetary trump card. It\'s an article of Republican faith that they will lose any and all budget battles, no matter the size of the GOP majority, because in the final hours Democrats will simply shrug and say, \""Give us what we want, or we\'ll shut the government down and you\'ll be blamed for it.\"" <br />The Democrats are so confident of their eternal whip hand in budget disputes that they openly threatened to shut the government down if their demands were not granted this time around, without bothering to conceal the threat at all. They know Republicans believe they will be held responsible for any such crisis. It doesn\'t matter how many red-ink-stained Democrat fingers are on the shutdown. It wouldn\'t matter if Democrat senators and representatives were caught on video running around Washington and pulling the plugs out of government computers. Terrified Republican leaders are convinced the media will never, ever frame the crisis as \""Democrats Shut Down Federal Government to Protect Illegal Alien Criminals.\""[2]<br />The GOP Establishment just emerged from a presidential primary in which Donald Trump bulldozed a huge field of top-shelf Republican contenders, in no small part because the public was furious with Republican inability to make progress on a conservative agenda despite holding both House and Senate. They seem to have learned nothing from the experience. <br />The GOP promised that if voters gave them the Senate in 2014 - an outcome deemed extremely unlikely going into the election cycle - they would march over former Majority Leader Harry Reid\'s political grave and get things done at last. <br />That didn\'t happen. We were told the power of President Obama\'s veto pen was unbeatable. But Obama didn\'t even have to use that pen, because the revolutionary new GOP Congress immediately set about giving the Democrat minority near-total control over the budget. The first item on the Republican leadership agenda in 2015 was sidelining every young Republican representative who took all that balanced-budget limited-government stuff seriously. By the end of the year, Democrats were crowing that House Speaker Paul Ryan and his allies \""gave away the store.\""[3][4]<br />It\'s funny how having a Republican president doesn\'t slow down Democrat budget priorities a bit, isn\'t it? In 2009, Republicans said they were helpless without congressional majorities. In 2010 they won the House, but said they were helpless without the Senate. Then they took the Senate, but said they were helpless without the White House. Democrats today are basically where Republicans were in 2009... but they\'re not helpless at all. They\'re still writing the budget and treating the GOP leadership like Harry Potter\'s house elves. Paul Ryan can only hope that one day Nancy Pelosi will mistakenly give him a sock and set him free.[5]<br />The winter of Republican triumph in 2014 gave us the horror of the \""cromnibus\"" bill - a complete surrender to the losers of the midterm election. Democrats effectively wrote the first budget after the big GOP midterm triumph. After listing all of the Republican capitulations, including legislative tricks that made it easier for President Obama to shoot down every Republican idea he didn\'t like, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) wrote in December 2015 that the only bright spot he could see were \""significant\"" steps toward \""repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood.\"" How significant do those steps look in retrospect?[6][7]<br />Angry and disappointed Republican voters sent an unmistakable message by turning to Trump in the GOP primary, even though every Establishment official and well-connected pundit assured them nominating Trump was tantamount to throwing the 2016 election away. The stunning upset of the 2014 midterm was surpassed by the even more stunning election of President Donald Trump in 2016. One hundred days in, the leaders of both party establishments and 90 percent of the punditocracy are still walking around like they use tasers on their temples in the shower every morning.<br />And the result of all those shocking upsets is... this? A budget bill Barack Obama would cheerfully have signed, assuming he didn\'t think he could squeeze a few billion more out of Republicans at the eleventh hour? Voters keep giving the GOP astounding election victories, and they keep responding with the same budget, over and over again.<br />Nearly everything Trump proposed cutting is funded in full - in many cases with substantial increases? $1.5 billion for border security, but not a nickel for the border wall - the single most concrete, unambiguous promise Trump made, both before and after the election? We were given endless excuses why the congressional \""power of the purse\"" could not be used to thwart Obama\'s agenda, but apparently, the Democrat minority can use it to thwart Trump\'s with ease.[8][9]<br />The big achievement touted by the White House and congressional leaders is increased military spending. \""We have boosted resources for our defense needs without corresponding increases in non-defense spending,\"" Speaker Ryan proclaimed.[10]<br />Those defense spending increases might be vitally needed, but what Ryan is saying here violates everything he previously stated about the need for fiscal discipline. The only enduring accomplishment of the Budget Control Act of 2011 was modestly restricting federal spending by menacing Republicans with military cuts and Democrats with domestic spending cuts - an Obama idea that was supposed to terrorize Republicans out of insisting on fiscal discipline at all. [11]<br />Here we are in 2017, and the big \""achievement\"" is that Democrats agreed to let Republicans spend more on the military, while Republicans gave Democrats everything they wanted on domestic spending. Republicans ended up right where Obama wanted them to be all along.<br />The message sent by this budget betrayal is that elections don\'t really matter all that much. The special interests that demand lavish funding from taxpayers will not be denied. Most of the matters we have heated political arguments over are actually beyond debate - the left will be funded no matter how you vote. What\'s the point of entering the arena of ideas, to do the hard work of arguing against the abortion lobby, when Planned Parenthood gets its bulging sack of taxpayer cash from a Republican House, Senate, and White House?<br />Do Republicans have the faintest clue how hollow and insincere their rhetoric sounds when the budgets and resolutions dribble out, and everything they claimed to oppose with passionate fury is fully funded? They\'re already reeling from the embarrassing \""Obamacare Lite\"" debacle, after years of vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act at every fundraiser - years of passing repeal bills they knew were doomed, folding them into paper airplanes, and tossing them at the window of Obama\'s Oval Office. How often do they think they can get away with fighting for nothing before disgusted voters throw up their hands and walk away forever?<br />References^ funded every left-wing priority (www.conservativereview.com)^ shut the government down (www.zerohedge.com)^ sidelining (www.americanthinker.com)^ crowing (www.breitbart.com)^ give him a sock (www.youtube.com)^ \""cromnibus\"" bill (humanevents.com)^ wrote in December 2015 (www.politico.com)^ funded in full (www.frontpagemag.com)^ not a nickel (www.bloomberg.com)^ touted (twitter.com)^ Budget Control Act of 2011 (budget.house.gov)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHhh8zQYasvdYpp2u4XVOWJay6UyQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779480102221&ei=4tMKWdD8L9XhWq_xh7AJ&url=http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/05/01/hayward-who-need-the-resistance-when-youve-got-the-gop-writing-the-budget/,EN,,04/05/2017 07:09,2017-05-01 19:15:51+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,Breitbart News,,,,,1493673351,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ff6f76c1fe,13 times that comics characters met their makers - A.V. Club,"13 times that comics characters met their makers · Inventory · The A.V. Club<br />Comic books have a long history of real-life creators being thrown into fictional narratives, often in smaller cameo appearances, but also in grander ways that have a deeper impact on the narrative. This inventory looks at examples where comic-book characters interact with their creators, which has two different interpretations: The first is when these characters meet the people that originally created them; moments that are occasionally crafted by the original creators, but can also be imagined by writers and artists that wish to pay tribute to the people that spawned these ideas. The second is when the writers and/or artists of specific issues insert themselves into the action, a technique that can be used to add meta comedy and commentary to a story. These character/creator meetings have a variety of narrative applications, and this list shows off a range of approaches for putting creators on the comics page.1. Stan Lee in Stan Lee Meets Superheroes (Olivier Coipel)In the Marvel movies, Stan Lee has made his love of cameos into such a big deal that he\'ll (jokingly) pin a movie\'s faults on whether he was asked to make an appearance[1]. But in the comics, he actually got an entire limited series based on him popping up in a superhero\'s world for no reason. Appropriately titled Stan Lee Meets Superheroes, the Lee-written books featured him appearing alongside Spider-Man, The Thing, Doctor Doom, Doctor Strange, and the Silver Surfer for offbeat, self-referential adventures. In a weird twist, Lee often plays himself-the iconic comic book writer who helped shape the Marvel Universe-but none of the heroes seem to think that\'s unusual. In fact, most of them don\'t even like him all that much, but it all plays nicely into the same goofy shtick that allows Lee to play Hugh Hefner in Iron Man or a space creep in Guardians Of The Galaxy. Really, only a self-promotion master like Stan Lee could come out looking cool even after several pages of Spider-Man making fun of him behind his back. [Sam Barsanti]2. Fantastic Four: Unstable Molecules #4 Fantastic Four has a long history of writers and artists putting themselves in the series, but one of the most effective instances takes a very different approach to the creator guest appearance. The concept of James Sturm and Guy Davis\' Eisner Award-winning miniseries, Fantastic Four: Unstable Molecules, is that it tells the \""true story\"" of the \""real\"" family that inspired Stan Lee and Jack Kirby to create the Fantastic Four. Sturm and Davis craft a grounded, emotional late-\'50s period piece rich with symbolism and complex personal dynamics, and all the drama of the first three issues builds to a climactic house party where tensions explode and the Sturm family is rocked to its core. Some of the guests at that party include Fantastic Four creators Jack Kirby and Stan Lee (along with long-time Marvel letterer Art Simek), who discover the seeds for their future idea by witnessing the volatile interactions of their hosts. These appearances are instrumental in selling the book\'s concept, but they also introduce moments of levity as the comic creators comment on the state of the industry, bringing much-needed humor to a dire situation that ultimately births Marvel\'s First Family. [Oliver Sava]3. The Incredible Hulk #418 Peter David had been writing The Incredible Hulk for seven years when he wrote himself into the wedding of Rick Jones and Marlo Chandler, serving as the officiating priest for a ceremony that quickly gets sucked into superhero craziness. A new superhuman, alien, or mystical presence interrupts David each of the three times he tries to begin the service; most come as late guests (Drax The Destroyer, The Frighful Four, Kree and Skrull representatives), but Mephisto arrives to demand Hulk\'s soul in exchange for that of the bride, who made a deal with the devil in an earlier dream. This light-hearted issue highlights the comedy that David brought to his 12-year run on the series, and artist Gary Frank does great work capturing David\'s likeness on the page. David is increasingly exhausted by the parade of colorful characters he has to deal with in this issue, but at least he only has to put up with them for one day instead of 12 years. [Oliver Sava]4. Animal Man Vol 1 #26 Grant Morrison may not have created Buddy Baker, but for many fans he is the writer that solidified him and made him worthy of attention. In Animal Man #26, the final issue to his late-\'80s run on the book, a Sandman-looking[2] Morrison meets his character face-to-face and deconstructs Baker\'s life. Morrison is talented, intellectual, and prone to meta-commentary, which makes this an ideal issue for him. Each panel is beautifully constructed by Chaz Truog, Mark Farmer, Tatjana Wood, and John Costanza; dozens of them could be used for fodder in any think piece on the comics industry, even 25 years later. Morrison comments on the cheapness of using death for drama, the interchangeability of \""generic blond superheroes with good teeth,\"" the tension of using personal loss to fuel narratives, and even thanks his co-creators and readers by name. The panels are dialogue-heavy-not uncommon for Morrison or the time-but the words pull no punches for Buddy or his writer. The commentary isn\'t cruel, but it is pointed, and Morrison questions his own intensions in giving Buddy an unambiguously happy ending. He ends Animal Man on a request for joy and integrity, a plea to return to something lighter and kinder, which is a message a lot of current creators could take note of. [Caitlin Rosberg] 5. Howard The Duck Vol 1 #16 Comics that heavily feature creators as themselves are in many ways the perfect snapshot not only of the individual, but also of the time in which they were creating. Howard The Duck #16 (Marvel) is no exception. Steve Gerber, in the throes of taking on far too many jobs, wrote an entire issue of self-referential prose and huge double-page spreads that are at once very Gerber-esque and also very late-\'70s in attitude and execution. Overwhelmed by his deadlines, he created a book that features 20 pencil artists and inkers, with colors by Doc Martin and letters by Irv Watanabe the only unifying factor from page to page. The result oscillates between introspection and industry observation, from self-pitying to bitter and back again. The issue shows Gerber, creative and innovative storyteller, boggled and perhaps a little hurt by how the popularity of his odd little duck has surpassed his expectations and perhaps outgrown him; he talks about and to Howard like a spouse braced for divorce. When he wrote that he relates to Howard because the duck \""won\'t become an institution,\"" it\'s probably with the assumption that his success can\'t last much longer. With Howard\'s big-screen debut a decade away, his newfound popularity under a writer nearly as surrealist as Gerber himself 40 years off, Gerber had no way of knowing just how wrong he was. [Caitlin Rosberg]6. Hellblazer #120 When John Constantine\'s first book observed its 10th anniversary, a whole bunch of folks came to celebrate-including most of the creators who had worked on the character to that date. Depending on your familiarity with British comic-book creators of the 1980s and 1990s, you might recognize any number of faces at the party, including the likes of Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis, and the comic\'s own writer, Paul Jenkins. Special respect is accorded, however, to the older gent who sits in the corner. You can\'t see his face very well, but you can\'t miss the silhouette of unkempt hair and beard that unmistakably mark the magus of Northampton. As John says, \""Old mate of mine, from before I was even a player... We\'ve dropped out of touch a bit since then. I mean, we run into each other from time to time, but nothing much of consequence.\"" Even though he created the guy, Alan Moore never wrote a single issue of Hellblazer, having been mostly already out the door at DC before Constantine scored his own series in 1987. John still remembered to raise a pint in salute to the man without whom he would still be just another anonymous Sting lookalike wandering the back alleys of Thatcher\'s England. [Tim O\'Neil]7. The Flash #179 If you know your DC Comics lore, you know that Earth-One was the home of the Silver Age superheroes, a period that began with the introduction of the Barry Allen Flash in 1956. Earth-Two was the parallel world where the heroes who had been published in the earlier Golden Age lived-essentially, everyone from the first appearance of Superman up through the mid-1950s. There were more, in fact, a supposedly infinite number, which were subsequently demolished during 1985\'s Crisis On Infinite Earths miniseries. We\'re part of it, too-yes, you and I, dear reader-because we live on Earth-Prime. This issue marks the first appearance of Earth-Prime, as Barry Allen finds himself unexpectedly zapped off Earth-One by a mysterious monster named Nok. He finds himself trapped on a world where Barry Allen is a character in a children\'s comic book, and where the only man who can help him find his way home is the editor of that very comic, Julius Schwartz. Schwartz helps the marooned Allen rebuild his cosmic treadmill in order to return to Earth-One, where Allen cobbles together a scientific solution to the menace of the Nok. Although Schwartz was The Flash\'s editor for almost 25 years and maintained a close connection with the character throughout his history, his inclusion in the story would later assume a more regrettable air, for reasons that will soon become obvious. [Tim O\'Neil]8. Justice League Of America #123 A few years later, writers Cary Bates and Elliot S. Maggin found Allen\'s jury-rigged cosmic treadmill in the back of Schwartz\'s office. After materializing on Earth-Two Bates suddenly turns evil and sets about trying to conquer the world, because comics. Maggin follows, only to end up on Earth-One, where he alerts the Justice League to the menace of unwanted intruders from Earth-Prime. This was one of the annual JLA/JSA crossovers that appeared in the pages of Justice League Of America every year between 1963 and 1984, and as such it\'s a bit of a jumble, as many of these crossovers are. Bates becomes evil because he is secretly under the control of Earth-Two supervillain The Wizard, but he\'s still smart enough to use his newfound powers to manipulate the Justice League into murdering their Earth-Two counterparts in the Justice Society. Only the timely intervention of the Spectre, praying to God to restore the JSA to life, saves the day, as the Heavenly Presence complies and resurrects the dead heroes. Bates is cleared of all wrongdoing after The Wizard\'s spell has been countered, and he and Maggin are promptly returned to Earth-Prime, where they find Julius Schwartz sitting in his office eating bean soup-which was surely hilarious for the dozens of people who worked at DC in 1975. Maybe you had to be there. [Tim O\'Neil]9. Superman #411 The saga of Earth-Prime came to an end in 1985. With Crisis breathing down the necks of everyone at DC, they took one last opportunity to say goodbye with \""The Last Earth-Prime Story.\"" The issue also served double-duty as a surprise 70th-anniversary birthday present for Schwartz, who stars in the story. His Earth-One counterpart has seen better days, reduced to living on the street and jumping off buildings in order to get Superman\'s attention. After a few twists the story ends with Superman taking the dying Earth-One Schwartz to meet his successful Earth-Prime counterpart, just then celebrating his birthday surrounded by generations of DC staffers. Although Earth-Prime may have been a gimmick setting designed to give creators the opportunities to tell some friendly in-jokes about the office, in hindsight its status as a vanity setting for Julius Schwartz stories seems questionable, given the multiple and sustained allegations of sexual harassment over his long career that have surfaced in recent decades. Superman couldn\'t have known, obviously, as he is just a comic-book character, but the heartfelt plaudits are hard to read nonetheless. [Tim O\'Neil] 10. Spawn #10This is a weird one. To conclude the first blockbuster year of Spawn, as well as to counter criticisms that the early Image books were poorly written, creator Todd McFarlane commissioned stories by four of the industry\'s biggest names: Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Frank Miller, and Dave Sim. While Gaiman\'s contribution would eventually return to bite McFarlane on the ass, it was Sim\'s issue that most baffled readers and critics on initial release. The \""story,\"" such as it is, features Spawn brought face-to-face with the metaphorical imprisonment of every great superhero character in existence. They are not free because their creators have sold them. Despite his great power Spawn is unable to free these heroes, and soon encounters Sim\'s own creation Cerebus. Only, it\'s not \""Spawn\"" who meets \""Cerebus,\"" but Sim who meets McFarlane, through the medium of their most famous creations. They walk around Sim\'s neighborhood of Kitchener, Ontario for a while before ending up at McFarlane\'s palatial estate-quite literally the house Spider-Man built-where McFarlane meets his own wife and infant daughter. \""Your creator is still with you,\"" Cerebus/Sim tells Spawn/McFarlane, \""He didn\'t sell you. It\'s as simple as that.\"" As strange as it may seem, the story\'s message couldn\'t be clearer: Spawn and Cerebus are the trademark and copyright of their respective creators, forever. [Tim O\'Neil]11. Cerebus The Aardvark \""Minds\"" arc Each \""act\"" of Dave Sim\'s sprawling, 300-issue epic Cerebus ends with the titular Earth-pig undergoing a religious ascension, rocketing into space to be confronted with the harsh truths of his funny-animal-meets-Conan The Barbarian life. For the last of these-the Minds arc-his interlocutor comes in the form of a voice in his head, identifying itself simply as \""Dave.\"" Presented with a chance to talk to his creation one-on-one, Sims lays out every self-destructive mistake Cerebus has ever made, lambasting him for his endless hungers, his thoughtless idealism of the women in his life, and his inability to be happy even when he\'s got everything he wants. During their conversation, \""Dave\"" claims he has no control over what Cerebus chooses to do, that his role is only to present his characters with situations and see how they react. But given that Sims spent the next hundred issues of Cerebus descending into a sort of lavishly drawn, misogynistic fugue state-spurred on by the wide-scale collapse of his personal life and a supposed religious revelation of his own-it\'s hard not to read Minds as the author\'s last gasp of sanity and self-critique. [William Hughes]12. Opus Satoshi Kon has made a career of blurring the borders between reality and fiction, but Opus is the only one that dives directly into Kon\'s own wheelhouse: comics. The unfinished comic tells the story of Chikara Nagai, a cartoonist who is sucked into the pages of his own manga by a character who doesn\'t want to die. Nagai interacts directly with his characters, the structure and quality of his own work, and the emotional origins of his material. It\'s metafiction at its most controlled. Thematically, Kon compares storytellers to gods, commenting on the frustrations of fate, destiny, and the inability to self-determine. In addition, it\'s perhaps a lesson for other creators: Your characters should be people; treat them with care and think of them as such. However, the greatest magic of Opus is in its ending. Though the comic is technically \""unfinished,\"" an ending to the comic-pencils only, itself unfinished-was found among Kon\'s things after his death in 2010. With the agreement of his family, the comic was republished with this new ending and a note describing these events. Let\'s just say there\'s a reason this comic solidly qualifies to appear on this list. [J.A. Micheline]13. Fantastic Four Of all the long-running comics series, none have had quite as much fun inserting its creators into the action as the Fantastic Four. The tradition began all the way back in Fantastic Four #10, when Dr. Doom burst into the Marvel offices to confront Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (as part of a complex plot to switch bodies with Reed Richards), even removing his iconic mask in order to show them his grotesquely disfigured face. Lee and Kirby showed up again at the wedding of Reed Richards and Susan Storm, being shown the door just as the celebration commenced in Fantastic Four Annual #3. Later creators got in on the fun, too: Comedy menace the Impossible Man ran roughshod over the mid-\'70s Marvel bullpen in an attempt to talk Lee into giving him his own book in Fantastic Four #176. Writer-artist John Byrne later drew himself into the conclusion of the long-running \""Trial Of Galactus\"" storyline in Fantastic Four #262, an event which also coincided with the notorious \""Assistant Editors\' Month\"" event, which saw similarly goofy stunts across the Marvel line. It wasn\'t all fun and games, either. Steve Englehart\'s run on Marvel\'s first family was truncated by editorial interference so severe that eventually Englehart felt obligated to remove his name from the last issues of his run, which were instead credited to \""John Harkness.\"" Harkness appears, alongside his family, in the last issue of Englehart\'s run (#333), to explain to the FF just why their last string of comic book adventures appeared so out-of-character. The tradition continues to the present, with Matt Fraction and Mike Allred appearing alongside the FF during their recent run. Whenever the FF return from their current limbo, it\'s a fair bet that the book will continue to find the strangest ways to fit in cameos from the men and women who produce it. At this point, it\'s expected.

ff8816498e,A scientist weighs up the five main anti-abortion arguments - The Guardian (blog),"A scientist weighs up the five main anti-abortion arguments | Science<br />There are few topics in modern discourse quite as divisive, as fraught with misunderstanding and as rooted in deeply-held conviction as abortion.<br />Those on the pro-choice side of the spectrum argue that it is a woman\'s right to choose whether she carries a pregnancy to term or not. On the other side, anti-abortion activists insist that from the moment of conception a foetus has an inalienable right to existence. In recent years, polarisation has increased[1] and the topic has become exceptionally politically partisan, with the personal and political aspects increasingly difficult to separate.<br />Amid all the passionate argument, it is easy for misunderstandings and fictions to fill the void between opposing ideologies. Yet if we are to have a reasoned discussion about abortion rights, we have to jettison the persistent falsehoods that cloud the topic. If we are to choose reason over rhetoric, it is worth addressing some of the more pernicious myths that emerge each time the abortion question is raised.<br />Abortion leads to depression and suicide<br />Of all the myths surrounding abortion, I feel that the assertion that it leads to depression and suicide must rank as the most odious. It is a perennial favourite of anti-abortion groups. Anti-abortion campaigners call it PAS - post-abortion-syndrome, a term coined by Dr Vincent Rue. Rue is a prolific anti-abortion campaigner who testified before the US Congress in 1981 that he had observed post-traumatic stress syndrome in women who had undergone abortions. The claim rapidly mutated into the ominous and potent suggestion that abortion leads to suicide and depression. Yet despite the ubiquity of this claim by anti-abortion advocates, PAS is not recognised by relevant expert bodies. It does not appear in the DSM-V (the handbook of mental health), and the link between abortion and mental health problems is dismissed by organisations tasked with mental health protection including the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. [2][3][4][5]<br />The reason for this dismissive attitude is simple: despite years of research there is no evidence that PAS exists. The hypothesis that women who undergo an abortion have worse mental health outcomes than those that don\'t is at heart a scientific claim and can be tested as such. One recent study in Denmark [6]charted the psychological health of 365,550 women, including 84,620 who\'d had abortions. They found neither an increase in psychological damage, nor any elevated risk of suicide. This finding isn\'t especially surprising, as previous investigations[7] found that provided a woman was not already depressive then \""elective abortion of an unintended pregnancy does not pose a risk to mental health\"". In an article for the Journal of the American Medical Association entitled \""The myth of the abortion trauma syndrome\""[8] , Dr. Nada Stotland eloquently stated[9] the disconnect between the message of anti-choice organisations and the peer-reviewed literature on the subject: \""Currently, there are active attempts to convince the public and women considering abortion that abortion frequently has negative psychiatric consequences. This assertion is not borne out by the literature: the vast majority of women tolerate abortion without psychiatric sequelae\"", a conclusion echoed in systematic reviews[10].<br />But despite the science simply not supporting the assertions of the anti-abortion brigade, the myth persists. In a relatively recent move, some US states now require physicians to warn women seeking an abortion of the dangers to their mental health, in spite of the complete lack of scientific justification for doing so. In South Dakota, a 2005 state law[11] not only mandated this perversion of informed consent, but also added a reprehensible smattering of emotional manipulation by insisting women be told they are terminating \""a whole, separate, unique, living human being\"". The jarring disconnect between scientific best evidence and the practices enforced by legislation is worrying, expressed with weary regret by the Guttmacher institute[12]: \"" ... anti-abortion activists are able to take advantage of the fact that the general public and most policy-makers do not know what constitutes \""good science ... to defend their positions, these activists often cite studies that have serious methodological flaws or draw inappropriate conclusions from more rigorous studies\"". <br />Contrary to the assertions of anti-abortion activists, the majority of women granted an abortion report relief as their primary feeling, not depression. The research also unveils a subtle but important corollary; whilst women are don\'t generally suffer long-term mental health effects related to the abortion, short term guilt and sadness was far more likely if the women came from a background where abortion was viewed negatively or their decisions decried. Given this is precisely the attitude fostered by anti-abortion activists, there is a dark irony at play when organisations of this ilk increase the suffering of the very women they claim to help.[13]<br />Abortion causes cancer<br />As if abortion were not already an emotive enough issue, elements of the anti-abortion movement have long postulated that women who elect to have an abortion are at a much increased risk of cancer, particularly of the breast. This is absolute unbridled nonsense of the highest order - the abortion-breast-cancer conjecture (ABC) was championed by prominent born-again Christian and anti-abortion campaigner Dr Joel Brind in the early 1990s. This alleged link is not supported by the scientific literature, and the ostensible link between breast cancer and induced abortion is explicitly rejected by the medical community.[14][15]<br />But whilst there is scant scientific evidence for the ABC hypothesis, this didn\'t stop the administration of George W. Bush altering the National Cancer Institute (NCI) website[16] to suggest that elective abortion may lead to breast cancer in the early 2000s. The medical community reacted with disgust, and the New York Times slammed the rhetorical duplicity of the Bush administration as an \""egregious distortion\""[17]. The NCI convened a workshop to look at the evidence in February 2003, and concluded[18] that the hypothesis was devoid of any supporting evidence and was political rather than medical in nature. After this stinging rebuke, Brind resorted to hackneyed conspiracy theory, claiming that it was a \""corrupt federal agency\""[19] and dedicated to \""protecting the abortion industry\""[20], as well as directing his ire towards the mainstream medical community[21].<br />Claims that abortion increases the risk of cancer are not credible, a position supported by bodies worldwide, including the WHO, the National Cancer Institute, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Yet the ABC myth is still a potent weapon in the arsenal of anti-abortion campaigners. In 2005, Canadian anti-abortion protesters put up posters alleging a cover-up by national cancer bodies. Even today, some US state legislation demands physicians warn women about the risk despite the complete absence of a reason to suspect there is one. As an article in Medical History explains, this continuing focus on the non-existence of a link is the culmination of the \""... anti-abortion movement\'s efforts, following the violence of the early 1990s, to regain respectability through changing its tactics and rhetoric, which included the adoption of the ABC link as part of its new \'women-centred\' strategy.\""[22][23][24][25]<br />Abortion reduces fertility<br />The suggestion that abortion can damage fertility is understandably terrifying, but based on out-dated understanding of abortion techniques. Early surgical abortions tended to be performed using a dilation and curettage (D&C) method, with an inherent but small risk of scarring that could potentially lead to complication. However, this technique is obsolete[26], replaced with a much safer and effective suction method in the early 1970s. In the 21st century, the WHO recommend a suction-based technique[27] for surgical abortion, rendering the risk to future fertility negligible.<br />On top of this, across most of Europe the majority of abortions now take place early in the pregnancy[28], below 9 weeks. Abortions at this early stage are medical in nature, using compounds such as mifepristone (RU-486) which induce miscarriage. There is no evidence[29] that either medical or modern surgical abortion impacts future fertility.<br />The foetus can feel pain<br />One of the most inflammatory arguments against abortion is rooted in the assertion that the foetus can feel pain, and that termination is therefore a brutal affair. This is extremely unlikely to be true[30]. A foetus in the early stages of development lacks the developed nervous system and brain to feel pain or even be aware of their surroundings. The neuroanatomical apparatus required for pain and sensation is not complete until about 26 weeks[31] into pregnancy. As the upper limit worldwide for termination is 24 weeks, and the vast majority of pregnancies are terminated well before this (most in the first 9 weeks in the UK), the question of foetal pain is a complete red herring. This is reflected in the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\'s report on foetal pain[32], which concludes \""... existing data suggests that cortical processing and therefore foetal perception of pain cannot occur before 24 weeks of gestation\"".<br />Despite its complete lack of veracity, this myth remains a powerful one, and in several US states legislation dictates that doctors can be fined for not warning women that the foetus might experience pain, despite the scientific advice suggesting \""proposals to inform women seeking abortions of the potential for pain in foetuses are not supported by evidence. Legal or clinical mandates for interventions to prevent such pain are scientifically unsound and may expose women to inappropriate interventions, risks, and distress.\""[33][34]<br />Reducing access to abortion decreases demand for abortion<br />Anti-abortion campaigners often operate under the implicit assumption that additional hurdles towards obtaining abortions will decrease the number of abortion performed; this is demonstrably false. Reducing access to abortion doesn\'t quell the demand for abortion, and making abortion illegal simply makes abortion less safe. Evidence suggests that the abortion rate is approximately equal in countries with and without legal abortion. A 2012 Lancet study[35] found that regions with restricted abortion access have higher rates than more liberal areas, and restricted regions had a much higher incidence of unsafe abortion. Worldwide, about 42 million women a year choose to get abortions, and of these about 21.6 million are unsafe. The consequences of this are grim, resulting in around 47,000 maternal deaths a year[36]. This makes it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality[37] (13%), and can lead to serious complications even when survived.<br />In the developed world where international travel is affordable, abortion restrictions make even less sense. Ireland, for example, has incredibly restrictive abortion laws, a hangover from the days when it was the last outpost of the Vatican in Europe (a situation I\'ve alluded to before[38]). But whilst the Irish anti-abortion lobbyists boast of Ireland being abortion-free, this sanctimonious gloat ignores that fact that an average of 12 women a day[39] travel to Britain for abortions, with others procuring abortificants online. These extra barriers do not dissuade women from seeking terminations, they merely add emotional and financial obstacles to obtaining them.<br />These are just some of the claims which surface, hydra-like, when abortion is discussed, and this article is by no means comprehensive. Abortion[40] is an emotive issue, and there is an an entire spectrum of positions which one might subscribe to. And of course, people have every right to hold any opinion they like. But we do not have the right to invent our own facts, and perpetuating debunked fiction helps no one. Such cynical truth-bending is not only intellectually vapid, it compounds an already difficult situation many women face, substituing emotive and sometimes manipulative fabrications in lieu of clear information.<br />Dr David Robert Grimes is a physicist and cancer researcher at Oxford University.

a54298df43,Horn fly bites suck profits from your beef herd - Beef Magazine,"Horn fly bites suck profits from your beef herd<br />\""High horn fly populations can cause blood loss and increased cattle stress or annoyance,\"" says Ted Perry, cattle nutritionist with Purina Animal Nutrition. \""Annoyance can cause cattle to use their energy to combat flies, change their grazing patterns and cause cattle grouping. Ultimately, it can lead to decreases in milk production, causing a reduction in calf weaning weights.\""<br />That\'s because horn flies can punish your cattle with as many as 120,000 bites per day. During peak timeframes, as many as 4,000 horn flies can call a cow\'s hide home. At 30 blood meals per day, that adds up to 120,000 bites per cow. Not only are these bites irritating your cows, but with production losses for the U.S. cattle industry are estimated at up to $1 billion annually, they\'re also biting away at your profits.<br />From ear tags and pour-ons to mineral or feed supplements with fly control, there are a lot of different ways to manage flies. And each solution has a place in the industry, adds Perry.<br />With so many fly control options available, what\'s the best way to break the horn fly cycle?<br />\""The best place to start is by breaking the life cycle in the manure,\"" says Perry.<br />Making manure magic <br />One of the most convenient and consistent ways to control horn flies in cattle is giving them a mineral supplement that contains an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR).<br />\""An IGR passes through the animal and into the manure, where horn flies lay their eggs,\"" says Perry. \""It breaks the horn fly life cycle by preventing pupae from developing into biting adult flies.\""<br />Watch a video[1] (http://bit.ly/1oSaou2[2]) demonstration to see how a mineral supplement containing IGR works to control flies.<br />Using mineral supplements with an IGR can help reduce expenses, labor and stress on your cattle that other methods can cause. Cattle don\'t need to be rounded up or handled, since IGR is consumed by the animal and fly control is spread through its manure as it grazes.<br />It also provides consistency, as cattle are regularly consuming IGR through their mineral.<br />In like a lion, out like a lamb<br />Weather forecasts predict a particularly wet spring and hot summer, a great combination for horn fly populations. Perry says you should act now to keep fly populations under control this summer and into fall.<br />\""Feed a fly control mineral 30 days before the last frost of spring, before fly emergence,\"" says Perry. \""This 30-day window at the beginning of spring is critical, because temperatures can fluctuate to levels that cause flies to emerge. Once those flies are present, you want to have fly control in the manure.\""<br />Perry recommends continuing to feed fly control mineral through summer and 30 days after the last frost in the fall.<br />\""You might have an aggressive spring and summer fly control strategy, but finishing strong in fall is also really important,\"" he adds. \""Horn flies overwinter in the pupal stage, which can jump-start adult populations in the spring. Using fly control mineral longer in the fall decreases the opportunity for flies to overwinter in the soil and reduces large fly populations the following spring.\""<br />Don\'t let it wash away<br />There are many forms of fly control mineral available, but it\'s important to choose one that can stand up to the unpredictable weather that spring brings. Rain and other elements can quite literally wash your mineral investment down the drain, or turn your mineral into a brick-type substance which cattle often refuse to eat.<br />Look for a fly control mineral that can withstand the weather. A weatherized mineral should have a large particle size and adequate water and wind resistance.<br />\""Using a fly control mineral this spring can help keep fly populations down, but only if cattle are consuming it. If you\'re not seeing consumption because the mineral has been turned into a hard block or because the particles are being blown away, then your investment is a loss,\"" adds Perry.<br />For more information on planning your spring fly control program, contact Ted Perry at (816) 243-6231 or TCPerry@landolakes.com[3], or go to: www.purinamills.com/cattle[4].<br />Material on BEEF Briefing Room comes directly from company news releases.

Some sheep die from the stress of the chase, and ewes may miscarry.\""It\'s also distressing for the farmer to find sheep injured or dead.\""The trust acknowledged that there are many responsible dog owners and said the trust wanted to raise awareness of the issue among the dog walking community.It is a criminal offence to allow a dog to worry sheep, and offenders can face a fine up to £1,000.Worrying includes attacking or chasing sheep and in some circumstances farmers are legally entitled to shoot dogs if they are endangering their sheep.READ MORE:<br />References^ Comments (0) (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFG-GftA2HB7y6Pt64iIuI5oeTm2Q&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=5dF5WOihIYvcWsL4quAM&url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/keep-dogs-on-leads-near-livestock-plea-after-rise-in-south-devon-sheep-deaths/story-30056200-detail/story.html,EN,,14/01/2017 08:07,2017-01-13 15:12:47+00:00,7903d30a98,Torquay Herald Express,,,,,1484323967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2e81fcd742,The CPC\'s bringing back the abortion debate ? bet on it - iPolitics.ca (subscription),"The CPC\'s bringing back the abortion debate - bet on it<br />Justin Trudeau must have slept like a baby last night. 2019 is no longer the year of living dangerously as far as the Conservative threat to his regency is concerned.<br />Not only did the social conservatives retain control of the Harper Party, but in Andrew Scheer, the former PM (still thought to be a behind-the-scenes puppet-master by some) likely got the candidate he wanted. At the very least, he did not get an uppity progressive like Michael Chong - who defied him in the days of Harper\'s flat-out authoritarianism - or the weak tea of an Erin O\'Toole.<br />No, the only way Saturday\'s result could have been less dangerous for the Liberals is if \""Mad Max\"" Bernier had been elected instead. The fumbles made by the Beauce Beau Brummell were just too, too obvious.<br />For many years, Harper took very good care of Scheer. By putting him in the Speaker\'s chair at a very young age (a six ballot victory back in 2011), he gave Scheer high public visibility with low political risk. The Speaker never takes part in divisive policy debates, and the daily platform allowed him time to polish his French to leadership-quality levels.<br />The new Conservative leader was careful to tip his hat to Harper in his acceptance speech. Decorum, yes. But not all decorum.<br />Given that O\'Toole\'s moderate supporters played a key role in getting Scheer the top job, it would be easy to overstate the obvious influence of social conservatives on the outcome. But there is no denying that they had a real impact on the final result. And they were quick to send Scheer the bill for the help provided by Brad Trost, Pierre Lemieux and thousands of their supporters. Here\'s what the anti-abortion group We Need a Law put out in the wake of Scheer\'s victory:<br />\""During the leadership campaign, Scheer stated, \'I believe 100 per cent that members of Parliament have the right to bring forward and debate any legislation of importance to them.\' We are encouraged by this promise of a friendlier and more welcoming environment in Parliament for individual members to introduce legislation protecting pre-born human rights.\""<br />The message was hardly subliminal: congratulations ... and a warning. Like a lot of other voices on the Religious Right, they were putting the new leader on notice that pro-life and pro-family values had better be recognized in policy by the new leader - or else. Half-measures won\'t work.<br />These social conservatives worked their hearts out for Stephen Harper for ten years. In return, they got nothing but strategic tokenism. The passion they invest in their cause never gave Harper so much as a palpitation - but it did lead him to calculate that he could bamboozle them \'til the cows came home and cash in on their political usefulness.<br />Scheer will be given no free passes. It\'s one thing for him to have vouchsafed his social conservative credentials by voting against gay marriage and transgender rights. But the acid test for Scheer will be the abortion debate.<br />This time, the so-cons were wised up. They sold thousands of memberships on behalf of Trost and Lemieux. That support ultimately went Scheer\'s way. Now they will expect him to deliver.<br />As We Need a Law plainly stated in their press release, their goal is nothing less than the \""regulation\"" of abortion in Canada, aimed at \""protecting fetal interests at some stage of pregnancy.\""<br />And that leads to a head-on collision somewhere down the road for the cheerful cherub who is now the Big Blue Boss.<br />On the one hand, Scheer has ramped up expectations that pro-life legislation can be introduced by MPs; on the other, the new leader is firmly on the record declaring that party policy pledges that a Conservative government will not introduce legislation to revive the abortion debate in Canada. Politicians may call that adroit communications. Normal people call it sucking and blowing.<br />It has not been forgotten by the hardcore social conservatives that Harper encouraged Conservative MPs to vote against a private member\'s bill put forth by Conservative MP Stephen Woodworth back in 2012 intended to start a debate about when human life actually begins. (Some would argue that, in Harper\'s case, that process never really began.) That bill, of course, was intended as a means of bringing the abortion debate through the back door. Harper saw the political danger and squashed the effort like a bug.<br />So Scheer will be given no free passes. It\'s one thing for him to have vouchsafed his social conservative credentials by voting against gay marriage and the Liberal transgender rights bill in 2016. But the acid test for Scheer will be the abortion debate for this part of his constituency. Will he advance it, as the Religious Right hopes and expects - or smother it, as Harper did?<br />If he advances it, the CPC will be unelectable in almost every major political market in Canada, from Toronto and its Metro suburbs to the province of Quebec. If he smothers it, the hardcore social conservative base will either abandon the party for more agreeable niche choices, like the Christian Heritage Party, or simply take up kissing snakes full time.<br />In either case, there is another major loser with the election of Bland Man to the top Tory post. (Yes, bland and reassuring, as Harper was himself in the early days - much like the flannel-throated American neo-con Paul Wolfowitz.) And that loser is Peter MacKay.<br />MacKay is a man who walked away from the gunfight for the soul of the CPC. He took the short walk to Bay Street to cash in his political chips, as did his former colleague John Baird (though Baird exhibited an international sense of opportunism and did it first).<br />Given the stunning fact that Brad Trost, who is uncomfortable \""with the whole gay thing\"", finished ahead of a candidate like Michael Chong, it\'s official: There is no party for MacKay to save now. He said during the convention that he wasn\'t ruling out a return to politics.

a57330d045,Farmers wary of Trump trade policies - AberdeenNews.com,"Farmers wary of Trump trade policies |<br />WASHINGTON - A sizable majority of rural Americans backed Donald Trump\'s presidential bid, drawn to his calls to slash environmental rules, strengthen law enforcement and replace the federal health care law.But many farmers are nervous about another plank in Trump\'s agenda: His vow to overhaul U.S. trade policy, including his intent announced Thursday to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.Trump\'s message that NAFTA was a job-killing disaster had never resonated much in rural America. NAFTA had widened access to Mexican and Canadian markets, boosting U.S. farm exports and benefiting many farmers.Farm Country went on red alert last month when it looked as if Trump wasn\'t even going to pursue a NAFTA rewrite: White House aides had spread the word that the president would simply withdraw from the pact.\""Mr. President, America\'s corn farmers helped elect you,\"" Wesley Spurlock of the National Corn Growers Association warned in a statement. \""Withdrawing from NAFTA would be disastrous for American agriculture.\""Within hours, Trump softened his stance. He wouldn\'t actually dump NAFTA, he said. He\'d first try to forge a more advantageous deal with Mexico and Canada - a move that formally began Thursday when his top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, informed Congress of the administration\'s intent to renegotiate NAFTA.Blame gameAs a candidate, Trump defined his \""America First\"" stance as a means to fight unfair foreign competition. He blamed unjust deals for swelling U.S. trade gaps and stealing factory jobs.But NAFTA and other deals have been good for American farmers, who stand to lose if Trump ditches the pact or ignites a trade war. The United States has enjoyed a trade surplus in farm products since at least 1967, government data show. Last year, farm exports exceeded imports by $20.5 billion.\""You don\'t start off trade negotiations ... by picking fights with your trade partners that are completely unnecessary,\"" said Aaron Lehman, a fifth-generation Iowa farmer who produces corn, soybeans, oats and hay.Many farmers worry that Trump\'s policies will jeopardize their exports just as they face weaker crop and livestock prices.\""It comes up pretty quickly in conversation,\"" said Blake Hurst, a corn and soybean farmer in northwestern Missouri\'s Atchison County.That county\'s voters backed Trump more than 3-to-1 in the election, but now feel \""it would be better if the rhetoric (on trade) was a little less strident,\"" said Hurst, president of the Missouri Farm Bureau.NAFTA\'s impactTrump\'s main argument against NAFTA and other pacts was that they exposed American workers to unequal competition with low-wage workers in countries like Mexico and China.NAFTA did lead some American manufacturers to move factories and jobs to Mexico. But since it took effect in 1994 and eased tariffs, annual farm exports to Mexico have jumped nearly five-fold to about $18 billion. Mexico is the No. 3 market for U.S. agriculture, notably corn, soybeans and pork.\""The trade agreements that we\'ve had have been very beneficial,\"" said Stephen Censky, CEO of the American Soybean Association. \""We need to take care not to blow the significant gains that agriculture has won.\""The U.S. has run a surplus in farm trade with Mexico for 20 of the 23 years since NAFTA took effect. Still, the surpluses with Mexico became deficits in 2015 and 2016 as global livestock and grain prices plummeted and shrank the value of American exports, notes Joseph Glauber of the International Food Policy Research Institute.Mexico has begun to seek alternatives to U.S. food because, as its agriculture secretary, Jose Calzada Rovirosa, said in March, Trump\'s remarks on trade \""have injected uncertainty\"" into the agriculture business.Once word had surfaced that Trump was considering pulling out of NAFTA, Sonny Perdue, two days into his job as the president\'s agriculture secretary, hastened to the White House with a map showing areas that would be hurt most by a pullout, overlapped with many that voted for Trump.\""I tried to demonstrate to him that in the agricultural market, sometimes words like \'withdraw\' or \'terminate\' can have a major impact on markets,\"" Perdue said in an interview with the AP. \""I think the president made a very wise decision for the benefit of many agricultural producers across the country\"" by choosing to remain in NAFTA.TPP abandonedTrump delivered another disappointment for U.S. farm groups in January by fulfilling a pledge to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the Obama administration negotiated with 11 Asia-Pacific countries. Trump argued that the pact would cost Americans jobs by pitting them against low-wage Asian labor.But the deal would have given U.S. farmers broader access to Japan\'s notoriously impregnable market and easier entry into fast-growing Vietnam. Philip Seng of the U.S. Meat Export Federation notes that the U.S. withdrawal from TPP left Australia with a competitive advantage because it had already negotiated lower tariffs in Japan.Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports, thereby raising fears that those trading partners would retaliate with their own sanctions.First casualtiesFarmers know they\'re frequently the first casualties of trade wars. Many recall a 2009 trade rift in which China responded to U.S. tire tariffs by imposing tariffs on U.S. chicken parts. And Mexico slapped tariffs on U.S. goods ranging from ham to onions to Christmas trees in 2009 to protest a ban on Mexican trucks crossing the border.The White House declined to comment on farmers\' fears that Trump\'s trade policy stands to hurt them. But officials say they\'ve sought to ease concerns, by, for example, having Agriculture Secretary Perdue announce a new undersecretary to oversee trade and foreign agricultural affairs.Many farmers are still hopeful about the Trump administration. Some, for example, applaud his plans to slash environmental rules that they say inflate the cost of running a farm. Some also hold out hope that the author of \""The Art of the Deal\"" will negotiate ways to improve NAFTA.Dairy, cattle farmersOne such way might involve Canada. NAFTA let Canada shield its dairy farmers from foreign competition behind tariffs and regulations, but left at least one exception - an American ultra-filtered milk used in cheese. When Canadian farmers complained about the cheaper imports, Canada changed its policy and effectively priced ultra-filtered American milk out of the market.\""Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult,\"" Trump tweeted last month. \""We will not stand for this. Watch!\""Some U.S. cattle producers would also like a renegotiated NAFTA to give them something the current version doesn\'t: The right to label their product \""Made in America.\"" In 2015, the World Trade Organization struck down the United States\' country-of-origin labeling rules as unfair to Mexico and Canada.Many still worry that Trump\'s planned overhaul of American trade policy is built to revive manufacturing and that farming remains an afterthought.\""So much of the conversation in the campaign had been in Detroit or in Indiana\"" and focused on manufacturing jobs, said Kathy Baylis, an economist at the University of Illinois. The importance of American farm exports \""never made it into the rhetoric.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEUFdAeh-OWUxjZapzhTdY2w-uaBA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779500685343&ei=gOAjWeynH4a1WuPip5gC&url=http://www.aberdeennews.com/farmers-wary-of-trump-trade-policies/article_01d3f807-09d7-5a34-a1dd-6830184b7496.html,EN,,23/05/2017 07:11,2017-05-22 10:30:58+00:00,d4f07714c5,AberdeenNews.com,,,,,1495456258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a5723fa3e5,Imphal city: Call for public awareness - The Sangai Express,"Imphal city: Call for public awareness<br />IntroductionIt is good news that Imphal city could secured a place in the second round of \""Fast tract smart city\"" competition which have selected 13 more smart cities which was conducted by the ministry of Urban Development and Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Government of India (The Sangai Express, May 26, 2016 issue). While planning about a smart city we need to give emphasis on bio-pollutants available in our environment. The Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorous L.), a native of Central and Southern America is a major weed both urban and agricultural situations throughout India.Status and seriousness of Parthenium problemIn Imphal city, the weed was reported first by the present author along Imphal-Dimapur road (NH39) at Mantripukhri Truck parking area during 1994. Now, the weed has infested almost all areas of the Imphal city (Sanjenthong area, Wangkhei, Kongba near Meitei Mayek High School, Manipur College road, Singjamei, Kakwa, Canchipur (Indo-Myanmar road); Singjamei-Kshetri leikai, Khongman, Kongba Area; Kongba-Khurai road; both banks of Nambul river such as Waheng leikai, Keishampat, Pisum; Uripok-Iroishemba road; Khwai bazar to Tera bazar (Imphal - Jiri road); Khwai bazar to Mantripukhri (Imphal-Dimapur road); Khwairamband bazar to Khurai road; Khwairamband bazar to Khuman Lampak road; Khuman Lampak road to Khurai; Pishum to Mayai Lambi road including northen side of the Polo ground near Auto boarding/deboarding area).Our aerobiological investigations at 4 sites (Tiddim ground, Keishamthong Elangbam Leikai, Heirangoithong and Wahengbam Leikai) revealed that average number of Parthenium hysterophorous pollen of all the sampling sites were high at a distance of 1m rom the plants in horizontal (580 pollen/m3) and 1.5 m in vertical (530 pollen/m3) in July. Pollen grains of Parthenium were recorded throughout the year. The highest monthly pollen concentration was found in June followed by July and September in horizontal profile. Whereas in the vertical profile the highest monthly pollen concentration was found in July followed by June and September respectively in the four sampling sites. During these months, in Tiddim ground and Keishamthong Elangbam Leikai were heavily infested with P. hysterophorous, the pollen concentration were high as compared to Heirangoithong and Wahengbam Leikai both in horizontal and vertical profiles. Least number of P. hysterophorous pollen grain was collected in December (below 40%) at vertical as well as in horizontal profile in the four sampling sites. The correlation between the frequency of the average pollen number of horizontal and vertical of 4 different sampling sites using t-test was found to be 3.3 at 0.05% significant. The influence of meteorological factors such as temperature, wind speed, rainfall, and relative humidity on the variation patterns in the concentration of atmospheric pollen were studied. It was observed that 250C-280C temperature, 4-5 km/hr wind speed, 60-70% RH, bright sunny and rain free days were favourable for high Parthenium hysterophorous L pollen catch. These weather conditions might be conducive for high discharge, dispersal and deposition of P.hysterophorous pollen. Too low or too high temperature, very high wind speed, high humidity and cloudy and rainy days hindered high pollen catch.Such type of reports were also found from other cities of India. For instance, in Bangalore 40 - 60 % of the total aero-pollen sampled between 1981 and 1986 was from Parthenium suggesting the seriousness of the problem. In another study from Salt Lake City, East Kolkata, clinically 1 out of 6 patients showed ELISA positive reaction to Parthenium.Partheniummenance on human and livestock healthHuman healthPartheniumis known to contain sequiterpene lactone which induce severe allergic reaction in susceptible individuals who are continuously exposed. Itching, eruption developed on exposed parts of the body, particularly the upper eyelids side of the neck, parts of face, V of neck, from elbow and backs of knee.Livestock healthCows passing through patches of Parthenium suffer from inflamed udder, fever and rashes. In addition to itching, popular erythematous eruptions, loss of hair, marked depigmentation of the skin, developments of oedema ulceration and developments of lesions in the mouth and intensive and reduced milk yield when hungry cows eat the Parthenium weed in pastures because it contains harmful compounds.Agents for Spreading PartheniumThe motor vehicles are one of the most important agents for spreading Parthenium seeds from one place to another. Prior to 1994, no parthenium plant was noticed in Imphal city by the present writer. The registration of motor vehicle in Manipur as on 31st March 1991 was 46688 (Truck-4017; buses - 1216; jeeps - 3596; cars - 2214; taxis - 273; two wheelers - 33146; three wheelers - 1292; tractors - 485; tailors - 317 and others - 159). Whereas the registration of motor vehicles in Manipur as on 31st March 2015 was 249978 (Truck- 12709; buses - 1385; jeeps - 1542; cars - 22886; taxis - 4542; two wheelers - 191838; three wheelers - 14310 and others - 766). The amount increased in motor vehicles during last two decades is tremendous. The major portion of this vehicles (60% or more) are in the Imphal west and Imphal east district of Manipur. The frequent movement of the motor vehicle facilitate the spreads of Parthenium seeds in the roadsides of Imphal city resulted heavy infestation of parthenium plants.Management strategiesThere are three methods for control of Parthenium viz, mechanical, chemical and biological.Mechanical control: It involves hand weeding including uprooting of young parthenium plants. It is an unpleasant job and made worst by the health hazards involved in handling Parthenium.Chemical control: It is too expensive for farmers or general public to use.Biological control: It can be perform either classical or bioherbicidal tactics because biological control is considered to be the cheapest and most effective method with minimum impacts.a. Control of Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorous L.) by using sickle pod (Cassia tora L.). The seeds of sickle pods if broadcasted on the Congress grass growing areas will suppress Parthenium through competitive displacement (please refer to The Sangai Express 18th Nov., 2015 issue).b. The Congress grass (P. hysterophorous) can also be controlled using Mexican beetle (please refer to The Sangai Express 15th Oct., 2015 issue).Discussion, public awareness and conclusionThe growth of Parthenium has been observed throughout the year but present with high abundance during June to August. This might be due to congenial climatic condition such as high rainfall, optimum temperature and high relative humidity which favoured the growth of the weed. It has started spreading like a wild fire in the Imphal city and its suburbs. The reason might be due to its prolific seed production and its lightness which could be easily blown through wind and carried away by the moving motor vehicles. It has also its allelopathic effect on other plants. Till now, the weed has been found growing only along the roadside, wastelands and non-crop areas but if it is not controlled at the earliest, it might cause serious problems to the environment as Parthenium pollen causes contact dermatitis, rhinitis, asthma, etc., to susceptible human being and livestock.Thus, the general public need to have awareness about the menace of the Congress grass. We have to realise our responsibility to wipe out this dreaded weed because the delay in addressing Parthenium issue in near future might end up in a great turmoil.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFSdE6CRPZhVG2b3MDpcKH0bKRmEA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=8XBWV9DoDOLszAa7q5SABg&url=http://www.thesangaiexpress.com/imphal-city-call-public-awareness/,EN,,07/06/2016 07:06,2016-06-06 18:22:15+00:00,73016db520,The Sangai Express,,,,,1465244535,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a57258df19,One creature\'s meal is another\'s pain in the butt - Science News Magazine (blog),"One creature\'s meal is another\'s pain in the butt<br />Anyone who\'s had a sandwich stolen out of their hands by a gull at the beach knows firsthand how bold and aggressive these birds can be in their quest for food. But there are gulls that do far worse than steal your sandwich.The absolute worst might be the kelp gulls that pick at the skin and blubber on the backs of Southern right whales[1] off the coast of Argentina. The wounds caused by the birds are thought to kill many right whale calves. But a close second may be the kelp gulls and dolphin gulls on Guafo Island in Chilean Patagonia. That\'s because these gulls are wounding South American fur seal pups as they eat the pups\' feces - straight from the source, a new study reports.Gulls \""are very opportunistic,\"" says Mauricio Seguel, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. \""That\'s one of the things that is so amazing about these birds. They can adapt so easily to so many different environments.\""The kelp and dolphin gulls on Guafo Island have a varied diet, Sequel says. They eat shellfish plucked out of the ocean at low tide. They crack into sea urchins by dropping them from heights onto the rocks. They\'ll steal fish or crabs out of the claws of marine otters. But a big portion of their diet comes from cleaning up after the fur seal colony on the island. The gulls eat placentas left behind after pup births as well as dead pups.Researchers have been monitoring that fur seal colony since 2003, hoping to learn more about the seals\' biology and how changes in the ocean might be affecting the animals. Then in 2008, the scientists started finding wounds in the perineal area of some of the pups they had marked for study. It wasn\'t many pups - just 5 to 9 percent of the pups sampled each year from 2012 to 2017 - but some of the wounds were infected.In 2015 and 2017, the researchers caught the culprits. They spotted kelp and dolphin gulls picking at the butts of pups, all around two-months old, and eating their feces. Fur seal pups in this colony are often infected by hookworms, parasites that cause bloody diarrhea and are responsible for killing about a fifth of the pups each year, Seguel notes. The feces of infected pups are also full of expelled hookworms, and this was what the gulls were eating. The gulls only went after this meal when pups had infections, and they only bothered one of the 30 seals that researchers treated with an antiparasitic drug.The gulls don\'t mean to harm the seal pups, but some clearly are. Seguel and his colleagues found signs that some wounded pups had systemic infections[2] probably caused by the infected wounds, they report July 26 in Royal Society Open Science.The researchers don\'t think that the gulls are having a big impact on the fur seal population. But that could change, Seguel warns. The gulls that are now killing whale calves off Argentina weren\'t a big problem until an increase in fishing and urban waste drove an increase in the gull population. Gulls are very adaptable in their behavior, Seguel notes, and they are easily affected by human activities and can have negative effects on marine species. It\'s another reason, he says, that humans should be careful, since our own activities can have long-lasting, unforeseen consequences for nature.References^ backs of Southern right whales (journals.plos.org)^ had systemic infections (rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH_051s_buWORsku3EeAiy6wSjOtQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=_R2-WcCuL4u46QTOpLPgAw&url=https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/seagull-fur-seal-hookworm,EN,,17/09/2017 07:02,2017-08-04 14:32:09+00:00,a3eed62f3b,Science News Magazine (blog),,,,,1501864329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a5844e5952,"Boy, 7, was tortured to death and fed to pigs. State agencies failed him, says lawsuit. - Washington Post","Boy, 7, was tortured to death and fed to pigs. State agencies failed him, says lawsuit.<br />The family of Adrian Jones, 7, filed a wrongful-death lawsuit after Jones suffered abuse at the hands of his father and stepmother. (KSHB) Adrian Jones\'s short, tortured life was spent isolated from outsiders, confined in filthy, mice-infested houses where he was \""home-schooled\"" by the parents who ultimately killed him, according to court documents. But the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father and stepmother were meticulously documented, through dozens of surveillance cameras. As his family moved from place to place across Kansas and Missouri, his stepmother captured photos of the horrors, images stored online and later recovered by authorities. His was a brief life of great suffering, as described by police and prosecutors. The story has been extensively reported by the Kansas City Star and other local media, including KSHB. In several instances, Adrian was shown[1] strapped to a table and blindfolded, or standing in neck-deep water in the family\'s dirty swimming pool overnight. In other photographs, his mouth looks bloody and bruised, his teeth rotting, his hands swollen from being restrained, the Kansas City Star[2] reported. In another picture, Adrian appears to be tied up with a plate of food in front of him, a bar of soap in his mouth. Adrian Jones (via KSHB 41) Alongside one of the images, reportedly captured from a surveillance camera by the stepmother, there appeared two words: the boy. During his final days in fall 2015, the young boy was trapped in a white-tiled shower stall and left to die, according to affidavits cited by the Associated Press[3]. Prosecutors later said Adrian essentially starved to death. His body was fed to pigs, authorities said. The young boy\'s remains were found in a livestock pen on the family\'s property on Nov. 20, 2015. His father, Michael Jones, told authorities he purchased the swine after keeping the body inside the home for nearly two weeks, the AP reported. A child told investigators he heard Adrian screaming \""I\'m going to die\"" through a vent and his stepmother, Heather Jones, telling him to \""suck it up.\"" Michael and Heather Jones both pleaded guilty last year to first-degree murder and were sentenced to life in prison. Investigators referred to the child abuse case as one of the \""worst things[4]\"" they had ever seen. His disturbing case prompted a state lawmaker to introduce legislation that would penalize adults who fail to report child abuse at home. In the Kansas City area, Adrian became known, hideously, as \""the boy who was fed to pigs.\"" But with his killers behind bars, Adrian\'s family has been left wondering - could the state have done more to prevent the boy\'s death? Records in both Missouri and Kansas reveal a \""seemingly endless series of reports and hotline calls\"" that informed social service and child welfare agencies of the abuse Adrian suffered. So alleged a wrongful-death lawsuit filed in both states this week by Adrian\'s biological mother, maternal grandmother, and oldest sister. It contends that child service agencies failed to keep Adrian out of harm\'s way. \""Despite all the warning signs, the hotline calls, and the evidence of the child\'s mistreatment, they effectively allowed his father and stepmother to continue to abuse, torture, and ultimately murder the little boy, while they stood idly by, writing it all down,\"" the family\'s lawyer claimed in the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that the state\'s intervention was \""limited\"" to instructing Adrian\'s father and stepmother to sign a piece of paper agreeing to stop abusing the boy - \""the legal equivalent of a \'pinky swear.\'\"" \""As it turned out, that signed paper might as well have been A.J.\'s death warrant,\"" the family\'s lawyer, Michaela Shelton, wrote. The lawsuit asks for $25,000 in damages. Representatives from the Kansas Department for Children and Families declined to comment to the Kansas City Star. But a spokeswoman previously released a statement about the case, saying that the agency followed the family as Michael and Heather Jones \""worked constantly to evade our intervention.\"" \""This family moved frequently between Kansas and Missouri, which greatly disrupted continuity of services and evaluation,\"" the spokeswoman said in a statement to KSHB.[5] Officials in both states remained in regular contact, shared information and continued to talk to the family, the spokeswoman said, adding that child welfare workers thoroughly investigated each reported incident of alleged abuse and neglect. \""It is very difficult to assist families who are constantly transient, especially those who move across state lines and thereby deprive the State of any jurisdiction,\"" the statement read. Michael Jones, Heather Jones (Wyandotte County Detention Center via AP) For Adrian\'s first two years of life, he lived with his biological mother and siblings in Lawrence, Kan. After the toddler was found at home unsupervised, he was removed from his mother\'s home and placed in the custody of his father. But within three months of Adrian moving in with his father, Kansas child welfare workers became aware of problems in the home. Hotline calls began pouring in with troubling information: his father had guns all over the house, his stepmother was observed to be high on drugs, according to the lawsuit. Adrian\'s siblings were reported to have suffered significant weight loss and a number of physical injuries, the lawsuit claims. Other calls reported evidence that Adrian was being beaten and choked by his father and stepmother. One hotline caller said Adrian had been spanked to the point where his buttocks were bleeding. Adrian eventually underwent treatment for disruptive behavior and \""parent-child relationship problem,\"" the lawsuit states. His father and stepmother reported that Adrian frequently wet the bed, stole and hoarded food, picked at sores and lit fires - characteristics that the lawsuit says are common in young victims of child abuse. The family temporarily moved to Missouri, where hotline calls continued - one caller reporting that Adrian\'s stepmother would beat \""the living daylights out of the kids for no reason\"" and would sell \""meth\"" out of the home, the lawsuit stated. Records show that Adrian himself opened up about the abuse to child welfare workers. In a July 2013 interview with a Missouri Children\'s Division worker and a police officer, Adrian - then age 5 - said his father would kick him so violently in the back of his head that a \""little bone come out,\"" the Kansas City Star[6] reported. \""My daddy keeps hitting me in the head and punches me in the stomach and my mom keeps pulling on my ears and it really hurts,\"" Adrian said. \""Mommy and Daddy lock me in my room by myself. Mommy and Daddy can\'t feed me.\"" On another occasion, Adrian told a case worker that he was forced to stand in the corner and do jumping jacks and push-ups all day. For a period of several months in 2014, Adrian was placed in a residential treatment center in Grandview, Mo., having been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He was discharged on Sept. 4, 2014, on the condition that his father and stepmother follow an \""aftercare plan,\"" including enrollment in school and therapy. The center did not follow up with Adrian after he was discharged, the lawsuit alleges. A month later, Adrian\'s stepmother emailed the boy\'s therapist at the treatment center, saying Adrian was \""getting to be too much all over again.\"" Leading up to the boy\'s death, his stepmother, Heather Jones, often posted angry rants about Adrian on a private Facebook page, and alluded to wanting to kill him, according to an affidavit obtained by the Kansas City Star.[7] On Christmas Day 2014, the stepmother made a reference to wanting to simulate an episode of \""The Walking Dead\"" in which a character shoots a child in the back of the head. Three days later, Heather Jones posted that she \""might be the next (redacted) and have to feed some pigs a body.\"" Just over a year after Adrian was discharged from the residential treatment center, he died. At Adrian\'s father\'s sentencing hearing, a detective nearly broke down in tears during his remarks, the Kansas City Star[8] recounted. He said the torture Adrian went through was unlike anything he had seen in more than two decades in law enforcement. The detective, Stuart Littlefield, recalled how Adrian was shocked with a stun gun by his stepmother. Littlefield paused his words for 20 seconds - demonstrating how long the shocks would sometimes last. \""Imagine the screams of a 7-year-old boy,\"" the detective said. \""Twenty seconds is a very long time when you\'re in agony.\"" More from Morning Mix \'This is crazy,\' sobs Utah hospital nurse as cop roughs her up, arrests her for doing her job[9] Why violinist Glen Donnelly jumped out of a plane naked playing \'The Lark Ascending\'[10] \'Kill all white people\': Did a suspected Kansas City killer target middle-aged white men?[11]References^ was shown (www.kshb.com)^ Kansas City Star (www.kansascity.com)^ Associated Press (www.kshb.com)^ worst things (www.kansascity.com)^ KSHB.

a584ee1a76,Is the circus still the greatest show on Earth? | MercerSpace.com - Mercer Space,"Is the circus still the greatest show on Earth?<br />My family and I recently attended one of the final performances of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, and to say it was more thought-provoking than a typical circus experience would be an understatement.<br />When Feld Entertainment, the company that owns and runs Ringling Bros., made the announcement that the famous circus was closing for good, my first reaction was disappointment-magnified when I saw that for this farewell tour, they had nearly doubled their prices. We\'ve gone to the circus nearly every time they\'ve been in town, dating back to before we had the excuse of children.<br />Yet, all the stars seemed to be aligning to say that it was time to call it quits. A 60 Minutes episode that aired the week before our circus date profiled an organization called Animal Defenders International, which rescues animals from circuses. By secretly recording beatings and other cruel treatment of animals, they\'ve helped to pass laws in 15 U.S. states and many other countries, prohibiting the use of wild animals in circuses.<br />Coinciding with this was my birthday, which my daughter celebrated the way only young children can-by scanning her room and collecting a few random \""treasures\"" to give to me as gifts. Along with a clothespin decorated as a superhero and a squeezable stress ball, this included a children\'s book called The One and Only Ivan. Inspired by a true story, the book is about a silverback gorilla who lives for 27 years in captivity (along with a couple of elephants). It\'s an excellent book, and after reading it, I was more attuned to the treatment of wild animals in captitvity-just in time for the circus.<br />Till then, my own feelings had been somewhat skewed, because of the well-intentioned but overaggressive past efforts of protesters outside the circus. While approaching the venue with our kids, pamphlets would be thrust into our faces, along with unsolicited verbal descriptions detailing the terrible things being done to these animals. Partly as a reaction to what I considered an obnoxious way to get their message across (protesters of all sorts take note), and in the interest of preserving what should have been, to my mind, an innocent and formative childhood experience, I waved them away-out of sight, out of mind. I figured the pressure from these activists would force Ringling Bros. to modify whatever harmful training methods they were using, and I wanted the circus to continue, so I felt no guilt about my patronage.<br />Though Ringling Bros. won lawsuits filed against them by the Humane Society and ASPCA, they decided to drop the elephants from the circus last year.<br />The animal rights issue is a tricky one-the elephants were gone, but other animals, notably lions and tigers, remained, despite similar accusations of cruelty and inhumane living conditions. The 2017 show includes goats, pigs, dogs, horses, llamas and a kangaroo. Where is the line? Some animals, like dogs, can be trained with rewards, rather than punishments, but when animal rights advocates describe \""tearing tiger cubs from their mothers,\"" I can\'t help but wonder-isn\'t that what we do with almost every domesticated animal, dogs and cats included? And incidentally, if you want to stage an animal act, I for one would be pretty impressed to see a housecat tamer line up a dozen cats and get them all to lay down together.<br />Without the elephants, ticket sales fell dramatically-the half-empty arena at the performance we attended confirmed that. So it was one last time through the overpriced plastic swords, colored lights, and noisemakers that may have sent more than one child into seizure over the years. The circus is loud and bombastic, gaudy and full of bluster, ridiculous and sublime at once; it has no reservations about calling itself \""The Greatest Show on Earth.\"" (One suspects that our current president, who has more than a little P.T. Barnum in him, is waiting in the wings to claim that title.)<br />Cirque Du Soleil has built a successful business without animals, but the Canadian company\'s productions veer slightly too much toward the pretentious for my taste. The thought has crossed my mind, more than once, that it would be very entertaining to see an elephant burst onstage at a Cirque performance, ruining the tastefully designed sets and scattering the performers. But I really didn\'t mind the elephants\' absence at the Ringling Bros. show; for me, the circus has always been more about humans pushing their own limits, whether it\'s performing a quadruple somersault or getting shot out of a cannon.<br />In addition to the loss of their signature elephants, Feld Entertainment pointed to shorter attention spans as an explanation for lower circus attendance. I don\'t know if I accept that-there\'s so much going on at a circus, often at the same time, that it\'s hard to keep track of it all. But I do suspect that something has fundamentally shifted, generationally.<br />In video games and movies, people performing impossible acrobatics is common; in real life and at a distance, even dangerous stunts can pale in comparison. It\'s difficult for most kids, and many adults, to appreciate the dedication and effort it takes to fly on the trapeze, walk a tightrope, or even work a good clown routine.<br />We watched a woman dismount, pass under her horse, and remount from the other side, all while the horse was loping around the ring. If your only frame of reference is what you see in movies, it might not seem that impressive; I\'m reminded of a CGI moment from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers involving a similar maneuver, which seemed to violate the laws of physics and looked entirely fake to my eyes; but maybe for some kids, that\'s more real than reality. The fact that Feld is continuing its shows with licensed characters, like Marvel Universe LIVE!, Disney On Ice and Disney Live!, might support that theory.<br />I\'m hopeful that at some point, we\'ll see a \""next-generation\"" circus tour the area. In the meantime, my family and I soaked up as much of the spectacle as we could-unicyclists, motorcyclists, tightrope walkers, aerialists, ice skaters, acrobats, acrobats who are also ice skaters, and clowns.<br />Goodbye, Greatest Show on Earth. You will be missed.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFKR-ZJudHGO8XrwL7T-gpzfjsYdA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779437580974&ei=nFzbWJi2FdeHWdO-qOAE&url=http://mercerspace.com/2017/03/28/is-the-circus-still-the-greatest-show-on-earth/,EN,,29/03/2017 07:04,2017-03-28 13:47:24+00:00,5b41d61294,Mercer Space,,,,,1490716044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Europe freeze brings deaths, power outages and closures 
BELGRADE, Serbia - Heavy snow and frigid temperatures have gripped large parts of Europe, leading to dozens of deaths, freezing rivers, the grounding of planes and traffic accidents: 
___ 
ALBANIA 
Frigid weather has caused at least four deaths in the last three days In Albania. Snow stopped falling on Monday, but freezing temperatures continue to engulf the whole country. 
A 52-year old Albanian man on Monday died in the town of Golem, 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) west of Tirana. On Sunday, a 53-year old street beggar was found dead in the city of Sarande south of the capital Tirana. 
A day earlier, another 38-year old homeless person was found dead in the port city of Durres west of the capital. A 62 year old man died after sliding from a roof where he was trying to remove ice. 
Scores of villages mainly in the north and northeast have been isolated and power and water cuts have been introduced, including the capital. 
The health and education ministry decided to keep classes suspended for students. 
___ 
BULGARIA 
The situation in northeastern Bulgaria remains critical with heavy snow drifts on the roads, freezing temperatures and power outages that have affected some 2,000 households. 
Emergency teams trying to clear the roads to remote villages were hindered by strong winds. 
Authorities issued a Yellow Code alert for low temperatures across Bulgaria on Monday. 
The cold spell was expected to continue until the end of the week. 
Schools across the country remained closed on Monday. 
___ 
CROATIA 
Freezing temperatures and strong winds have created havoc along Croatia s Adriatic coast, which isn t used to such cold winters. 
Even the sea froze in shallow bays, trapping fishermen s boats to the amazement of locals who haven t seen anything like this in decades. The temperatures in Croatia s tourist centers of Dubrovnik and Split dropped to -7 C ( 19 F ) and strong winds blew off ancient pine and olive trees on the coast. 
Ferries and planes were grounded, and traffic over bridges banned. Water pipes, which are dug just below the surface as is the case in warm climates, have frozen, leaving thousands without running water as authorities tried to figure out ways to cope. 
___ 
THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
According to Czech public radio on Monday, six people are believed to have died of exposure during the latest cold snap, including in the capital, Prague. Meteorologists forecast freezing temperatures to continue in the coming days. 
___ 
GREECE 
Swathes of Greece have been covered by snow, including several islands, some of which have seen more than a meter ( more than three feet ) of snow. 
Temperatures in some parts of northern Greece have plunged to as low as -18 C ( 0 F ). A state of emergency was declared in the municipality of Kymi on the island of Evia, Greece s second largest island after Crete, where the snow in some areas reached two meters ( 6.5 feet ), leading to cuts to electricity and water supplies. 
The small eastern Aegean island of Oinousses reported severe problems from the heavy snowfall, with the local mayor telling Greek media the island had been without landline telephone connections for four days. On the island of Lesbos, drivers needed snow chains to drive just outside the main port town of Mytilene, while heavy snowfall also hit Chios and parts of the southern island of Crete, from where some flights to Athens were cancelled. 
Chios and Lesbos are home to thousands of refugees, many living in precarious conditions in severely overcrowded camps. Many are still living in tents despite the severe weather. Rights groups have slammed the conditions and called on the Greek government to act quickly to reduce overcrowding. 
___ 
ITALY 
Schools were closed in a handful of southern Italy cities not accustomed to such heavy snowfall. Individual schools also closed in Rome and Bologna because heaters weren t working, news reports said. 
The sub-freezing temperatures have been blamed for the deaths of at least eight people and have disrupted road, rail, air and ferry travel. 
___ 
KOSOVO 
In Kosovo, snow continued to blanket the whole country and left many areas without power. 
Police blamed the weather for the death Monday of an ethnic Albanian man whose body was found on a forest road. 
Though all national roads were open, police advised careful driving and low speeds. Rural roads are either blocked or hard to drive. Power has been cut in many areas around the country. 
___ 
POLAND 
The government says 10 people died in the cold Sunday as Poland has been gripped by low temperatures. The deaths bring to 65 the number of weather-related fatalities since Nov. 1, when temperatures started falling to freezing, especially at night. 
The spokeswoman for the Government Center for Security, Anna Adamkiewicz, said Monday that the latest deaths occurred across the country, either outdoors or in unheated summer cottages and abandoned houses. 
The victims were nine men between the ages of 32 and 69, and a 52-year-old woman. 
___ 
ROMANIA 
Bucharest Mayor Gabriela Firea said inmates from two prisons would be put to work clearing snow alongside anti-riot police in the Romanian capital. The inmates working on snow removal are doing so voluntarily, Firea said. 
She said the initiative would help clean up the capital s ice-clogged streets, which are only partially cleared. 
Romania s Energy Minister Toma Petcu said neighboring Bulgaria had urgently asked for extra electricity, but the request was declined since the cold weather has stretched Romania s power grid. 
Petcu said natural gas consumption in Romania could reach an all-time high Monday due to the frigid temperatures. 
___ 
RUSSIA 
In Moscow, two people have died and 190 people with hypothermia have sought medical help in the Russian capital between New Year s Eve and Jan. 8, the last day of the holiday period in Russia, according to Russian news agencies quoting emergency medical official Sergei Gumenyuk. 
The Russian Meteorological Service said the Orthodox Christmas Eve on Jan. 6 was the coldest in Moscow since 1987 when temperatures plunged below -31 C ( -24 F ). Moscow schools, however, opened on Monday after the holiday recess. In Russia s Urals, schools remained closed in the Tyumen, Khanty-Mansiysky, Sverdlovsk and Yamalo-Nenets regions where temperatures of -35 C ( -31 F ) were recorded. 
___ 
SERBIA 
Serbian authorities have declared emergency measures in 11 municipalities in central and southern parts of the country as fresh snow and extremely low temperatures have blocked roads and cut off villages. Despite-28 C ( -18 F ), residents in remote villages on the rough Golija mountain have refused offers from authorities to evacuate their homes during the deep freeze because they won t abandon their animals. 
The mostly elderly villagers said they d rather freeze than abandon their sheep, goats, cows and chickens. 
`` We have wood and food for the animals, '' says Dragomir, one elderly resident. `` We ll wait. '' 
___ 
SWITZERLAND 
Police in the southern Swiss region of Valais say a Russian couple were killed and their two children aged 11 and 15 were gravely injured over the weekend after the vehicle they were travelling in tumbled about 225 meters ( 740 feet ) along a snow-covered Alpine road. 
Officials said the driver had been trying to park on the roadside, and snowy conditions appeared to have led to the deadly plunge into a pile of rocks. The two children were taken to a local hospital before being flown by helicopter to another in the capital, Bern. They were expected to survive, officials said. 
___ 
TURKEY 
Turkish Airlines on Monday canceled 277 domestic and international flights to and from Istanbul s two airports due to heavy snow. Schools around Istanbul also were closed and the Istanbul governor s office said civil servants in the city would be able to leave work at 3:30 p.m. local time. 
Istanbul schools will stay closed on Tuesday as snow continues to buffet the city, halting ferries on the Bosporus Strait that provide transportation for many commuters in the city straddling the narrow gap between Asia and Europe. 
Television news showed cars slithering along slippery roads and students who had been given the day off staging snowball fights and tobogganing in parks blanketed in deep snow. 
At a local coffee shop, stray cats trying to escape the cold snap lined up under heaters warming an outdoor terrace used by smokers.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGoCpQOsO-tnB1ILd1KKXMBbqr-sw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779339816428&ei=5dF5WOihIYvcWsL4quAM&url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/09/europe-freeze-brings-deaths-power-outages-and-closures.html,EN,,14/01/2017 08:07,2017-01-09 16:12:00+00:00,7903d30a98,Fox News,,,,,1483981920,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a58246ae5b,Expanding sheep farmer on completing his new slatted sheep house - Independent.ie,"Expanding sheep farmer on completing his new slatted sheep house<br />Where straw is used to bed sheep the costs can vary from ?6 to ?12 per ewe depending on the length of the winter housing period and on the dry matter pc of the forage fed.<br />In counties where there is not a readily available supply of straw the cost can increase dramatically as we have all witnessed in the last few months.<br />Slatted flooring will also reduce the incidence of lameness and allow 10 pc more sheep to be housed in the same space. A well designed sheep shed can reduce the labour associated with feeding, bedding and handling.<br />Adequate ventilation, water supply, animal feeding and lying space will reduce a lot of animal health issues that commonly occur when all four are deficient.<br />Clifford\'s shed is a portal frame construction with a 3.6m wide central passage which allows adequate space for feeding round baled silage.<br />Solution<br />The plastic slats used in the shed are ideal for ewes at lambing but can become blocked and dirty where hay or unchopped silage is fed. The ideal solution is to feed pit silage or well chopped bales.<br />The other advantage that slatted flooring gives over bedded pens is that the ewe is always standing at the same height relative to the feeding passage.<br />The slatted pens are 4.5m by 6m with 600mm walk through troughs on each side. At a stocking rate of 25 ewes per pen this will allow 600mm meal feed space per ewe allowing for the length of a ewe at two of the corners.<br />This gives a lying space of 1.1 metre squared per ewe which is in keeping with the Department of Agriculture specifications for a medium sized ewe around 70kg.<br />Allowing 600mm of a meal feeding space per ewe was one of Clifford\'s main priorities, especially with a high prolific flock carrying twins and multiple lambs in the weeks prior to lambing.<br />Inadequate feed space can lead to reduced feed intake with shy feeders, can lead to abortions from injury caused by ewes pushing to get to feed and can increase incidence of vaginal prolapse in heavily pregnant ewes.<br />An adequate constant supply of clean water is essential in every animal house.<br />Clifford will install a bowl type drinker in each pen which can be easily cleaned out and will be positioned at a height of 600mm above the slatted floor. Feeding barriers will all have a bottom board 260mm from the floor and a head feeding space of 250mm through which the ewe eats without causing undue pressure to the back of her neck or throat.<br />The costs associated with building slatted accommodation for sheep based on a 1.8m deep tank and a lying space of 1.1m/ewe using the Department of Agriculture\'s reference costs for TAMS II is around ?460 per ewe. For qualifying young farmers like Clifford receiving a 60 pc grant will reduce the cost to ?184 per ewe.<br />This however will increase if the young farmer chooses to build a slatted house for more than 170 ewes as the maximum grant ceiling is based on a spend of ?80,000 for a sole applicant. This equates to a maximum grant of ?48,000.<br />In comparison a solid floor sheep house with penning will cost around ?240 per ewe or ?96 per ewe for the qualifying young farmer.<br />In this case the ?80,000 ceiling will suffice for housing for 330 ewes.

a5aec2abbb,4-wheel-drive Australian adventure on legendary Gibb River Road - Chicago Tribune,"4-wheel-drive Australian adventure on legendary Gibb River Road<br />Ten years ago, my travel partner spent some time bumming around Australia in a four-wheel-drive SUV.She returned with only one regret: skipping the legendary Gibb River Road, a 410-mile-long former cattle route that cuts through the sprawling Kimberley region in Western Australia. Her visit had taken place during the wet season (November to April) - the wrong time to tackle the flood-prone Gibb. The road trip remained on her bucket list until this summer, when we finally crossed it off.<br />RELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR[1]The Gibb River Road is a dirt and gravel road that slices through the Kimberley\'s massive savanna, a sparsely populated stretch home to a mere 35,000 souls and lots of cattle.<br />During the wet season, heavy rains pretty much shut down the Kimberley, swelling the rivers and turning dirt roads to mush. These same rains have created the fabulous gorges, oases and waterfalls that make the Kimberley one of the most magical natural destinations in the world. In the dry season (May to October) the waters recede, the roads are graded, and it\'s all blue skies and sunshine.Our Outback adventure started in June in a sleepy little town called Broome, 140 miles from the west end of the Gibb. It\'s one of the main staging areas for picking up gear and renting cars and trailers for the trek - one that requires careful planning if you don\'t go with a tour operator. Lodging, restaurants, shops and gas stations are scattered. Most people overnight in tents or pop-up trailers, like the one we rented from Crikey Camper Hire (www.crikeycamperhire.com.au[2]). We bought our food in advance, much of it in cans, and had a car battery-powered fridge to store the rest.What the Gibb River Road lacks in amenities it more than makes up for in beauty. The landscape brims with towering, blood-red termite mounds, bloated boab trees and wavy sand-colored savanna grasses, occasionally punctuated by springing wallabies and tropical birds. We saw so many exotic parakeets, parrots and noisy cockatoos, it was like someone had left the cages open in a thousand pet shops.The real stars of the Gibb are the gorges, and the first we visited was Windjana. To enter Windjana Gorge, you walk through a narrow gap in the face of the Napier Range into a lush oasis, rimmed by towering walls of ocher-red rock, million-year-old fossils, and paperbark, cajeput, fig and leichhardt trees.<br />Freshwater crocodiles were lounging in the first pool we encountered during our 2-mile trek along the gorge\'s mostly dry riverbed. Unlike their bigger cousins, saltwater crocodiles (aka \""salties\""), this species isn\'t known for eating people. But the reptiles have sharp teeth and don\'t appreciate humans getting too close, so we decided against swimming.A typical day on the Gibb entails waking at sunrise to the sound of cockatoos, driving through stunning terrain, navigating deep river crossings, swimming in pristine billabongs, playing in waterfalls, hiking through gorges, kayaking deserted rivers, preparing glorious meals under star-spangled skies and falling asleep to the sound of howling wild dingoes.One hundred fifty miles off the Gibb, Mitchell Falls is a rite of passage for many Australians. Getting to it can be treacherous. Luckily we arrived just after the road had been graded, so it wasn\'t too bad, just slow-going.From our campground, we followed a relatively easy hiking trail to the falls. On the way, we passed Mertens Falls, where I took a quick shower in the cascading waters and toured a gallery of ancient rock art painted by aboriginal people tens of thousands of years ago.When we finally arrived at Mitchell Falls, it was obvious what all the hype was about. Four towering falls, each feeding the next, provided so many photo opportunities that we almost filled our camera\'s memory card. The swirling cool water in the billabong above the first waterfall is free of saltwater crocodiles and perfect for swimming. (These falls are relatively close to the coast and some of the lower pools reportedly do have salties.)We also enjoyed smaller, less famous watering holes on the Gibb, such as Matthew Gorge at Mount Hart. This lush garden and pool dotted with colorful lily pads and shaded by eucalyptus trees is nothing less than magnificent. Best of all, we had it to ourselves.When we finally reached the eastern end of Gibb River Road, we were tempted to turn around and do it again. But we\'d run out of time. So we drove the rather boring, paved Highway 1 back to Broome.Our adventure wasn\'t completely over. We took one last four-wheel-drive trek to the Bungle Bungle Range about 30 miles off the highway. This collection of beehive-shaped, red-and-black striped domes wasn\'t \""discovered\"" by the public until the 1980s. That gives you some idea of how large and remote the Kimberley is. Hiking options abound in the canyons here, but a helicopter ride is a must to see the full expanse and majesty of the range (www.helispirit.com.au[3]).How you tackle Gibb River Road is a matter of personal preference - and budget. You can venture out alone with a four-wheel drive, a tent and a prayer, or join an all-inclusive, comfy tour and leave the driving to someone else. (We stayed a couple of nights in one of the high-end, safari-style camps operated by Australian Pacific Touring, and it was very nice. The 15-day Kimberley Complete guided trip with food and lodging is priced at $7,495 per person; www.aptouring.com/destinations/australia/kimberley[4].)No matter how you do it, the Gibb will shake open your cage and set you free. Shake is a very operative word on the Gibb, as the rumble of the \""washboard\"" we encountered on these roads was strong enough to unscrew the lids on food jars. It also shook our wheel loose, sending our left front tire spinning into the bush.Thankfully nobody on the Gibb passes you without checking to see if you\'re \""all right, mate.\"" A couple of new friends helped us get our wheel back on, so we could limp to a repair shop.Even the owner of Crikey Camper Hire was friendly and helpful when we called and told him we needed repairs.\""Threw a wheel?\"" he asked. \""No worries, mate, I\'ve done it myself ... but, most importantly, are you having fun?\""Eric Vohr is a freelance writer.RELATED STORIES:ct-hocking-hills-ohio-travel-0807-20160721[5]References^ RELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR (www.chicagotribune.com)^ www.crikeycamperhire.com.au (www.crikeycamperhire.com.au)^ www.helispirit.com.au (www.helispirit.com.au)^ www.aptouring.com/destinations/australia/kimberley (www.aptouring.com)^ ct-hocking-hills-ohio-travel-0807-20160721 (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGTtjaMbJMu2U1TNQccN-LOqh-qlA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779165598139&ei=12aUV5juLNSIzAbg9YLgCg&url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/sc-driving-gibb-river-road-australia-travel-0802-20160722-story.html,EN,,24/07/2016 07:12,2016-07-22 14:04:00+00:00,d4f07714c5,Chicago Tribune,,,,,1469203440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a5c132bc9b,Happy as a pig on straw: the difference good animal husbandry makes - Irish Times,"the difference good animal husbandry makes<br />To watch Adam Henson[1], my favourite farmer, on BBC\'s Countryfile, giving a scratch to the belly of his favourite sow is sometimes to speculate about how we might have got on with pigs.<br />The notion occurred in the early days of our \""self-reliant\"" experiments - bees, goats, poultry - when half the acre remained untamed and still full of juicy roots of thistles, briars and scutch. A pair of busy bonhams, judiciously controlled, might dig up the land, sift it of roots and dung it, all for free, with an eventual freezer full of pork.<br />This fantasy expired, perhaps wisely, but Henson\'s regard for his friendly pigs can still make me wonder what pleasures we missed. His Gloucestershire old spots, a rare breed, are comfortably housed on straw, with fond husbandry and sorties to rummage in the sun - all of which can, of course, also seem somewhat fantastic compared with the real world of commercial pig farming.<br />Pigs living over gas-producing slurry might be teary-eyed, wet-nosed, nauseated, dizzy beasts in potentially explosive surroundings <br />In the research of Teagasc[2], the State agency that advises pig farmers among others, concern for productive welfare, both human and porcine, has long been high on the agenda.<br />In 1990 this column quoted[3] from an article in the Teagasc journal Farm and Food Research by Dr Brendan Lynch[4], head of its pig-development team. Headlined \""Are pig houses a danger to health?\"", it quoted speculation that \""in the worst conditions, pigs over gas-producing slurry might be teary-eyed, wet-nosed, nauseated, dizzy beasts in potentially explosive surroundings\"".<br />The gases from slurry include ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide and methane. Few years pass, wrote Dr Lynch, without some human deaths on Irish farms from hydrogen-sulphide poisoning. At high concentrations the gas even numbs the warning sense of smell. Methane, which is odourless, can (if rarely) explode.<br />My comments were properly appalled: \""Does an intelligent, lively, affectionate animal have to be penned up between steel bars 168 hours a week, robbed of all natural exuberance and breathing poisoned air, to yield the profit margins of factory farming?\""<br />Nearly 30 years on, with constant advice and education from Teagasc, things have surely greatly improved. Personal, clip-on gas detectors, better ventilation, and more care in managing and pumping out slurry tanks have helped reduce the human risks. But while bedding on straw may indeed produce the happiest pigs, Ireland\'s pig farms are still almost all fully slatted.<br />Supporting the animals on hose-washed grids above their accumulating slurry has several acknowledged risks to welfare, including lameness and bruising. But one that now gets prime research attention is that the pigs, bored out of their busy, inherently inquisitive, minds, may start biting each other\'s tails.<br />Last year, in response to this seemingly common problem, the European Commission[5] issued a recommendation[6] that materials introduced to divert the pigs from such habits \""should be edible, chewable, investigable and manipulable and should sustain the interest of the pigs\"".<br />I learn this from the current issue of Teagasc\'s research journal, in which three scientists based at Moorepark[7], the organisation\'s animal and grassland research and innovation centre, in Fermoy, explore \""the use of different environmental enrichment options to prevent tail-biting in pigs\"" (online in its journal TResearch for autumn 2017[8]).<br />The commonest diversion is to hang chains for the animals to chew on, or lumps of wood - but farmers worry about them swallowing splinters <br />All the pig producers they talked to spoke of the sporadic, unpredictable nature of the outbreaks, unrelated to the number or age of the pigs. The commonest attempt to divert the behaviour is to hang chains for the animals to chew on, or lumps of wood (but farmers worry about them swallowing splinters).<br />The Teagasc team carried out experiments, including the cost of providing the materials. They offered blocks of compressed straw in holders on walls and compared them with hanging plastic toys. The blocks were \""prohibitively expensive\"", at about ?20,000 a year for every 500 sows, and did nothing to reduce the cortisol (the \""stress hormone\"") in the pigs\' saliva. Chewed hay can also clog pumping systems in the tank below.<br />The researchers also tried to find which kind of wood pigs prefer to chew and the cost of providing it. Of beech, larch and spruce, the animals most often consumed the softer, tastier but more expensive spruce (?2,286 a year for a herd of 500 sows).<br />The UK counterpart to Teagasc, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board[9], has produced a whole handbook[10] on \""environmental enrichment for pigs\"", showing happy animals bedded on straw on its cover.<br />For slatted piggeries, it considers the pros and cons of a whole range of \""enrichments\"", among them winding sisal or hemp rope round bars and hanging wood or hessian sacks. Only fresh root vegetables, such as turnips, beet and swede (not parsnips, toxic to pigs), are \""optimal\"", being \""edible, chewable, investigable and manipulable\"".<br />Ireland[11] does, of course, have organic pig farmers of Adam Henson\'s benevolent ilk, but they may be having some difficulty in bedding their animals on straw. A drop in Ireland\'s cereal growing has apparently cut the supply by about a million bales.<br />This autumn, however, does offer organic pigs one enriching treat: a bumper crop of edible and interesting apples.<br />Michael Viney\'s Reflections on Another Life, a selection of columns from the past four decades, is available from irishtimes.com/irishtimesbooks[12]; viney@anu.ie<br />References^ Adam Henson (news.google.com)^ Teagasc (news.google.com)^ In 1990 this column quoted (www.irishtimes.com)^ Brendan Lynch (news.google.com)^ European Commission (news.google.com)^ issued a recommendation (eur-lex.europa.eu)^ Moorepark (www.teagasc.ie)^ TResearch for autumn 2017 (www.teagasc.ie)^ Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (ahdb.org.uk)^ handbook (pork.ahdb.org.uk)^ Ireland (news.google.com)^ irishtimes.com/irishtimesbooks (www.irishtimes.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNG66CWVcR8dBi94DET4nf8bTjsIjQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=DljHWZj6KML9zAbWqqnADA&url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/happy-as-a-pig-on-straw-the-difference-good-animal-husbandry-makes-1.3223991,EN,,24/09/2017 07:00,2017-09-23 03:18:00+00:00,42e448a51f,Irish Times,,,,,1506143880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a5f16d0386,Mic\'d Up?Planned Parenthood\'s Strategy - Church Militant,"Mic\'d Up-Planned Parenthood\'s Strategy<br />The pro-abortion crowd may be driven by evil, but they aren\'t stupid. They are already hedging their bets in case of an overturn of Roe v. Wade and starting a scorched earth campaign to prevent future legal defeats.<br />The 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade legalized abortion on a national level, calling it a fundamental constitutional right. If it is ever overturned, the question of abortion would then devolve to the states.<br />The pro-life movement has turned its attention from Roe itself and has ramped up a campaign of state and local restrictions. These operations, taking place at the grassroots level across the country, have been effective in restricting access to abortion.<br /> <br />As pro-life initiatives and laws begin to choke off the flow of blood, the pro-abortion lobby has changed gears.<br />Instead of bringing out the big guns and appealing to the Constitution itself, in many battles abortion advocates are limiting themselves to state law on purpose. This way they can have legal precedents in their favor to fall back on if the day comes when the Supreme Court decides it\'s a matter  that should be returned to the states.<br />This is exactly what they did in a recent case[1] in a Kansas appeals court during a lawsuit regarding partial birth abortion. Abortion advocates limited their attack to using just the Kansas constitution. The appeals court was split down the middle, and the abortion advocates got their way.<br />The case is to be appealed to the Kansas supreme court, but for now, the abortion lobby has its precedent.<br />We are called to be innocents as sheep but wise as serpents. If the national hemorrhage is to be staunched, the pro-life movement must adjust their strategies accordingly.<br />References^ recent case (www.churchmilitant.com)<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH-JzqMf669RKt6ch5rRjjvNOcCVw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779046125167&ei=hJO9VtiwAsOhauPFhLAL&url=http://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/micd-up-planned-parenthoods-strategy,EN,,12/02/2016 08:11,2016-02-12 00:35:32+00:00,95c728a7b8,Church Militant,,,,,1455240932,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a5fbb03611,Volunteers uncover Native American artifacts at Jug Bay - CapitalGazette.com,"Volunteers uncover Native American artifacts at Jug Bay<br />Archaeologists and dozens of volunteers returned to the shore of the Patuxent River at Jug Bay this week to dig deeper into the prehistoric past.It was a follow-up to a similar, but longer, session early this summer at the River Farm section of the county\'s Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary, where two years ago cultural artifacts were found in 95 percent of approximately 650 test pits dug in preliminary research.<br />Volunteers were on site beginning Wednesday under the auspices of the county archaeology program and the Lost Towns Project, digging 5-foot square \""units\"" into the soil and turning up bits and pieces of our past: pottery sherds, arrow points, flakes of stone from tool making, shells and what looks to be a spot where shellfish might have been smoked on flat stones.\""Look, I found a thing,\"" archaeology intern Megan Hill said, approaching more senior staff with what ended up being a jasper flake, evidence of tool making, but rare in this area.<br />She\'s an intern in the county archaeology program this summer and fall, having participated in the field school offered at St. Mary\'s College of Maryland.\""I just love finding dead people\'s trash in the dirt,\"" she said.That was about the same reaction her cohort, Gwendolyn Frentheway, of Columbia, said.She had taken an introduction to archaeology class in college and saw the announcement for the volunteer dig session in an email.\""It\'s fun finding dead people\'s stuff,\"" she said as she picked through the bits remaining on a screen after she sifted a load of dirt scraped from a unit just feet from the riverbank.The 35 people on hand midday Thursday were scattered in the woods along the shore, digging and sifting.They also sought to find more evidence of a possible structure discovered in June, but by Friday had not had any luck. The evidence discovered in June was a dark smudge in the dirt, about 6 inches wide, indicating a trench method of possible wall construction.<br />\""It\'s a construction technique not found in this area,\"" explained retired county archaeologist Al Luckenbach. \""We see Delaware tribes doing that, but not here.\""Instead of thrusting or pounding posts into the ground for a wigwam or other structure, the curved \""smudge\"" suggests another method - digging a trench to set posts into the softer soil, then back-filling.He added the area has been full of big pottery pieces and little projectiles.The findings here suggest a long connection to the Pig Point site about a mile upstream where he and other county and Lost Towns staff uncovered what appears to be an important ceremonial site occupied over thousands of years.The Lost Towns Project was formed years ago to supplement the work of the county archaeology program and do other work utilizing grant funds to help uncover layers of Colonial and now prehistoric life in Anne Arundel.Stephanie Sperling, River Farm site project manager, says artifacts from 5,000 to 9,000 years old have been found at the site. The older items were found on higher ground a couple hundred yards from the shore.\""I think a lot of the pottery and other small things we are finding are likely coming from uphill,\"" she said.Janis Markusic was volunteering on a dig for the first time.\""I am really happy I decided to do this, although it has been rather hot and humid,\"" she said. \""It\'s like an archaeological playground. It is very interesting to see the artifacts come out of the soil. We found a feature that looks like a hearth, with some charcoal, that we will be excavating this afternoon.\""She said the digging is fun once you get through the top layers of soils and roots.\""Doing the trowel work is fun. And so is sifting where you find the smaller artifacts, which are just as important as the artifacts that come popping out of the soil.\""All the artifacts uncovered, once cleaned, will make their way to the county\'s archaeology lab at Historic London Town and Gardens in Edgewater where they are categorized and labeled, then stored.Volunteer Dave Thompson was just happy to be on solid ground.

a607ac9d5e,The parent trap: Inaccurate records stalling Irish breeding progress ... - Agriland,"The parent trap: Inaccurate records stalling Irish breeding progress<br />Investing in genetics is one of the most important decisions a farmer can make, but much of the good work done could be undermined by inaccurate parentage.<br />Teagasc\'s Prof. Donagh Berry told delegates at the Agri-Food and Bioscience Institute\'s Scientific Outlook conference in Co. Antrim that breeding had already contributed to up to 90% of the improvement in performance in many species.<br />Because it is cumulative and permanent, the gains achieved in any given generation are a function of all gains achieved in the preceding generations.<br />Records<br />However, the effects could be stalled by inaccurate record keeping - particularly parentage.<br />Cork-based Prof. Berry told the crowd research in Ireland showed that up to 13% of commercial cattle and sheep had been registered with inaccurate parentage.<br />Similarly, up to 7% of dairy cattle had been mis-registered.<br />He said: \""I would argue that breeding is essentially free. You have to put the animal in calf or in lamb to get progeny or to get the animal lactating so you might as well put good genetics in there as opposed to bad genetics.<br />When the milk price is low people say I won\'t bother milk recording; I won\'t bother artificially inseminating this year - I\'ll just use a stock bull. If you introduce bad genes into the herd then it is going to be years or generations before you will be rid of them.<br />\""From a management point of view I would actually say vaccinations are costly, using heat detection technology is costly, feeding the animals is costly; it is almost certainly a quick fix solution.<br />\""You can use a seeder and get an animal in calf, but you will probably keep the progeny so it really is exacerbating the situation.\""<br />Image source: TeagascSince EBI - a profit-based index measuring genetic gain in euro terms - was launched, the Republic has seen its genetics rapidly improve.<br />The launch of the south\'s national breeding programme - Gene Ireland - drove genetic gain by ?12 a year. The Republic of Ireland was also second in the world to introduce genomic technology into dairying.<br />\""We launched it in 2009 - that drove genetic gain up to ?25 a year,\"" Berry added. \""If you actually summed up the benefits since the year 2002, today this has been worth ?1.1 billion to the Irish dairy industry.<br />Genetic gain<br />\""There is huge room for improvement in that. That is far less efficient than where we actually should be.<br />\""Vets will tell you breeding is a waste of time and too slow, but we can make genetic progress just as quickly in fertility, TB, lameness or mastitis as we did in milk in dairy cows, if the willingness is there to do it.<br />\""I wouldn\'t recommend we should do it, as what you will end up with is goats as dairy cattle - but the potential is there to do it because there is a load of variability.\""<br />Inheritability<br />Berry added that future research in the field would be likely to surround the inheritability of key traits.<br />\""If you have 10% pedigree errors - if you were to fix them through DNA technology you can increase inheritabilty by 25% straight away,\"" he said.<br />\""If you look at some of the research done in Nottingham, based on good commercial farmers, 5% of the cows were inseminated at the wrong time - there was no way they were going to go in calf.<br />\""As geneticists we don\'t know that information so we just assume she was genetically poor.\""<br />RELATED STORIES",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNElieh3mSX1VyqMHFXVf92NBo_ZgQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779838331555&ei=xhGyWriLBIP-zAbBoYX4BQ&url=https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/the-parent-trap-inaccurate-records-stalling-irish-breeding-progress/,EN,,21/03/2018 08:00,2018-03-20 11:32:27+00:00,09f6823154,Agriland,,,,,1521549147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a60cbc60bf,Indiana Democrats seeking end to their legislative futility - Chicago Daily Herald,"Indiana Democrats seeking end to their legislative futility<br />INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana Democrats say a jump in new candidates on the May 8 primary ballot is a sign that they could cut into large Republican majorities in the state House and Senate that have left them largely powerless over the past six years.<br />Republican voters, meanwhile, will decide numerous contested races, with candidates including the wife and son of former GOP congressmen among those seeking legislative nominations.<br />Here\'s a look at some key primary races involving half of the seats in the 50-member Indiana Senate and all 100 seats in the Indiana House:<br />OPEN SEAT SCRUMS<br />Several long-time legislators decided not to seek new terms this year, leading to packed primary fields for some of the eight open House seats now held by Republicans and five House seats being given up by Democratic incumbents.<br />Those races feature some well-known names, such as Republican Matt Hostettler, the son of former U.S. Rep. John Hostettler, who is seeking an open GOP seat in the Evansville area, running against a Vanderburgh County commissioner and a retired dentist who narrowly lost a 2010 legislative election.<br />Another is Christy Stutzman, the wife of former U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, for a seat from northern Indiana\'s Elkhart County. Marlin Stutzman lost a 2016 Republican primary U.S. Senate bid amid ethics concerns from an Associated Press investigation into the spending of campaign money on hotels, meals and at least one family trip.<br />Former Vigo County Council member Mark Bird, an older brother of Basketball Hall of Famer Larry Bird, is among five Democratic primary candidates for Terre Haute district now held by their party. Gary City Council member Ragen Hatcher, the daughter of former longtime Gary Mayor Richard Hatcher, is one of two candidates seeking the Democratic bid to succeed 18-term Democratic Rep. Charlie Brown.<br />GOP CHALLENGERS<br />Republican Sen. Mike Delph of Carmel, who\'s drawn attention for his outspoken support of tougher immigration restrictions and against recognizing gay marriage, is facing a tough primary fight for his suburban Indianapolis seat. Challenger Corrie Meyer is a former Carmel redevelopment director who has the backing of Carmel\'s mayor and five other current or former Republican mayors in or near the district.<br />GOP Sen. Travis Holdman of Markle is considered a possible candidate to replace retiring Senate President Pro Tem David Long of Fort Wayne as the Senate\'s top Republican. But he first faces a primary challenge from Adams County Councilman Eric Orr in a rural district just south of Fort Wayne.<br />Two northern Indiana House Republican primaries are something of a proxy fight over tactics by anti-abortion groups.<br />The group Hoosiers for Life is backing challenger William Carlin against Rep. Ben Smaltz of Auburn, whom it has criticized for not allowing the House committee he leads to consider a bill aimed at banning abortions in the state. Smaltz has been endorsed by the larger and better-known Indiana Right to Life group, but Hoosiers for Life has described him as \""a wolf in sheep\'s clothing, pretending to be \'pro-life.\'\""<br />The sponsor of that abortion-ban bill, Rep. Curt Nisly of Goshen, faces a primary matchup against Kosciusko County Council member Kimberly Cates. Indiana Right to Life hasn\'t endorsed either candidate.<br />DEMOCRATS SEE OPPORTUNITIES<br />Democrats have nearly two-thirds more candidates seeking legislative nominations this year than they did in the last midterm election four years ago. They ended up with candidates on the November 2014 election ballot in only 68 House districts and 16 Senate districts. They already have candidates in 83 House districts and 19 Senate districts, with time to fill ballot vacancies after the primary.<br />By holding more than two-thirds of the seats in each legislative chamber since the 2012 election, Republicans have enough clout to pass bills even if all Democrats were to boycott votes. Democrats need to add four House seats to break the current 70-30 Republican supermajority, while the GOP\'s 41-9 Senate margin means Democrats must pick up at least eight seats.<br />Indiana Democratic Party Chairman John Zody says the party has seen more interest from millennials and women in running for offices and greater enthusiasm among Democrats since President Donald Trump\'s 2016 election. He said Democrats will be emphasizing the importance of gaining legislative seats to influence state policy on issues such as education funding, improvements to the Department of Child Services and redistricting reform.<br />\""We say we need to pick up seats and come on and help us do that,\"" Zody said. \""We\'re going to pick up as many as we can and we think in the process of doing that we can break the supermajority.\""<br />Mike Murphy, a former Republican legislator from Indianapolis and past Marion County GOP chairman, didn\'t discount the greater enthusiasm among Democrats spurred by opposition to Trump, but while the size of the GOP legislative majorities could be cut he said that doesn\'t necessarily mean a big wave for Democrats.<br />\""Every race, particularly at the legislative level, is very, very local,\"" he said. \""It is very much based on personalities and who is seen in the community and who do people trust.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHyYQGoXYhd6KpMakih3Lx3q2LSag&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779867729745&ei=uqfRWvCfBYXsWafxgqgH&url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20180414/news/304149997,EN,,14/04/2018 07:03,2018-04-14 03:05:37+00:00,6df579530d,Chicago Daily Herald,,,,,1523682337,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25046dabf7,Kesha Announces Rainbow Her First New Album In Five Years for August 2017 Release - mxdwn.com,"Kesha Announces Rainbow Her First New Album In Five Years for August 2017 Release<br />John Wyatt[1] July 6th, 2017 - 3:23 PM <br />Kesha has been circulating throughout the news within the music community over the past few months, though for rather unfortunate circumstances. Back in 2014, Kesha filed a lawsuit against her producer, Dr. Luke, alleging sexual assault and battery, sexual harassment, gender violence, civil harassment, unfair business and intentional negligent infliction of emotional distress. Since news first broke of the lawsuit, a legal battle has unfolded in the media.<br />In Februrary, Dr. Luke claimed he is owned $1.3 million in royalties[2] from Kesha, around the same time her attorneys released emails[3] from Dr. Luke, some containing references to an eating disorder she developed under Dr. Luke. Later, in March, her amended lawsuit was rejected[4] by New York Supreme Court. However, things took a slight turn in Kesha\'s favor when Sony announced that it was ending[5] its partnership with Dr. Luke as the CEO of their Kemosabe Records.<br />Even though the exhausting legal battle is probably far from over, fans should rejoice, even just a little bit. Kesha has announced a new album!<br />Rainbow [6]marks her first album in five years, and will drop August 11 through RCA and Kemosabe records (cya Dr. Luke). The new album will feature Eagles of Death Metal, whom she recorded two new songs [7]with, and Dolly Parton, who will be the feature for a cover of her song \""Old Flames Can\'t Hold a Candle to You.\"" You can check out the album artwork from Robert Beatty (Flaming Lips, Tame Impala).<br />On top of the announcement, Kesha release the record\'s first single \""Praying,\"" which was written about that moment when \""the sun starts peeking through the darkest storm clouds, creating the most beautiful rainbow.\"" The new video starts with Kesha in a casket, presumed dead with pig-men standing over her, drooling (you can figure out the metaphor). \""Am I dead?\"" she asks. \""What is the lesson? What is the point?\"" The new track clearly dives into the emotional and mental turmoil she went through with her relationship with Dr. Luke as she sings calmly over a simple, but strangely uplifting piano melody.<br />\""I hope you\'re somewhere praying,\"" she says calmly. Tension builds and Kesha yells \""the best is yet to come.\"" The song eventually explodes as Kesha starts pounding and wailing, \""I hope you\'re somewhere praying, I hope your soul is changing.\"" The new single tackles some serious and weighty subjects, but Kesha manages to give fans an uplifting and motivational new track.<br />You can check out the new video below.<br />Photo Credit: Sharon Alagna<br />Comments<br />References^ John Wyatt (music.mxdwn.com)^ royalties (music.mxdwn.com)^ emails (music.mxdwn.com)^ rejected (music.mxdwn.com)^ ending (music.mxdwn.com)^ Rainbow (pitchfork.com)^ two new songs (music.mxdwn.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGeyNFdL7dH0_g5_ayzmsFMOY6h8A&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779548084201&ei=uzFfWaD3Nsa2zAaFjICADg&url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2017/07/06/news/kesha-announces-rainbow-her-first-new-album-in-five-years-for-august-2017-release/,EN,,07/07/2017 07:01,2017-07-06 20:23:00+00:00,c1967ab863,mxdwn.com,,,,,1499379780,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a6205951c0,Protesters want pig farmer banned from caring for animals - Norwich Gazette,"Protesters want pig farmer banned from caring for<br />Animal rights activists staged a demonstration Wednesday to deliver a strong message to a local assistant crown attorney and bring attention to one of the province\'s worst cases of animal cruelty.\\<br />Members of Kitchener-Waterloo Animal Save and members of the Brantford chapter of the Canadian Animal Liberation Movement delivered a petition calling for a life-time ban preventing Benjamin Stein from every caring for animals again.<br />Stein, 28 of Tavistock, pleaded guilty to four animal cruelty charges in provincial offences court in Simcoe in January. He was charged after 1,500 hogs died at a farm near Frogmore last year. <br />Inspectors from the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals visited Stein\'s hog operation at 990 Norfolk Road 28 south of Frogmore on Feb. 17, 2017. They found a total of 1,265 dead pigs, many of them victims of starvation and neglect.<br />In one part of the barn, inspectors were forced to wade waist deep in water, animal waste and hog carcasses. The smell was so putrid inspectors cut vents into the side of the barn to let out air.<br />Emaciated hogs that were still alive looked sickly.<br />Veterinarians at the scene euthanized an additional 250 hogs on site. The hogs that survived were nursed back to health at other facilities.<br />At his court appearance in January, Ron Ellis, a London lawyer representing Stein, said his client was suffering from depression and his wife was also battling therapeutic issues at the time.<br />Ellis called the death of the hogs a tragic event for his client, his wife and family noting that Stein belongs to a family of hog farmers.<br />Stein began struggling with mental health issues after a toxic gas incident related to manure storage killed a number of pigs in the affected barn. He didn\'t know how to deal with the setback and fell into depression, Ellis said.<br />Stein is due to return to court before Justice Barry Quinn for a pre sentence report on April 26. <br />\""We want to make sure that, as part of his sentencing, he\'s never allowed to have animals in his care again,\"" Mo Markham, of K-W Animal Save, said. \""We didn\'t hear this being talked about in court before and it\'s something we believe is important.\""<br />The petition has 11,885 signatures and was delivered to the crown attorney\'s office in Brantford on Wednesday afternoon. The demonstration began on Dalhousie Street and members of the two animal rights groups carried signs and walked down to the court house on Darling Street to deliver the petition.<br />The signs were left outside and only a couple of the demonstrators, including Markham, went into the court house to the crown\'s office.<br />The demonstration was held in Brantford because that\'s where the crown attorney\'s office are, Markham said.<br />Members of animal save will also be in court for the April 26 hearing, she added.<br />Although the death of more than 1,500 hogs has been called one of the province\'s worst cases of animal abuse, Markham believes it hasn\'t received the attention and scrutiny it deserves.<br />\""I understand mental health issues,\"" Markham said. \""But you really have to wonder what happened here and what was going on around him.<br />\""I don\'t understand how no one could have known what was going on and how he could just walk a way.\""<br />Part of the problem is that because Stein has pleaded guilty there wasn\'t a trial and as a result the case didn\'t get a lot of media attention.<br />\""I know the local papers covered it and we appreciate that,\"" Markham said. \""But where is the outrage of people.<br />\""Why aren\'t more people speaking out about this. I mean, if it had been cats or dogs that had been left to die like that people would be outraged and would be speaking out.\""<br />J.C. Jantzi, of Brantford, and the Brantford chapter of the Canadian Animal Liberation Movement (C.A.L.M), also attended the demonstration. He wanted to be part of the effort to send a message to the crown attorney\'s office and, if possible, speak to people about the value of veganism.<br />\""Five years ago I had a spiritual awakening,\"" Jantzi said. \""I have always been against animal cruelty but felt I was being hypocritical by eating animals.<br />\""I confronted that and became vegan.\""<br />Not only does Jantzi feel better about himself, he also feels better physically as a result of weight loss.<br />\""My doctor told me I was headed for a heart attack,\"" Jantzi said. \""But I\'ve lost a lot of weight since becoming vegan.<br />\""I always say \'animal products put it on, veganism takes it off.\'\""<br />Jantzi is in the process of building the Brantford chapter of C.A.L.M <br />\""We\'ve been out in the community already and we\'re looking to attract more members,\"" Jantzi said. \""We\'re at the Farmer\'s Market every Saturday and I explain to anyone who is willing to talk and listen the values of veganism.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFY74Pqro56RKCL6VV53mAZokBLSw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=hj_YWrGfGuLIzAbSrYqYBQ&url=http://www.norwichgazette.com/2018/04/18/protesters-want-pig-farmer-banned-from-caring-for-animals,EN,,19/04/2018 07:04,2018-04-18 22:32:04+00:00,7b34ef8790,Norwich Gazette,,,,,1524097924,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a6393d3641,New Desert National Monuments Will Help Protect California\'s Wildest Landscapes - KCET,"New Desert National Monuments Will Help Protect California\'s Wildest Landscapes | Parks | Revisit<br />The White House has announced that three new National Monuments will be designated in the California Desert, covering almost two million acres of some of the wildest, most ecologically crucial landscapes remaining in the state. The monuments, which will be formally announced by President Obama on Friday, will fill in the blank spots in what is now a nearly unbroken chain of protected land stretching from the Southern California coast to the Colorado Plateau.<br />The monuments were originally proposed for protection in legislation written by U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein, who has been trying to shepherd the monuments through a recalcitrant Congress since 2009, asked the White House to wield his power under the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect the monuments if Congress wouldn\'t act.<br />The centerpiece of the designation, and of the Feinstein bill\'s many different versions, is the 1.6-million-acre Mojave Trails National Monument, which stretches along more than 100 miles of the historic Route 66 between Barstow and Needles. Mojave Trails provides a critical wildlife linkage between the Mojave National Preserve and the 29 Palms Marine Corps Base, and through that land to Joshua Tree National Park to the south.<br />In addition to Mojave Trails, the other new monuments are the approximately 154,000-acre Sand to Snow National Monument, which stretches from the northwestern Coachella Valley to San Gorgonio Peak and the borders of Joshua Tree National Park, and the nearly 21,000-acre Castle Mountains National Monument, surrounded on three sides by the Mojave National Preserve and on the fourth by the Nevada State Line near Searchlight. <br />\""Permanent protection of these desert regions will mean a chance of survival for endangered wildlife and rare plants that need space to migrate and adapt in this era of climate change,\"" said Dan Smuts, California senior regional director at The Wilderness Society, which was one of the groups campaigning for the designations. <br />\""Additionally,\"" continued Smuts, \""residents of nearby communities will reap the economic benefits associated with these national monuments, as visitors come to enjoy the unspoiled beauty of the area. President Obama\'s action stands as a tribute to everyone who loves the wide open spaces and starry night skies of the California desert.\""<br />Danielle Segura, Executive Director of the Mojave Desert Land Trust, was quick to point out the benefits that will accrue to communities near the new National Monuments. \""We at Mojave Desert Land Trust have been truly inspired and energized by the myriad voices joining in support of protecting and connecting these landscapes. Our community has a deep appreciation and connection to our public lands that knows no boundaries. Our nation\'s newest national monuments preserve uninterrupted landscapes, ecosystems and opportunities for future enjoyment, discovery and adaptation to a changing biosphere,\"" Segura said.<br />The Sand to Snow National Monument will connect Joshua Tree National Park, in foreground, with the San Gorgonio Wilderness, in background | Photo: Chris Clarke | KCET<br />The choice to pursue Antiquities Act designation for the monuments meant that some lands Feinstein\'s bill would have protected were left out today. Under the Antiquities Act, the President can designate National Monuments, but he or she cannot effect land transfers between agencies, nor does the Antiquities Act allow designation of other protected statuses such as Wild and Scenic Rivers or Wilderness designation. The original bill crafted in 2009 would have designated four new Wild and Scenic Rivers in the California desert, established wildernesses and wilderness study areas, and transferred almost a thousand acres of BLM land near Anza Borrego Desert State Park to the State Parks system.<br />The Feinstein bill would also have added around 65,000 acres to the three desert National Parks in California, and established an Alabama Hills National Scenic Area near Lone Pine. <br />More controversially among environmentalists, the bill would also have established a system of federally designated off-road vehicle recreation areas throughout the desert, a provision that kept the bill from being fully supported by a few organizations, the Sierra Club among them.<br />None of those non-monument designations proposed in Feinstein\'s bill will be reflected in the designation announced today, though the Senator\'s bill would have added what\'s now the Castle Mountains National Monument to the Mojave National Preserve. In that sense, Republican opposition to the bill may have ended up shooting one of the party\'s key desert constituencies in the foot, by making it far less likely that those off-road areas would ever be given formal Federal status.<br />The Marble Mountains in Mojave Trails National Monument, with the Mojave Preserve\'s Granite Mountains in the distance | Photo: Chris Clarke | KCET<br />Born of the Renewable Land Rush <br />Much of the original impetus for today\'s designation can be found in the first weeks of the Obama administration, when a confluence of a Bush-era energy development law covering public lands and a new, more renewable-energy friendly White House spurred a renewable energy gold rush on the lands now designated as National Monuments. That\'s especially true for the sprawling Mojave Trails, much of which was acquired in earlier years by the Wildlands Conservancy and transferred to the Bureau of Land Management for conservation. When renewable energy development proposals started popping up on some of the lands the Wildlands Conservancy had bought, the group turned to Feinstein for help.<br />Feinstein was a logical choice: in her first term as Senator, she\'d shepherded an earlier desert protection bill championed by retiring Senator Alan Cranston to passage as the Desert Protection Act of 1994. That bill established the Mojave National Preserve, and \""upgraded\"" both Death Valley and Joshua Tree from National Monuments to National Parks. It also carved out the so-called \""Castle Mountains Exclusion\"" from the Mojave Preserve, due to an active gold mine in the area. Much of that exclusion is now protected within the Castle Mountains National Monument. <br />In the first months of Feinstein\'s proposal to protect the so-called \""Catellus lands\"" -- land the Wildlands Conservancy had acquired from a railroad holding company -- within what is now the Mojave Trails National Monument, renewable energy development fever was high, and the Senator took some heat by energy partisans who claimed her interest in protecting habitat was anti-environmentalist.<br />Energy development influenced the designation of the Sand to Snow National Monument as well. The lower elevations of that monument abut the San Gorgonio Pass wind development area, one of the most heavily enturbined places in the world. Locals had fought both the Green Path North transmission line proposed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which had been planned as a way to bring theoretically renewable electricity to Los Angeles from the desert. Before Los Angeles dropped the proposal, parts of Sand to Snow such as the spectacular wildlife habitat in Big Morongo Canyon were considered as potential rights of way for the power lines. <br />In subsequent years, wind developer Element Power proposed to build wind turbines atop two local mountains, Black Lava Butte and Flat Top Mesa. Element withdrew from that proposal, but locals were spooked. Both Black Lava Butte and Flat Top were at first suggested for protection as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern, a BLM administrative designation. Today\'s designation includes the mountains as a northern unit of Sand to Snow National Monument.<br />The Castle Mountains, with the mine in the foreground that led to their exclusion from the Mojave Preserve in 1994 | Photo: Chris Clarke | KCET<br />The Soul of the Desert<br />The Mojave Desert is one of the least-trammelled, least-exploited ecosystems left in North America. Even in the age of Google Earth and iNaturalist, it\'s largely unexplored by science. <br />But the planet is getting a lot smaller, and the Mojave is wedged uncomfortably between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. It\'s no news to long-time readers here that the desert is under increasing threat, from ill-considered groundwater export schemes to once-rampant energy development to suburbanization.<br />I have spent a lot of time at KCET casting sidelong, critical glances at the Obama administration\'s acts in the Calfornia desert. It\'s unlikely that many will remember the disappointments 200 years from now, the flimsy wind turbines and fragile solar fields. Thursday\'s designation will thus likely form the centerpiece of Barack Obama\'s legacy in the Mojave Desert.<br />It\'s an important move, and it changes things around here. I see the Sand to Snow National Monument each morning when I open my kitchen door to toss my coffee filter into my worm composting bin. Mojave Trails is a short drive away by desert standards: a mere 45 minutes or so. In a community like Joshua Tree, increasingly dependent on tourism to keep its economy afloat, a few dozen extra visitors a day, or a few hundred, might mean local kids have a better chance of affording college.<br />And this designation helps that in two ways. One, by adding a couple more monuments to the area, so that people whose vacation plans center around checking parks and monuments off their life list will be more likely to visit. And two, by helping to forestall the ongoing conversion of so much desert to industrial use, which isn\'t the most effective draw for tourists seeking wild landscapes.<br />There\'s more to designation than attracting tourists, of course. 1.8 million acres of land in the California desert now bears greater protection, and that means the wildlife on those acres is far less likely to have its habitat destroyed for some short-term social gain.<br />\""This is a historic moment for the Mojave Desert,\"" said Dr. Jim Andre, Director of the University of California\'s Granite Mountains Desert Research Center. \""Designation of these national monuments provides us with the opportunity to ensure permanent protection of critical habitat for thousands of species of plants and animals, including the iconic bighorn sheep and desert tortoise. At a time when our deserts face increasing threats from climate change and fragmentation from development, we must act now to protect sufficient habitat and ecological linkages vital for the long-term sustainability of native desert biodiversity.\""<br />The litany of places protected by these designations reads like a California Desert Rats top 10 list. The Mojave Trails National Monument protects Afton Canyon, one of just three places in the Mojave where the Mojave River runs aboveground year-round. It also includes the Amboy and Pisgah volcanic craters, the Bigelow Cholla Garden and the Trilobite Wilderness. Sand to Snow includes both the Whitewater and Big Morongo canyons, stunning gorges carved into the mountains above the San Andreas Fault that provide crucial wildlife migration corridors in a rapidly urbanizing part of the desert.<br />And Castle Mountains National Monument, which fills in most of that hole in the Mojave National Preserve left by the 1994 Desert Protection Act, is a botanical wonderland, with a startling diversity of desert shrubs above the westernmost extension of the Southern Great Plains grasslands. On a very recent visit to Castle Mountains, the National Parks Conservation Association\'s David Lamfrom -- who lobbied hard to get Castle Mountains included in the list of new National Monuments -- told me that few scientists had spent time cataloguing the Castle Mountains\' biological and cultural resources.<br />And those resources are there in abundance. Castle Mountains lies in a narrow band along the west bank of the Colorado where Mojave yuccas from California overlap with banana yuccas from the Colorado Plateau, a hint at the botanical exchange that\'s taken place over the millennia in this corner of the desert. The Monument is likely to have abundant cultural resources as well. <br />\""The Castles lie between the New York Mountains, which had abundant water and game, and Spirit Mountain, which was sacred to most of the Native people in the area,\"" said Lamfrom. \""So it makes sense that people would have found this range important.\"".<br />Protecting these places in perpetuity is an act of wisdom, a caretaking that will be applauded by generations to come, both of desert residents and of those who come to visit. It\'s been a long time in coming, with a lot of toil involved along the way. <br />And I suspect David Lamfrom spoke for many of those who worked to make this designation happen when he told me \""the sun will shine on the desert a little differently for me today.\""<br />A view across the Castle Mountains NM to the Castle Peaks in the Mojave preserve | Photo: Chris Clarke | KCET <br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEpxSEmWlDh1N_I6dsxeQy5cILIhg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779046091227&ei=W5G9VuCzDtrya6_SssAJ&url=http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/revisit/parks/new-monuments-will-help-protect-californias-wildest-landscapes.html,EN,,12/02/2016 08:01,2016-02-12 06:30:53+00:00,2149121cdb,KCET,,,,,1455262253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a6447cc4a2,Biting My Tongue Because Lions Will Lie Down With the Lambs - Aleteia EN,"Biting My Tongue Because Lions Will Lie Down With the Lambs - Aleteia.org<br /> We must admit that the practice of mercy is waning in the wider culture. In some cases the word seems to have dropped out of use. However, without a witness to mercy, life becomes fruitless and sterile, as if sequestered to a barren desert.-Pope Francis, Misericordiae Vultus, para. 10<br />The poignant, personal statement by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg about the death of Antonin Scalia, and the ensuing details of their warm friendship, has brought to mind the close relationship I enjoy with some of my own family members who serve in the political arena - loved ones with whom I have deep differences over the issue of abortion.<br />My teeth were cut on the campaign trail, as I grew up in a highly political family of Louisiana Democrats, wherein one or more of my immediate relatives have held public office almost continuously since I was born in 1960. Memories of my childhood are replete with door-to-door canvassing, rallies and working long hours alongside my siblings and cousins in various campaign headquarters in New Orleans. There we answered phones, ran endless copies of flyers on Xerox machines and addressed, stamped and sealed envelopes until our fingers were raw. At rallies, we handed out yard signs and bumper stickers, blew up hundreds of colored balloons with helium and sang homespun songs for our candidates. Politics, and its inherent idealism of making the world a better place, was at the center of our lives.<br />Our boisterous Catholic clan was extremely family oriented, with two lone brothers spawning 19 children in fewer than a dozen years - my parents\' 10 and Uncle Moon and Aunt Verna\'s nine. Sundays included shared lunches at Grandma\'s house after church, where we lingered to play jacks, card games and jump rope over the dueling smells of Paw Paw\'s sweet pipe and Uncle Moon\'s strong cigar. I adore the smell of pipes and cigars to this day, as both instantly transport me back to memories of family gatherings over Grandma\'s rump roast and gravy.<br />Summers brought us all together at the rustic camp that Grandma bought on Lake Pontchartrain in 1963, where swimming, fishing, boating, skiing and crabbing kept us, and many of our friends, entertained from dawn until dark in the scorching Southern heat. The pinnacle of summer was our Fourth of July celebration, when we raised the family flag that rested on Paw Paw\'s coffin when he died in 1967, and then recited the Pledge of Allegiance and read aloud the Preamble of the U.S. Constitution. Uncle Moon\'s short speech about appreciating the gifts of freedom and democracy that we enjoy in our great nation preceded the singing of \""America the Beautiful.\"" We were proud to be Americans and Landrieus.<br />Sadly, the winds of change crept in during those precious years, bringing with them drugs, rebellion, a confused post-Vatican II church, contraception, radical feminism and the new law of the land, abortion on demand. I was swept up into much of the Cultural Revolution, but somehow, by God\'s grace, I always knew with certainty that abortion was wrong. Whether it was the Natural Law or the sensus fidei at work, no one ever had to tell me that killing an unborn child in its mother\'s womb was a grievous offense. Furthermore, no one had to convince me that a pregnant woman was carrying an actual child, given the fact that I had nine siblings and numerous cousins, with almost half of them younger than I.<br />Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, the year I became a teenager. I didn\'t think much about the issue of abortion until senior year in high school, when a close friend of mine became pregnant and had an abortion. Suddenly, what had previously been clearly wrong was now a \""necessary choice.\"" Freedom became associated with the ability to choose for oneself, and even the ability to define reality according to one\'s own perceptions. Thus began the slippery slope that slid our nation headlong into 60,000,000 aborted babies, with some of my family members ultimately leading the national charge for abortion rights by way of their political power.<br />I\'ve prayed, fasted and grieved hard about my family\'s pro-choice stance over the years - the issue that eventually pushed me firmly into the Republican Party by default. When possible, I\'ve tried to persuade those I love to see the light. Some conversations have gone well, others not so much.<br />I imagine that Justice Scalia must have felt real grief over what he saw unfold before his eyes during his long tenure on the Supreme Court - not only because he was a jurist who believed that the Constitution nowhere permitted a woman the right to abort her child, but also because he was a devout Catholic who firmly believed in the sanctity of human life. Even so, he worked side by side and apparently enjoyed intimate friendship with people who assumed a completely different stance than he did on abortion (as well as on marriage and other moral issues). I was genuinely surprised to learn this fact about him but am heartened by his example, especially during this Year of Mercy when Pope Francis is challenging us to rethink the way we go about relationships, especially at a time in history where mercilessness and rancor seem to rule the day.<br />There is a time and a place to stand strong for what we believe, particularly when standing firm for what is right and true affects the direction our future takes, both individually and corporately. But there is also a time and a place to put painful, divisive things aside for the sake of strengthening relationships, for the sake of growing in understanding of one another, for the sake of cultivating friendship.<br />Humility and charity demand that we don\'t have to fight at every chance we get, don\'t have to win every argument or prove we are right all of the time (or even most of the time for that matter). In fact, sometimes we win more through listening, through kindness, through love. That\'s one thing that Scalia\'s towering legacy is saying to me, and I am taking note.<br /> <br />Judy Landrieu Klein is an author, theologian, inspirational speaker, widow and newlywed whose book, Miracle Man, was an Amazon Kindle Bestseller in Catholicism.

a654de8bbc,How many people in uniform does it take to rescue a dead duck? - DutchNews.nl,"How many people in uniform does it take to rescue a dead duck?<br />The animal rescue official inspects the wisteria. Photo: DutchNews.nlHow many people in uniform does it take to kill a duckling? In the case of the duckling born on top of a five-floor block in Amsterdam west, the answer is 13 - which was certainly unlucky for the bird itself.It all began when a neighbour alerted the animal ambulance people to the presence of a female mallard and one tiny duckling, which were stuck on the parapet, 20 metres up above a street in the 19th century zone.The duck had obviously given birth to her hatchlings somewhere on the roof but had now found herself on a narrow edge with no access to food or water for her brood.The animal ambulance people went up to the top floor flats armed with nets in an effort to catch the hapless family.... who of course did not want to be caught.CageThere was much too-ing and froo-ing and waving of arms and eventually the duckling  was caught - a tiny little thing which peeped plaintively as it was put into a cage and set on a table in the street.Mother duck was by this time frantic, flapping back and forth across the street looking for baby. Well, I say baby, but apparently there were two - and one duckling which had been spotted earlier in the afternoon, had completely vanished.Where ever could it be? We, the neighbours, the animal ambulance people scoured the plants in our geveltuintjes and looked under cars. There was a faint peeping sound. It appeared to come from our drain pipe.PeepThe animal ambulance people got out a stethoscope and started listening at the pipe. They decided duckling had fallen in and was stuck in the bend at the top.We politely explained we were not that keen on having our drain pipe - which is fairly old and fragile - taken off to search for a day-old duckling - which of course immediately branded us as hideous animal killers.The animal ambulance people went into a huddle, refused to tell us what they were planning and called the fire brigade who turned up with not one, but two fire engines and nine firemen.The fire brigade were out in force. Photo: DutchNews.nlNow, I should stay at this point I have always had a soft spot for firemen and in my days as a cub reporter would always volunteer to go out to fires so I could get to meet them.I\'m afraid the squat little balding man with a big ego and a short fuse who refused to shake hands rather put me off.He told us that we could not stop him dismantling our drain pipe and - pompously - that the fire brigade is there for \'man and animal\'. When we explained the drain pipe is old and could crack, he started waving around a very large and heavy wrench in a most menacing way.PoliceAt that moment, two police officers arrived to order the crowds who had gathered in some numbers and were all filming the fire engine ladder which was by now up at the roof. The two firemen in the cage were pulling and shaking the drain pipe.We watched as they pulled off the top bit with the bend and found nothing. Gradually they came lower. Each piece of pipe was thoroughly inspected. Each was empty.Eventually they got down the wisteria, which winds its way around the pipe and, though still in bloom, was just over its best. As they started trying to peel it off, I lost my cool completely and shouted at the top of my voice; \'My beautiful plant and all for a fucking duckling\'.They did stop there... not because of my shouts but because the bottom piece of pipe  was dug into the ground. To get that out, they would have had to break open the street, and perhaps that was going just a tad too far for a duckling?They did open the drain for a check and put in a camera. Then, after more huddled conversation, they gave up.OrphanThey attempted to put back the drain pipe but not very well and we are now in the middle of emergency repair and insurance claim chaos.The one duckling that was saved was taken off to the asylum as an unwilling orphan, leaving its panicky mother behind.And what happened to the other mystery duckling? Seems pretty obvious to us. If it was stuck in the pipe - and no-one knows for sure - when they started shaking the top, it probably dislodged and fell 20 metres to the ground, breaking its neck.In all the exercise took several hours, a hell of a lot of manpower, a lot of iphone storage space and god knows what the final bill will be... and all for a tiny duckling that will probably get eaten by water rats anyway.The irony being that those firemen accusing us of hating animals all probably went off home and tucked into a nice factory-farmed piece of pork or had a broodje kroket in the canteen. Hypocrisy at its finest.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH1CVYwqBo-XttseDdVoPxCBJg2PQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=Mrt7W7GiGcfi6QSY-ZuYDw&url=https://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2018/08/how-many-people-in-uniform-does-it-take-to-rescue-a-dead-duck/,EN,,21/08/2018 07:08,2018-08-20 06:44:00+00:00,ece86a9f0a,DutchNews.nl,,,,,1534754640,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a66cc9f80d,Why ghee is the elixir of life - Daily News & Analysis,"Why ghee is the elixir of life<br />I, like most Indians, grew up eating ghee and relished every drop of it. In the late 80s there was this vogue of banishing ghee from your diet because it seems ghee was fat and would make one fat , obese and unhealthy. Whenever I asked how come something which never made anyone fat or unhealthy for about 5000 years , now suddenly started making people sick? I always got just one line \""ghee is saturated fat and it will make you fat and your cholesterol will increase and you will get heart disease\"". So basically i joined the bandwagon of  ignorant idiots, confident that I\'m doing something good for myself and completely banished ghee in the 90s.<br />I am someone who take fitness really seriously and not just for the sake of cosmetic value. I have a  rigorous workout routine of freehand and suspension training and cardio daily and i don\'t have any sort of junk food, meat , sugar or dairy , processed foods or drinks , packed juices, etc. I have had this routine for many decades now. About 3 years back after a doctors visit when i saw my lipid profile I was quite disappointed that even after doing the right thing my lipid levels were not satisfactory. That got me thinking and I was hell bent on correcting this the natural way. I suddenly remembered  a doctor in India who about 9 years back told me that Ghee actually reduces LDL and triglyceride levels and elevates the HDL levels.<br />I very soon deduced that there was something wrong with my food we are cooking at home. After doing my due diligence realised that i was using the worst oils in the planet namely , canola , safflower and sunflower and sometimes corn. So actually in an instant I threw out all oils , went out bought cold pressed organic coconut oil and ghee. I started putting Ghee in everything , daals, roti, parathas , toast (since we don\'t have butter), oatmeal, salad and  even drank it pure. The result of having Ghee this way for about 65 days was that my HDL levels increased , my LDL level dropped a lot and my triglycerides dropped by about 130 points. I\'ve gotten my lipid profile checked every 6 months there on and my doctor is in love with my blood report and completely baffled with results when no medicines were involved. He is a Caucasian American with no exposure to Ghee at all and someone like him has started taking ghee  and gave up meat because I presented him with certain facts.<br />At this point you might be thinking that I\'m not making sense at all and that how could I use a saturated fat to balance my lipid profile? <br />Now let me try and explain why this nectar has been used for thousands of years and how it has benefited humans.<br />People avoid Ghee saying that its saturated fat. Yes it is fat but is not \""fattening\"". Saturated fats are not evil in fact they are needed for your to survive.<br />Ghee contains Omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids along with vitamins A, D, E and K2 and 9 Phenolic antioxidants.<br />Butyric acid, also known as butyrate, is a short chain fatty acid (SCFA), that the intestinal tract thrives on, as it helps to protect the integrity of the gut wall. Much of the healthy fibre that we eat directly feeds the intricate microbiology in the gut. In turn, the gut bugs convert this ingested fibre to butyric acid, the primary ingredient in ghee. So your gut bugs literally make their ghee and that\'s why when you consume ghee it aids in digestion.<br />Ghee made from organic butter from pastured grass fed cows has the highest natural source of CLA (conjugated linoleic acid). CLA is extremely important as it boosts the immune system and keeps cholesterol levels in check. It is anti-carcinogenic. CLA has been shown to decrease skin, liver, breast and colon cancer in a vast number of animal studies.<br />Ghee has a full spectrum  of MCFA\'s (medium chain fatty acids) and SCFA\'s (short chain fatty acids) and LCFA\'s( long chain fatty acids). The MCFA\'s and the SCFA\'s specifically kill the harmful micro-organisms and keep menacing bacteria and fungi under control. Your Heart prefers the saturated  fats in Ghee as a fuel and a great source of fuel for energy expenditure<br />Ghee has been used for centuries as a digestive and elimination aid, for energy, sexual vitality, skin and eye health, as a lubricant for the joints and for alkalising the blood. Ghee has one of the highest flash points (251.66ºC) which make this oil the best choice for high temperature cooking. Other than Ghee and coconut oil , every other oil turns rancid when heated . People think they\'re eating healthy because they cook in olive oil. Well let me please inform you that people who cook in olive oil are actually harming themselves. Olive is not meant for cooking , it cant be heated and is meant only as an additive to foods and that too at room temperature. The smoke point for olive oil is about 71.11ºC and the average stove top temperature is a minimum of about 93.33ºC .<br />No vegetable oil is safe for consumption at all! They are processed to death and made by an unnatural process from the start.<br />Fatty acids in Ghee  actually burn other fats in our body leading to fat loss (I have lost about 48 pounds or 21.77kgs  in 10 months after switching to ghee). Ghee is perfect for lactose intolerant people since there are no milk solids in ghee , no casein and no lactose.<br />Let me try and specify the uses and benefits of this blessing in bullet points so that my readers could register them easily.<br /> - Ghee contains Omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids along with vitamins A, D, E and K2<br />- Contains CLA a very important fatty acid with anti-carcinogenic properties<br />- Ghee has a full spectrum of fatty acids , Short , Medium and Long chained<br />- Ghee  has useful anti  viral agents (caprylic acid) and anti fungal agents (lauric acid), prevents plaque<br />- Ghee actually lowers cholesterol (Palmitic and Stearic acid)<br />- Modulator of genetic regulation and prevent cancer (butyric acid)<br />- Ghee is crucial for proper nerve signalling. Ghee has certain saturated fats that function directly as signaling messengers that influence metabolism , including critical jobs as the appropriate release of insulin<br />- Saturated fat is needed for Calcium to be effectively incorporated into bone.<br />- Improves Liver health due the presence of MCT\'s (Medium chain triglycerides)<br />- Believe it or not but your brain is made up of fat and cholesterol and the lions share of the fatty acids in the brain are actually saturated fats<br />- Ghee is regularly used in Ayurveda for treatment of ulcerative colitis, gastric , peptic and duodenal ulcers.<br />- Ghee is the best moisturiser available to mankind. I fail to understand the attraction for chemicals in the name of moisturizing the body<br />- Apply Ghee all over the body massaging it on the head , chest , limbs , joints and orifices. This will bypass the digestive system and allow the qualities of ghee to penetrate directly into the deeper tissues. It is said that 60% of whatever you place on your skin is absorbed in the body.<br />- Have a tablespoon of ghee first thing in the morning for oleation of the internal organ and dissolve  the toxic waste in the tissues allowing them to be carried to the digestive tract for elimination. - And if you follow it with hot water , it will promptly produce a bowel motion.<br />- Best for oil pulling of the mouth which is essential for dental hygiene . Take tablespoon of ghee first thing in the morning and rinse for 10-15 minutes very slowly without swallowing any of it. all the tartar and plaque which brushing and flossing simply cant remove will be pulled by ghee.<br />- In a tablespoon of ghee put two pieces of Kapoor  (Camphor ) and heat it till the Kapoor completely dissolves in the ghee. Apply this mixture to joints and muscles daily either when injured or suffering from arthritis, the relief is absolutely astonishing.  I do this everyday and apply it to my feet in the morning and night before sleeping.<br />-  The anti-microbial properties of Ghee makes it the best first aid for cuts , scrapes , bruises and burn wounds.<br />- Ghee contains all the good fatty acids to induce hydration in your skin. Warm up some ghee and apply it with gentle massage on your face. After about 20 minutes wipe off the excess with a warm towel. You will the difference in a weeks time. No cream can ever come close to ghee.<br />- Use it as a lip balm instead of using a chemical balm<br />- Make an equal blend of ghee and coconut oil and apply in your hair. After 30 minutes wash it off with a mild herbal shampoo. If you have dandruff then too will be treated.<br />- Apply it under your eyes and on your eyelids in the night before sleeping. you will notice your dark circles getting lighter and your getting more refreshed.- <br />Choose you Ghee wisely. It is only as good as its source. Should come from organic and non GMO milk.<br />Please make sure to have a good exercise regimen if you want to use ghee for its benefits. If you have a sedentary lifestyle and then consume ghee you will not see benefits and it might actually harm you . So please respect yourself , be active , exercise and use ghee.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGJyqmWlkEId5MOLpSXoKqry5xe-Q&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=5-ksWvCJNpWrWJCFsMgF&url=http://www.dnaindia.com/health/column-why-ghee-is-the-elixir-of-life-2566459,EN,,10/12/2017 08:00,2017-12-10 02:46:56+00:00,73016db520,Daily News & Analysis,,,,,1512877616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a677f8769b,Using Viruses to Boost Mesothelioma Immunotherapy - Asbestos.com,"Using Viruses to Boost Mesothelioma Immunotherapy<br />Immunotherapy through clinical trials is becoming a promising treatment option for some mesothelioma patients.<br />Checkpoint inhibitor drugs, such as Keytruda, already have U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as first-line treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), edging immunotherapy drugs closer[1] to becoming a viable second-line therapy for other thoracic cancers, including pleural mesothelioma. <br />However, overall response to immune therapies remains relatively low. <br />Researchers across the country are striving to enhance responsiveness to immunotherapy drugs. Leading that trend is viroimmunotherapy, or the process of combining cancer-killing (oncolytic) viruses with immunotherapy drugs. <br />Dr. Manish Patel, an assistant professor in the division of hematology, oncology and transplantation at the University of Minnesota, has studied the potential of virus therapy for mesothelioma for several years. <br />His research led to an ongoing clinical trial at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, investigating the side effects and optimal dosage levels of using a genetically altered measles virus[2] to kill mesothelioma tumor cells. <br />Patel and Dr. Alexander Dash of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, recently published a paper in the journal Biomedicines that analyzes measles and other oncolytic viruses as potential viroimmunotherapy treatments for pleural mesothelioma and other thoracic cancers. <br />As research continues, Patel believes the day of using viruses to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy drugs is not as far off as some may think. <br />\""I think as we go down the line of combining with checkpoint blockade and looking at different viruses, we may see that we start seeing more efficacy; however, for mesothelioma, that may take a few years,\"" Patel told Asbestos.com. \""We\'ve got the measles virus that really is going to be in phase II testing now, and so I think if we\'re able to demonstrate efficacy in that study, we may well be able to get an FDA indication in the next two to three years.\""<br />Viruses Help the Immune System Recognize Tumors<br />Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda), allow the immune system to fight cancer cells by negating the PD-L1 protein, which usually prevents an immune response. <br />A recent clinical trial showed significant tumor reduction[3] in more than half of pleural mesothelioma patients given pembrolizumab as a second-line therapy. The FDA recently expanded approval for pembrolizumab after the drug nearly doubled the effectiveness in patients diagnosed with NSCLC. <br />\""I suspect that immune checkpoint blockade will be approved for mesothelioma as well once we get more information,\"" Patel said. \""In fact, we\'re already using [immune checkpoint inhibitors] as an off-label for many patients.\"" <br />But, irrespective of tumor type, only a small percentage of patients can respond to the therapy. <br />Through immunotherapy results of melanoma and lung cancer, researchers have found that response likely depends on the ability of the patient\'s own immune system to recognize the tumor as foreign. <br />\""Depending on which tumor type, it\'s somewhere between 15 to 30 percent of patients who will respond to checkpoint blockade,\"" Patel said. \""And if you do respond, usually that response is quite durable.\""<br />The goal now becomes getting a better response to immunotherapy[4]. <br />As foreign pathogens, viruses can recreate the ability to recognize a tumor by bringing immune cells into the tumor microenvironment. Researchers also know that some viruses can directly kill cancer cells and stimulate an immune reaction around the cancer cells. <br />\""When tumors die, they release antigens that can be recognized by immune cells. So it increases the chance that you have a T-cell that now recognizes the tumor,\"" Patel explained. \""Those are now tumor-specific immune responses that could potentially be long lived.\""<br />Viruses can also increase the cancer cell expression of PDL-1. <br />\""I think all of those things conspire together to show that this is probably going to be a good way to activate the immune system, making the immune cells recognize that there\'s a tumor there,\"" Patel said. \""Then, if we block PDL-1, you\'ll have a much better chance of getting an active immune response.\"" <br />Using Viruses to Fight Mesothelioma <br />The concept of virotherapy, or using viruses to attack cancer cells, is nothing new. But Patel and other researchers are focused on finding viruses that kill tumor cells as well as induce an enhanced immune response to the cancerous tissue. <br />Although the measles virus is the most studied in this area, it presents some challenges. The virus was a serious problem in America until an infant vaccine eliminated much of the concern. <br />\""Because people have antibodies against the measles virus, it\'s very difficult to get that virus to where you want it to go,\"" Patel said. <br />In their recent study, Patel and Dash evaluated other viruses and their potential as a treatment against thoracic cancers, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). <br />\""Part of the interest in that one is, unlike the measles virus, most people have never been exposed to VSV,\"" Patel said. \""It\'s mainly a virus that affects animals, specifically livestock, so that whole problem with the antibodies is not really there with VSV.\""<br />A separate study showed VSV was not only effective in killing cancer cells in mice with mesothelioma tumors, but also raised the immune response of the mice against the tumors.<br />\""The activity of it was really dependent on the immune system,\"" Patel said. \""So now you have a system in which the virus is not only directly killing the cells but also raising immune response. It is an exciting finding, particularly in today\'s oncology landscape.\"" <br />Aggressiveness of Mesothelioma Presents Challenges <br />The overarching challenge facing virotherapy and all potential mesothelioma treatments is how fast the cancer spreads.<br />Mesothelioma is often diagnosed in the later stages[5] when tumors have spread outside the point of origin and possibly to other parts of the body. <br />Currently, Patel and his colleagues are focused on intratumoral injections, which involve inoculating the tumors with the viruses directly. The potential downside of this selective approach is if the tumors are widespread. <br />\""Is there enough infection going on? Is there enough replication going on? And is there enough viroimmune response to really get at the whole body burden of cancer? I think those are some questions we\'re working on,\"" Patel said. \""If a patient has a metastatic tumor, or widely spread cancer, you may infect just some of those cancer cells. And is that going to be enough to create a whole systemic response?\""<br />Another question being addressed is how to improve the delivery of a virus to a broad variety of spots affected. <br />Patel and other investigators are looking at using cells to help carry the virus. <br />\""We know for sure that there\'s another virus called Rio Virus that gets carried along with immune cells in the bloodstream, which we don\'t seem to see with some of these other viruses but at the same time there are potentially different strategies that could be used to deliver the virus to where we want it to go,\"" Patel said. <br />Perhaps the biggest challenge facing researchers is the development process. <br />Developing new drugs is costly and time consuming. For mesothelioma, the rarity of the disease is a challenge in itself, as it is difficult to conduct a large enough clinical trial. <br />\""Anytime we make a change to the baseline virus, it has to go through the whole development pathway all over again. \""We have way more ideas than we have time to develop into a useful drug. So that\'s another major challenge - to determine which viruses to stick with because the process is lengthy.\""<br />References^ edging immunotherapy drugs closer (www.asbestos.com)^ genetically altered measles virus (www.asbestos.com)^ showed significant tumor reduction (www.asbestos.com)^ better response to immunotherapy (www.asbestos.com)^ diagnosed in the later stages (www.asbestos.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEMTuOo-HXQkvDEijcawU_wuaHAZw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=5KU3WdjrGMHwW6PahLAN&url=https://www.asbestos.com/news/2017/06/06/viruses-increase-potential-mesothelioma-immunotherapy/,EN,,07/06/2017 07:05,2017-06-06 17:11:30+00:00,6c96f54554,Asbestos.com,,,,,1496776290,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a6816e7a7c,"A wrongful hanging in Connemara, 1882 - Irish Times","A wrongful hanging in Connemara, 1882<br />The handwriting was impeccable but written in a language the correspondent did not speak. <br />\""Sir, I beg to state through the columns of your influential journal that my husband, Myles Joyce, now a convict in Galway jail, is not guilty of the crime,\"" a heavily pregnant Brighid Joyce[1] said in her appeal to the editor of the Freeman\'s Journal on December 11th, 1882. <br />\""Does not everyone easily imagine a man going before his Almighty God will tell the thruth [sic], in telling the thruth they must confess that he never shared in it,\"" she continued.<br />\""I earnestly beg and implore his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant to examine and consider this hard case of an innocent man, which leaves a widow and five orphans to be before long a dhrift [sic] in the world,\""she concluded, signing off as \""the wife of Myles Joyce that is to be executed on the 15th inst . . .\"" <br />A response to prison governor George Mason[2] from the viceroy, Lord Spencer, coldly stated that the \""Law must take its course\"". Five days later, even as Brighid had given birth to a daughter, The Irish Times was at the Galway scaffold. <br />\""At a quarter-past eight o\'clock the prison doors were thrown open,\"" the paper\'s correspondent noted in his report published on December 16th, 1882. <br />\""With startled looks they marked the wild, hollow eyes, sunken cheeks, and shrunken forms of each other, but not a word passed between them. Myles Joyce came first, between two warders, bareheaded, repeating in Irish the responses to the prayers which were being read by the Rev Mr Grevan. <br />\""Then came Pat Casey[3], pinioned, silent, and with a look of great agony on his features. Last appeared Pat Joyce[4], taller than the others, wearing his hat, silent, too, and walking with firm and steady step . . . \"" <br />Last words <br />The executioner, William Marwood[5], then placed them with the tallest man in the centre, and began pinioning the knees. Myles Joyce continued to speak in an \""excited way\"", the correspondent said. <br />\""It was impossible to gather the meaning of much that fell from him, even by Irish-speaking persons who were present; but the following sentences have been interpreted for me by one who understands and speaks the language thoroughly, and who was close enough to hear the greater part of what he said. <br />\""These sentences were: \'I am going before my God. I was not there at all. I had no hand or part in it. I am as innocent as a child in the cradle. It is a poor thing to take this life away on a stage; but I have my priest with me.\' \"" <br />Worse was to come. <br />\""Two of the ropes remained perfectly motionless, but the third, that by which Myles Joyce was hanged, could be seen by those who watched it closely to vibrate, and swing slightly backwards and forwards,\"" the report stated. <br />\""It soon became evident, from Marwood\'s behaviour, that there had been a hitch of some kind or other, and he muttered, \'bother the fellow\', sat down on the scaffold, laid hold of the rope, and moved it backwards and forwards . . . \"" <br />It may have been 134 years ago, but on the Galway-Mayo border they still remember the horrific deaths and ensuing miscarriage of justice associated with Connemara\'s Maamtrasna murders. <br />When John Joyce[6]; his wife (also called Brighid); his mother, Mairéad; his daughter Peigí; and son Micheál were killed in Maamtrasna valley, it was presumed that the motive was connected with stealing sheep. The offence was regarded as serious at a time of severe poverty and hardship in the west. <br />Only two of the family survived the attack: a nine-year-old boy, Patsy, who was badly injured, and his older brother Mairtín, who had been working as a farmhand in a neighbouring parish and was away from home that night. Eight men were convicted on the basis of what emerged later to be perjured evidence. Three of the eight were executed and five imprisoned. <br />A kind of confession <br />Two years afterwards, in August 1884, Tom Casey[7], who was one of the witnesses, walked up to the altar of the church in Tourmakeady[8] during Confirmation Mass by the archbishop of Tuam, Dr John McEvilly. Holding a lit candle, Casey declared he had caused the death of an innocent man, Myles Joyce, and the imprisonment of four others who were not guilty. There were subsequently lengthy debates in the British parliament, with Charles Stewart Parnell[9] and colleagues demanding an inquiry. There has never been an official apology. <br />The Maamtrasna saga is a mix of \""murder mystery, courtroom drama and political intrigue\"", says journalist Seán Ó Cuirreáin, who has uncovered previously unreported detail for his new book, Éagóir. For instance, Ó Cuirreáin has come across a letter from the sheriff\'s office in Galway asking the hangman, William Marwood, from Lincolnshire, if he would do a cut-price job as the executions would all take place on one day. \""I have to remark that the law does not allow the Sheriff anything for these executions and that he has to pay the entire cost out of his pocket,\"" the officer wrote to Marwood, offering him £20. <br />While perusing the British archives in Kew, Ó Cuirreáin also discovered that a move to pay the witnesses bore the personal hand of lord-lieutenant the Earl Spencer[10], great granduncle of the current princes Harry and William. Not only did he compensate three men who claimed to be eye witnesses, but he paid them well over the going rate: a sum totalling £1,250, equivalent to about ?157,000 today. <br />Ó Cuirreáin\'s account notes that the accused men\'s solicitor was a 24-year-old Trinity College graduate who didn\'t have a word of Irish. The men themselves had no idea what was going on in court due to the language barrier. The court records one of them, bewildered, asking \""Cén lá a chrocfar mé?\"" (\""What day will I be hanged?\""). <br />The five who received a reprieve languished in prison in spite of the fact that the man who had planned and directed the murders was named publicly in print and in parliament. Ó Cuirreáin publishes some of the letters dictated by the five to their spouses at home. <br />\""I am in very good health, thank God. I have every convenience,\""one of the men, John Casey[11], wrote, clearly trying to remain positive. \""It is very hard for me to have been in prison and separated from my family, especially when I am innocent,\"" he said. \""Let me know are the crops promising this year . . .\"" The first to champion their case was a journalist and MP, Tim Harrington[12], who met some of them when he was convicted for participating in anti-eviction protests. <br />\""Harrington did all the good things an investigative journalist would do, visiting the area with two priests in 1885,\"" Ó Cuirreáin says. \""He even named the instigator, who was never charged, because even back then the British government couldn\'t contemplate the \'appalling vista\' of having to admit to convicting innocent people.\"" <br />The two survivors <br />As for the two children who survived, they were sent to Artane[13] industrial school in Dublin. One of them, Mairtín, spent time in Britain and the US before returning to Dublin. Two of Mairtín Joyce\'s sons were members of the senior Dublin GAA team playing in Croke Park on Bloody Sunday in 1920, when British forces opened fire on the crowd and killed 14 civilians. <br />Ó Cuirreáin says he was attracted to the case for a number of reasons, not least the fact that it was a \""language issue\"": the men who had no English were tried and convicted in an English-speaking court. Although there have been other accounts, Éagóir is the first book published in Irish, and he undertook this \""as a mark of respect to the men and their families\"". <br />Five years ago, two members of the House of Lords, David Alton and the late Eric Lubbock, sought to have the case reviewed. Britain\'s justice minister, Crispin Blunt, conceded that Myles Joyce was \""probably an innocent man\"" but said he would not seek a posthumous pardon unless there were \""compelling new reasons or sufficient public interest\"". <br />Lord Alton[14] has close family ties with the Maamtrasna area. He says the case opened prime minister William Gladstone\'s eyes to the \""injustices in Ireland[15] and paved the way for his support for land reform, for Irish home rule and for his \'mission to pacify Ireland\'.\"" <br />Pointing to the parallels with the Birmingham Six and Guildford[16] Four, Lord Alton has said that \""the true healing of British-Irish relations requires that, wherever possible, ghosts should be laid peacefully to rest and wrongs righted.

a6932b4f6b,Deaths From Gun Violence: How The US Compares With The Rest Of The World - NPR,"Goats and Soda : NPR<br />Editor\'s note: This story was originally published in October and has been republished with updates following the shooting Wednesday in Florida. It was the deadliest school shooting since a gunman took 26 lives at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newton, Conn. On Wednesday, a shooter killed at least 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The Florida shooting is the latest reminder of the persistent gun violence in the United States. Rates of gun deaths in the U.S. are far greater than in much of the rest of the world. Take countries with the top indicators of socioeconomic success - income per person and average education level, for instance. The United States ranks ninth in the world among them, bested only by the likes of Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Iceland, Andorra, Canada and Finland. Those countries all also enjoy low rates of gun violence, but the U.S. has the 31st highest rate in the world: 3.85 deaths due to gun violence per 100,000 people in 2016. That was eight times as high as the rate in Canada, which had 0.48 deaths per 100,000 people - and 27 times higher than the one in Denmark, which had 0.14 deaths per 100,000. The numbers comes from a massive database maintained by the University of Washington\'s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation[1], which tracks lives lost in every country, in every year, by every possible cause of death. The 2016 figures, released last fall, paint a fairly rosy picture for much of the world, with deaths due to gun violence rare even in many countries that are extremely poor - such as Bangladesh and Laos, which saw 0.16 deaths and 0.13 deaths respectively per 100,000 people. <br />Prosperous Asian countries such as Singapore and Japan boast the absolute lowest rates, though the United Kingdom and Germany are in almost as good shape. \""It is a little surprising that a country like ours should have this level of gun violence,\"" says Ali Mokdad[2], a professor of global health and epidemiology at the IHME. \""If you compare us to other well-off countries, we really stand out.\"" <br />To be sure, there are quite a few countries where gun violence is a substantially larger problem than in the United States - particularly in Central America and the Caribbean. Mokdad says a major driver is the large presence of gangs and drug trafficking. \""The gangs and drug traffickers fight amongst themselves to get more territory, and they fight the police,\"" says Mokdad. And citizens who are not involved are often caught in the crossfire. <br />Mokdad said drug trafficking may also be a driving factor in two Asian countries that have unusually large rates of violent gun deaths for their region, the Philippines and Thailand. <br />With the casualties due to armed conflicts factored out, even in conflict-ridden regions such as the Middle East, the U.S. rate is worse than in all but one country: Iraq. <br />The U.S. gun violence death rate is also higher than that in nearly all countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including many that are among the world\'s poorest. <br />One more way to consider these data: The IHME also estimates what it would expect a country\'s rate of gun violence deaths to be based solely on its socioeconomic status. By that measure, the U.S. should be seeing only 0.79 deaths per 100,000 people. Instead, its actual rate of 3.85 deaths per 100,000 is almost five times as high.<br />References^ Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (www.healthdata.org)^ Ali Mokdad (globalhealth.washington.edu)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHrKWZReqczRczDh8iYmI0EXn3xwg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779801842840&ei=HeKHWonrE9bIzAa48KyoDw&url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/02/15/586014065/deaths-from-gun-violence-how-the-u-s-compares-to-the-rest-of-the-world,EN,,17/02/2018 08:02,2018-02-15 18:30:47+00:00,7903d30a98,NPR,,,,,1518723047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a6a5bb0c1e,Final Four: Billy Gillispie meets the woman who will donate a kidney and change his life - USA TODAY,"Billy Gillispie meets the woman who will donate a kidney<br />Ericka Downey meets Billy Gillispie for the first time. Downey, wife of college basketball coach Mark Downey of Northeastern State, is donating a kidney to Gillispie.(Photo: Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports)SAN ANTONIO - For more than two decades Billy Gillispie has been coming to the Final Four, whether it be in search of jobs, connections or glory. But this year, the longtime college basketball coach came mostly to meet a woman who on Friday night wore a red dress and a radiant smile.Standing near the center of the room at a private party she was hosting, the woman called over her two young sons to meet Gillispie.\""He\'s the guy I\'m giving my kidney to,\"" she saidWhile the men\'s basketball teams from Loyola-Chicago, Michigan, Kansas and Villanova went through final preparations for their games Saturday at the Alamodome, a quiet moment was unfolding nearby. Gillispie and Ericka Downey, a 33-year-old mother and wife of a Division II college basketball coach, were meeting for the first time before kidney transplant surgery, tentatively set for April 24 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.In December, Gillispie, 58, was diagnosed with kidney failure. Within six months, his doctor told him, he would need to begin dialysis - unless he had kidney a transplant. Gillispie later learned there were more than 100,000 people waiting for a healthy kidneys, and about 4,000 people a year who don\'t get them soon enough die.But there was no such conversation on Friday night in front of Downey\'s sons, 12-year-old Drew and 6-year-old Bryce.\""Do you play basketball?\"" Gillispie asked.The son of a Texas cattle truck driver in and a self-described workaholic, Gillispie ascended the coaching ranks and led teams at Texas El-Paso and Texas A&M to the NCAA tournament three times in his first five years as a college head coach. And in 2007, after guiding Texas A&M to the Sweet 16 in for the first time In 27 years, it was off to Kentucky, where Gillispie took over one of the most hallowed programs in college basketball.But he was fired after two seasons in 2009 and arrested later that year on charges of drunken driving. In 2012 he was accused of overpracticing and mistreating players at Texas Tech.Citing health concerns, he left Texas Tech after one season.Gillispie ended up at Ranger College, a community college about 90 miles west of Fort Worth, where he was in his third season when he checked into the emergency room on Thanksgiving with a persistent cough and bad headaches. He said he thought a steroid shot would solve the problem before a battery of tests a nearby hospital.\""When the hospital personnel come in and they start saying, \'Do you have a will\' and \'What is your religious preference,\' that gets your attention in a big hurry,\"" Gillispie said. \""I said, \'Do what?\' They said we\'re not concerned it\'ll go down that fast, but this is serious. You\'ve got a serious condition here.\""Less than four months later, here he was meeting Ericka Downey.\""And you\'re getting my left kidney,\"" she told Gillispie as the room begin to fill up with college coaches. \""Left is my best side.\""The two eventually drifted into different parts of the room and Gillispie reflected on all that has transpired over the past four months. \""I don\'t know why and what would prompt anyone to do that other than that it\'s God\'s grace,\"" he said. ***On Dec. 16, a Saturday, Ericka Downey was home in Tahlequah, Okla. Her husband is head coach at Northeastern State, a Division II college, and Ericka Downey was cleaning a cluttered bedroom closet when she decided to take a break and picked up her phone. That\'s when she read story in the Dallas Morning News. Gillispie has been told he needs a kidney transplant \""ASAP,\"" the newspaper reported. \""I was aware of who he was, but I\'d never seen him coach, never seen a game with him on the sideline,\"" she said. Ericka Downey and son Bryce meet Billy Gillispie for the first time. (Photo: Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports)But Ericka Downey said she felt a calling to help, and she did her best to circulate the story on social media before she became part of it. With no potential donor candidates emerging, Downey talked to her husband about exploring where she could be the donor. \""He told me I was crazy, which we knew,\"" she said. \""And we laughed about it. But I really felt like it was initiated in faith. That was the initial pull.\""So I was like, \'All right, I think this is how it\'s going to go. If it\'s not God, if he\'s not involved in this, then I won\'t be a match and we\'ll continue to advocate for coach Gillispie. But we\'ll know that it\'s not meant to be, that I\'m not supposed to be the donor. And as my husband says so often, everything just kept coming back positive and positive and positive.\"" Then in January, Ericka Downey got a message on Twitter from Josh Mills, one of Gillispie\'s former assistants. Mills told her she had seen the efforts she was making on social media to help find Gillispie a kidney donor. \""I\'ve shared with coach what you\'re doing and he wants to say thank you,\"" she recalled Mills writing. \""Here\'s his cell (number). Will you reach out to him?\""She called, but there was no answer. So then she texted, and Gillispie texted back. \""He was so thankful,\"" she said. \""But he didn\'t know I was a donor at that point.\"" In mid-February, Ericka Downey heard from the Mayo Clinic and texted Gillispie again. \""We match,\"" she wrote, adding that she would be going to the Mayo Clinic, where Gillispie had extensive medical tests, to undergo a battery of tests that would determine if they were compatible for the surgery. \""Oh, wow,\"" she said Gillispie replied. \""I would love to arrange transportation and lodging for you. Just a small gesture, not nearly as nice as your life-changing gesture. \""I\'m not asking. I\'m demanding. I\'m still the coach.\"" Ericka Downey politely declined, and her husband could have warned Gillispie as much about his independent wife. ***Mark Downey still is concerned.. He explained that his father had died of kidney failure in 2009 - the year he and Ericka married - and wondered who else might need the kidney that will go to Gillispie. \""What if down the line I need one?\"" Mark Downey said. \""What if our kids needed it? Whatever it may be. Somebody else in the family. What if, what if, what if?\""Even though Ericka Downey said the medical tests show she is in excellent health, Mark Downey said he\'s nervous about the surgery based on first-hand experience. In August 2016, he said, underwent knee surgery and suffered a bilateral pulmonary embolism, with blood clots entering each of his lungs.He was in danger of a suffering a stroke and spent a week in the hospital before being discharged.Ericka Downey, who is a medical device representative for Abbott Laboratories, said, \""It was very serious.\"" But her face brightened as she pointed out she\'s younger and healthier than her 45-year-old husband.\""I\'m still a young chicken,\"" she said.Ericka Downey and Mark Downey with sons Drew, 6, Bryce, 12. . (Photo: Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports)Mark Downey grinned. Over the 12 years they\'ve known each other, he said, he\'s learned he can\'t change her mind - especially about something like this.\""She\'s never wavered,\"" he said. \""She\'s never flinched. When I go to the refrigerator, I second-guess myself. She hasn\'t second-guessed herself once. She hasn\'t come to me one time and said, \'I\'m scared\' or \'I\'m not sure I want to do this.\' Not once.\""It was something at Gillispie has marveled.On March 8, Mark Downey and Gillispie crossed paths at a junior college basketball tournament. They\'ve known each other for years.In 1998, Downey was an assistant Independence (Kan.) Community College when Gillispie was an assistant under Bill Self at Tulsa and recruiting one of Independence\'s players. David Shelton ended up signing with Tulsa and averaged double figures in scoring during his two seasons at Tulsa.\""He\'s always been really good to me,\"" Downey saidSo Gillispie and Downey sat next to each other that junior college tournament earlier this month and watched at least an entire half of a game and talked only of basketball, recalled Mark Downey recalled, until Gillispie got up to leave.\""I can\'t believe what your wife is doing,\"" Mark Downey recalled Gillispie saying and tearing up.Friday night, at the party Ericka Downey annually hosts for up to 50 coaches - those she and her husband have worked with and gotten to know over the years - a man in a dark blue suit and a red-and-blue blended tie looked a little unsure of himself as he stepped into the room.The coach and the donor were about to meet.***Mark Downey guided Gillispie to Ericka Downey, who stood near the center of a private room filling up with coaches. Last year, she said, she smoked cigars with legendary coach Bob Huggins, and so she looked right at home. But time froze for a moment when she was introduced to Gillispie.The two embraced.\""I\'m going to start crying,\"" Gillispie said.But there were no tears during an animated conversation as the two chatted in person for the first time. And after Gillispie met with Ericka Downey\'s boys, Gillispie moved to a corner of the room and reflected on what has transpired.He said his kidney failure resulted from high blood pressure.\""I never felt bad, so I wasn\'t very good about taking medicine for it,\"" Gillispie said. \""That\'s what they told me, eventually that this high blood pressure over a number of years, that\'s what got me.\""Initially, Gillispie added, he was unsure he could go forward with the transplant surgery.\""I\'ve never really depended on anyone for anything,\"" he said. \""I hadn\'t been married since 1993, so I\'ve been by myself. I never would ask anyone for any help, so my initial reaction was I don\'t know if I want to affect someone\'s life.\""But there are so many donors that live 100 percent normal lives, so I got a little more education (and) so I felt better about it.\""Most people who have kidney transplants, rather than undergoing dialysis as the first treatment, live longer said Dr. Joseph Vassalotti, Chief Medical Officer at the National Kidney Foundation.\""They tend to have a better quality of life and better outcomes than people who start with dialysis,\"" Vassalotti said.Told he will be \""back to normal\"" within six weeks of surgery, Gillispie said he plans to resume coaching and that he\'s perfectly happy at Ranger College, where he played from 1978 to 1980.Calling himself \""the luckiest guy on the earth,\"" Gillispie said, \""I\'m a guy from a town of 495 people and I\'m very proud to be from there (Gradford, Texas). I went from being a high school coach to the head coach at Kentucky in 15 years. ...\""It\'s just been great, and It\'s no different for me now. It\'s just a different venue. But I promise, I\'m telling the truth, I love coaching at Ranger College just as much as I loved it at Kentucky and Texas A&M.\""And after meeting Ericka Downey, Gillispie noted a parallel from his personal life intersecting with his kidney donor an a coaching career that spans more than three decades.\""I\'ve always had teams that really were sacrificing for each other,\"" he said as Ericka Downey circulated at the party. \""And she\'s making the ultimate sacrifice.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEn0du9ob9Jr1vGjlcFFwbW5vftMQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779851310543&ei=dYTAWuDZK4HyWajjoLAN&url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/03/31/final-four-billy-gillispie-meets-woman-who-donate-kidney-and-change-his-life/475971002/,EN,,01/04/2018 07:01,2018-03-31 20:52:57+00:00,51fe179e08,USA TODAY,,,,,1522536777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a6ac66eba3,Managing grass quality is the big challenge in a time of rapid growth - Irish Independent,"Managing grass quality is the big challenge in a time of rapid growth<br />Garda Tom Brosnan, PSV Inpector, Bandon addresses farmers on new standards and road rules for agricultural vehicles at the Dairygold/Teagasc Dairy Development Programme Health & Safety Event on the farm of Dan O\'Donovan, Coolmakee, Farnanes, Co Cork. Photo: O\'Gorman Photography.<br />It\'s exactly six months to the day since I wrote my last farming piece.<br />As you can imagine, over those six months a lot has happened. On Friday, March 18 my father passed away at the age of 84. For the previous 14 weeks he was a patient in the Mater Hospital following heart surgery. Things didn\'t quite work out after the operation.<br />The last six months have been a great learning experience for me and my family.Over that time jobs had to be put on hold, milking times had to be flexible, other people helped at the farmwork and did it just as well as I would. The support of the community was tremendous in time of need.<br />The beautiful weather of the past few weeks did lift the minds and spirits of everyone. The work of farming becomes pleasant again rather than a chore.Silage making is in full swing with my own silage cut last Tuesday. Given the late spring, I was wondering would there be any May silage at all. None of the silage ground was grazed this year. It got 3000 gallons of slurry on March 22 followed with 70 units of N on April 19. This was a later than normal fertiliser sowing for me because of weather conditions at the time. All the nitrogen was gone out of the grass by May 25 as it was tested. Wilting conditions were very good which should give me some quality silage next winter.<br />Managing grass quality is a huge challenge at the minute. Paddocks are growing rapidly everyday. The first three weeks of May saw great grass quality and fairly good grazing conditions.But two weeks ago I took out one paddock for round baling and it was no sooner baled til there was another one for taking out. It went into the silage pit last week.<br />The grass wedge last week was telling me on a stocking rate of 4.7 LU/ha I had a cover/LU of 160. I must try to maintain this as I would expect a slowing up of grass growth now.I am spreading 30 units of CAN+S after every grazing. This is my first time to use CAN+S. Sulphur seems to be an important nutrient now for growing grass. I will probably spread each paddock twice with sulphur. No topping has been done yet. Weather has also been ideal for spraying docks and weeds.<br />So any chance I get I am spraying with Doxstar and High Load Mircam. I completed the necessary spraying course in March so all is above board.Presently the 74 cows are producing 27 litres at 3.66pc fat, 3.30pc protein giving 1.91kg MS/cow/day, with TBC of 5000.<br />I have a higher percentage of first calvers in the herd this year and so I would see my yield down a bit. I had a good spring as regards calvings. The calving jack wasn\'t used at all and no scour problems with calves.Recently I had one calf with bad pneumonia but this cleared up with treatment. As a precaution I injected all calves with Alamycin LA as a few coughs could be heard.<br />Milk feverOne batch of calves are on grass from the middle of May. I had four sets of twins this year. So far this year I lost five calves. Two with defects and a couple not watched well enough.<br />No cows were lost this spring although one or two came close with a displaced stomach and a milk fever case. A couple of cows had to be treated for heart infections and I am hoping they have sorted themselves out.The breeding season is well underway now and AI began on April 8. The team of bulls I am using this year are YBG, FR2050, FR2275, YRY, FR2314, LWR. They have a combined EBI of 332 and 39kgs of fat and protein. A batch of 28 heifers were served with AI before they went to grass and they are now divided into two batches with a bull. Cows are showing strong heats. I had a very active teaser bull complete with chinball with the cows.I let in a Friesian bull with the cows on May 27 and he will be changed to the Hereford bull on June 17.<br />There are two cows on a CIDR programme and I will scan the cows next week. I have been washing out the cows that had twins and a few others that I saw discharging.In the last few months I had my second Bord Bia inspection which went off very well. After a full three hours I was happy with my final score and the few small recommendations made will be taken on board.I had another student for 12 weeks from Ballyhaise. He was a keen dairy student who was a big help during a difficult spring.<br />In early April RTE\'s \'Big Week on the Farm\' came and filmed. It was a great breath of fresh air for us to host the programme. The same month, I also hosted our discussion group.One area we looked at was the future and how to further develop the farm. Going forward, milk price will be critical in decision making.Gerard Sherlock farms at Tydavnet, Co Monaghan<br />Indo Farming",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH9VZUn2OCcQqzI2jNgRkgPlpmbLA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=dsRXV_iwNteQzAbjpaWACQ&url=http://www.independent.ie/business/farming/managing-grass-quality-is-the-big-challenge-in-a-time-of-rapid-growth-34776409.html,EN,,08/06/2016 07:15,2016-06-07 23:32:03+00:00,e0a6a790e1,Irish Independent,,,,,1465349523,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
da4924c16b,Climate Change\'s Effects on Food Production Are More Harmful and Deadly Than We Thought - Mic,"Climate Change\'s Effects on Food Production Are More Harmful and Deadly Than We Thought<br />If you\'ve ever needed a statistic to slap you in the face to make you give a damn about climate change, this is it: A new report[1] from the Lancet estimates more than 500,000 adults could die in 2050, thanks to how climate change will kill crop productivity, altering diets and available food all over the world.<br />\""Changes in food availability and intake also affect dietary and weight-related risk factors such as low fruit and vegetable intake, high red meat consumption and high body weight,\"" Dr. Marco Springmann[2], a post-doctoral researcher from the University of Oxford and leader of the study, said in a statement[3]. \""These all increase the incidence of non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer, as well as death from those diseases.\""<br />According to Springmann\'s model, the global reduction in fruit and vegetable availability could lead to 534,000[4] climate-related deaths across 155 countries[5] - hardly stifled by the 29,000 deaths prevented because of people eating less red meat (but only because the cows are dead).<br />Source: Getty Images[6]There\'s some good news, kind of. According to the authors, the lower calorie availability will probably save 260,000 people[7] who would otherwise die from obesity. But, considering how many people in the world struggle to find food at all, that lower caloric intake will in turn cause 266,000 deaths[8] from malnourishment.<br />Springmann advocated heavily for emission reductions and public health programs, saying, depending on the strength of the program, it could reduce climate-related deaths by up to 71%. Unfortunately, that\'s only in the near future.<br />According to[9] Dr. Alistair Woodward from the University of Auckland in New Zealand and Professor John Porter from the University of Copenhagen, the report might help figure out our next 30 or 40 years, but it can\'t predict huge potential problems after that. There needs to be more focus on mitigating problems immediately, they said.<br />\""Springmann and colleagues have moved the climate and food debate in a necessary direction by highlighting both food and nutritional security, but a mountain of policy-relevant questions remain that require close scrutiny,\"" Woodward and Porter wrote in a statement[10].<br />The point of the study should be clear: Despite the people who won\'t die from obesity (a really small number in the grand scheme of global nutritional security), a lot of people are going to die because they can\'t eat. If it\'s studies like this one that will make people realize how much their lives actually depend on the foods grown in and on the ground, we\'re bound to see more panicked reports. And that\'s a good thing.References^ new report (www.eurekalert.org)^ Dr. Marco Springmann (www.futureoffood.ox.ac.uk)^ statement (www.eurekalert.org)^ 534,000 (www.eurekalert.org)^ 155 countries (press.thelancet.com)^ Getty Images (www.gettyimages.com)^ 260,000 people (www.eurekalert.org)^ 266,000 deaths (www.eurekalert.org)^ According to (www.eurekalert.org)^ statement (www.eurekalert.org)<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEtAGi8BbZe-bAIhACUodxsEg2Ecw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779056469736&ei=lJLaVuDQLovKau-8qYgI&url=http://mic.com/articles/136946/climate-change-s-effects-on-food-production-are-more-harmful-and-deadly-than-we-thought,EN,,05/03/2016 08:02,2016-03-03 16:17:00+00:00,32e31fcbad,Mic,,,,,1457025420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2519570cb2,Women need to stop saying this - NEWS.com.au,"Women need to stop saying this<br />Jennifer Lawrence Visits \""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\""<br />A FEW weeks ago, I was walking the dog near my family\'s country property. The house is on an old bush track and, as usual, Belle was off the lead. <br />I had taken a phone call from Mum when I noticed it: my dog had dashed through the open gate of a neighbour, lured in to play by the family\'s two convivial chocolate labs.<br />No matter, I thought, and turned to retrieve my dog. It was then that I heard the screaming. Startled, I hurtled toward the property to witness a woman flailing at Belle with a broomstick while making the most piercing, guttural noises.<br />Belle came tearing out, tail between her legs, and proceeded to cower behind me.<br />The woman, headed back toward the house, looked at me from afar. \""If I ever see that dog in here again,\"" she fumed, \""I\'m going to fricking shoot it dead!\""<br />My guts cramped up, heart began hammering. But what did I say? \""Sorry,\"" in the most meek, mild voice. In that instant, I hated myself.<br />You see, I was not the one who should have been sorry. Apparently unbeknown to this woman, her two labs had been routinely jumping the fence to our property to play with Belle. The area is cattle and sheep heartland, so dogs shouldn\'t really be wandering around unsupervised, but we had thought it none of our business to intervene. We had been trying to be neighbourly.<br />The injustice was paralysing. I paced along, pulse racing, growing more indignant with every step. How dare she threaten me! My own pathetic response reverberated through my brain on repeat: Sorry, sorry, sorry. But I wasn\'t sorry! I had to go back.<br />I turned around. Then again. And once more. \""Just do it!\"" I scolded the child inside me, the kid so petrified of upsetting anyone. \""She deserves it!\""<br />Distracted by my inner battle, I didn\'t notice the car until she was there, speaking to me. \""Sorry,\"" she offered, \""I shouldn\'t have...\""<br />\""Did you know,\"" I exploded, shocked to hear my own voice, \""that your dogs wander around other people\'s properties unsupervised, and chase the cattle?\""<br />She drew breath, tightened her jaw. I couldn\'t stop. \""How can you expect my dog to stay off your land when you leave your gate wide open; when your labs come out to solicit every dog that walks past? How is it that YOUR dogs are allowed to come onto MY land every day, but my dog makes one mistake and you threaten to frigging SHOOT HER?\""<br />Now she was angry. \""My dogs don\'t do that! They...\""<br />\""I have photos, lady!\"" I had lost it. \""You are the biggest hypocrite I\'ve ever met! Shut your stupid gate, and if I ever see your dogs chasing cattle again, I\'ll call the bloody pound!\""<br />And with that, I stormed off. I had done it: said everything I\'d wanted to say. But I didn\'t feel triumphant. I felt guilty.<br />***<br />Like most women, I will go to great lengths to avoid stepping on any toes. Research shows women tend to pepper their speech[1] with superfluous \""sorrys\"", put others\' needs ahead of their own at work, and habitually submit to being spoken over in the boardroom.<br />The problem? We\'re so used to being polite, many of us have no idea how to assert ourselves when we need to. Instead, we engage in passive aggressive behaviours, snipe behind others\' backs, or, as the Labrador owner can attest to, bottle things up till we simply explode. <br />Unfortunately, these responses tend to exacerbate, rather than soothe, a tense situation.<br />So why are we so uncomfortable with assertiveness?<br />According to psychologist Sandra Thomas[2], PhD, a leading researcher on women\'s anger, our fear of engaging in conflict harks back to our childhoods. \""For girls, acting out is not encouraged. They tend to get the message that anger is unpleasant or unfeminine.\"" <br />Unlike boys, who are encouraged to externalise their anger, women learn that it\'s better to bottle up their own feelings than risk upsetting anyone else\'s.<br />We all know what it feels like to stand, dumbstruck, while someone unloads on us, only to spend the next five hours going over what we should have said. But the ramifications of wimpiness go beyond temporary frustration. Thomas explains that in women, stifled anger leads to especially high levels of resentment.<br />And resentment is poison to relationships. Psychologist Terry Gaspard outlines how bottling up anger[3] in a partnership leads to \""less warmth, affection and over time less fondness and admiration for your partner\"".<br />At work, resentment can lead to feelings of powerlessness. Even superstars aren\'t immune: In her 2015 essay for Lenny[4], Jennifer Lawrence admitted to feeling \""like a failure\"" after she withdrew early from pay negotiations for American Hustle, fearing that sticking up for herself would cause her to appear \""spoiled\"".<br />Worse still, chronic resentment can manifest itself as mental illness. In an article for Psychology Today[5], Stephen A. Diamond Ph. D states that: \""Bitterness, which I define as a chronic and pervasive state of smouldering resentment, is one of the most destructive and toxic of human emotions.\""<br />By contrast, explains Thomas, when we are \""clear and forthright with (our) anger, and employ problem solving techniques\"", the air is cleared, respect is created, and ongoing resentment is avoided.<br />Sounds great in theory, but how do we get the guts up to put it into practice?<br />As J Law suggests, we may need to start by confronting the unconscious belief that assertiveness is somehow unladylike. We could do this by regularly affirming to ourselves that we have the right to be heard and respected. Of course, it won\'t sink in overnight, but research shows[6] that simply repeating a phrase to ourselves daily can help undo stubborn childhood conditioning to the contrary.<br />From there, it\'s down to practice. We could start small; perhaps by making the effort to express a minor irritation to a friend; and build up to the boss over time.<br />In our desperation to be nice, we women too often sacrifice our own mental wellbeing. Perhaps it\'s time we decided that it\'s not impolite to assert ourselves, especially when we are sticking up for our precious fur babies!<br />References^ pepper their speech (jezebel.com)^ psychologist Sandra Thomas (www.apa.org)^ outlines how bottling up anger (www.huffingtonpost.com)^ 2015 essay for Lenny (www.lennyletter.com)^ article for Psychology Today (www.psychologytoday.com)^ research shows (www.psychologytoday.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNESFrLz65d8rQ3lwrY4ewlSJ-jQLg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779126500728&ei=bc1TV-jOEqKNzAb5jaDoCw&url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/mind/the-thing-women-find-hardest-sticking-up-for-ourselves/news-story/e3d229988ebd793c50100f8b74008696,EN,,05/06/2016 07:04,2016-06-04 02:20:04+00:00,51fe179e08,NEWS.com.au,,,,,1465014004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
251ae1726d,The Link To The Past comic has the ending the game deserved - A.V. Club,"The Link To The Past comic has the ending the game deserved · For Our Consideration · The A.V. Club<br />Endings are inherently difficult. We don\'t want to walk away because doubt is overwhelming. Believing, hoping that we\'ll catch up later or that everything\'s going to be okay is not enough. In all likelihood, when it\'s over, we\'re never going to see each other again. We\'ll never come back. If we do, it won\'t be the same. Hence why ending a story is doubly difficult; if characters are sufficiently burning with life and pathos, capping our view into their lives is almost impossible. It\'s got to satisfyingly put an end to the trials we followed them through and also assure us that the life around them will persist. Great endings thrive on the same quality as the middle of a story: the sense that the unseen world is functioning.The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past\'s ending hangs off the game itself like gorgeous, ill-fitting shoes. It strides out from the game\'s final fight with pomp and purpose, but it\'s devoid of the life filling up the game preceding it. Despite the aching ballad that tracks its credits-one of the best songs in video game history[1], capable of ripping your heart out with Samuel Barber-ian precision-A Link To The Past discredits the humanity of Link\'s journey by halting full-stop with a happy, sunshine-filled conclusion. \""At least no one important got hurt!\"" says a Link To The Past, horns blaring after you knife Ganon in his skull-belted beer belly. However, Shotaro Ishinomori\'s comic book adaptation of A Link To The Past has the ending the game is missing, the fitting final note that ends Link\'s adventure while giving us a glimpse of a world that moves on.Here\'s the thing about Hyrule in A Link To The Past, no matter what version it\'s in: It\'s only as doomed and hopeless as the real world. A sinister, king-deposing wizard in a green muumuu may be going around the countryside kidnapping people so he can free an ancient warlord from a mystical parallel dimension, but the sun still rises. Every day you run around its hills, collecting ancient artifacts and evil-demolishing swords, the sky in Hyrule is cloud free. Animals frolic, the people of Kakariko village serve drinks at the bar and sell fish in the town square, and lumberjacks in the grove beneath Death Mountain fell trees to build new homes. Did your uncle die trying to save Princess Zelda from the wizard Agahnim? Is Kakriko\'s elder in hiding? Are folks like the poor flute player trapped and disfigured in the Dark World that Agahnim is trying to crack open for Ganon? Sure they are. But like anywhere people call home, life goes on even as it teeters on the brink of complete, violent collapse.Ishinomori\'s version of Hyrule is largely the same. Link\'s journey-first to find the Master Sword and stop Agahnim, and later to save Zelda, defeat Ganon, and free the Dark World from bondage-is truncated on the page but peppered with similar glimpses into every day life. Link doesn\'t meet a sick kid who wishes he could just go outside and catch bugs like he does in the game, but he does meet a farmer willing to hide him in a cart while he\'s on the lamb from Agahnim\'s goons. There\'s no kindly old man to give Link a mirror that doubles as an escape route from the Dark World, but there is a wacky inventor happy to make him wings to fly into the desert and a hot air balloon to storm Hyrule castle.As in the game, Link also shares a connection with Zelda, both psychic and physical. Rough as things get, they always find each other, and their relationship gives the story a soulful layer (one that\'s totally absent from their relationship in subsequent games). In the game, Zelda guides Link through his first fights. In the book, she strikes the final blow against Ganon. Life\'s significant moments in Hyrule are shared.Extra characters, like Link\'s rival Roam, don\'t necessarily make the comic version of Hyrule more multifaceted than the one in the game so much as they reinforce how alive it was in the first place. Every chance meeting or change in the action in Ishinomori\'s work on the page feels like something that could have happened on the cartridge when you shut it down. Nintendo painted the countryside in spare but precise strokes to make the place feel like life is chugging where you can\'t see it. It makes the game\'s perfunctory happy ending feel all the more thin when you reach it. The Triforce, the omnipotent god-treasure Ganon imprisoned in the Dark World, invites Link to make a wish after you finally put the kibosh on the evil pig monster. After raising it into the air, the screen fades to white and a montage so sweet it could cause diabetes starts. The King returns to health! The elder\'s back in town. All the fire-breathing Zora dudes are partying in the waterfall. Link\'s uncle isn\'t dead at all; he\'s right here. The Dark World reverts to its innocent state as the Golden Land, and the Master Sword \""sleeps again... FOREVER!\"" Good. Great. Grand. Let\'s all have punch and pie and take a nap forever.Ishinomori\'s Link To The Past, meanwhile, briefly echoes the game\'s ending before changing it in vital ways. In seizing the Triforce, the Dark World recedes and peace is restored. We don\'t see that peace in the shape of a world tour where everyone\'s happy, but it\'s represented in more solemn ritual. Link and Zelda find themselves back in Hyrule, and the spirits of Link\'s uncle and as his long lost parents appear to praise his \""lonely and difficult victory\"" and remind him to never forget the people who paved the way for him. \""Let the memories of their efforts humble you. Never forget!\"" they say before Zelda is crowned queen in the absence of her departed father, Link is made master of her knights, and a \""longed-for peace\"" returns to the kingdom.The final scene finds Zelda seeking out Link when he\'s finally returning the Master Sword to the Lost Woods. She laments how now that their struggle is over, now that they\'re both free to live, their connection has faded. Link has grown distant as he protects the Triforce and Zelda, like all rulers, is isolated. \""As long as I live, I shall never forget the time when we were together in our dreams,\"" she says as she rides off, leaving behind the Master Sword to rest for centuries, \""waiting to call a hero to arms.\""Link To The Past doesn\'t end better under Ishinomori\'s hand because it\'s a bummer. The juvenile belief that life is, as Kevin Smith famously wrote on behalf of all juveniles in Clerks, a series of down endings is idiotically shortsighted. Life\'s a series of down endings and up endings and weird endings and inexplicable endings-life\'s more than one thing, and it goes on. The Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past deserves Ishinomori\'s ending because even while it\'s a bummer, Hyrule doesn\'t just stop because you stabbed Pig Satan and picked up a couple of triangles. The dead stay dead and the living change and shift and move. Zelda and Link shared something powerful. It transformed them, and while they can mourn what\'s past, that doesn\'t negate the very real, good things they earned in the process. And the Master Sword is waiting because things will inevitably start falling apart again. Someone will need to fight a pig monster or there will be a plague or Death Mountain will erupt. Something will happen in Hyrule after Ishinomori\'s ending, for better or ill. That\'s the best type of ending, the one that recognizes that it\'s always, in some way, the end of the world, and life wouldn\'t be worth living otherwise. <br />References^ songs in video game history (www.youtube.com)<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEHSihlvDG8hyLoXae294kU75t0uw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=RdvCVqjXJNvba9iJgugI&url=http://www.avclub.com/article/link-past-comic-has-ending-game-deserved-231768,EN,,16/02/2016 08:18,2016-02-16 05:16:56+00:00,c1967ab863,A.V.

da66d9fcd6,Equine cuisine around the world - EQUUS Magazine,"Equine cuisine around the world<br />A look at what goes into hay nets and feed tubs in far-off lands may give you a new appreciation for the options you have for mealtime at your own barn.The first time I ever fed a horse I was in Heidelberg, Germany. I was 9 and my father, a career soldier, was stationed there. I don\'t remember if my mom had found horseback riding listed in the catalog of recreation options for dependent youth or if I discovered it on my own, but I was signed up, and every Saturday morning my parents drove our giant American station wagon through narrow streets to a local farm. There, an instructor named Frau Beier taught me the basics of horsemanship. Riding wasn\'t enough to satisfy me, though. Within a few weeks, I\'d cajoled my way into staying after lessons to help groom horses and do basic barn chores, including feeding.I remember the first time I lifted the heavy lid on the feed bin and peered inside. One section was filled to the brim with raw, golden oats. I didn\'t know at the time that they\'d gone through a roller, which slightly cracked their outer shells for better digestibility. But I did quickly learn that if I popped a few in my mouth, I could work them like sunflower seeds between my teeth to grind out the interior goodness---and then I\'d spit out the husks behind the row of stalls when no one was looking. The other section of the feed bin was filled with a mixture of oats, corn and other grains covered in a coat of molasses that smelled like heaven. This mixture, I was told, was made right on the farm and given only to a few select horses. I figured they were the luckiest horses, but in retrospect I realize they were probably the older school horses who had trouble holding their weight. I didn\'t encounter pelleted, commercially produced horse feed until a year later, when my dad was transferred to the East Coast of the United States. One afternoon each week during summer camp, we\'d watch the feed store deliver the bags with a familiar corporate logo on the side. Pellets, I discovered, weren\'t as fun to chew on as raw oats. That was the same summer I learned to stack hay. Lots and lots and lots of hay. A few years later, the military sent my family to The Netherlands. There, I helped fling literal shovelfuls of giant, misshapen carrots, aesthetically unfit for the local market, over stall doors. The horses, whose turnout was limited because the low-lying fields were small and nearly always wet, spent their evenings busily rooting through straw in oversized box stalls to find the carrots. It was an effective way to provide the mental stimulation of grazing when pastures weren\'t available. After finishing high school, I spent time as a working student at an eventing yard in southeast England. Among my duties was helping feed about 45 horses every morning and evening. This was my first experience with chopped forage---hay cut into tiny pieces and delivered to the farm in large paper bags. Chopped forage, I was told by a fellow working student who took pity on the confused young Yankee, made up for the inability to consistently secure good quality hay on the cloudy, rainy island. I also learned---without anyone\'s help---that the flaked barley, made at a farm down the road and fed to the horses who were too \""hot\"" on oats, was delightful to chew on as I delivered the horses their meals. The last three decades of my horsekeeping experience have been in the United States. In that time, I\'ve taught at, helped manage, farm-sat or just pitched in at dozens of barns, feeding hundreds of horses. An American feed room is as familiar and comforting to me as anywhere on the planet. I do, however, occasionally wonder what people on the other side of the globe are feeding these days. I know time has brought some changes since my international adventures in horsekeeping, and globalization has unquestionably made the world a smaller, more homogenous place. But local geography, resources and customs must certainly have preserved some of the feeding practices and quirks specific to different countries and regions.I\'m lucky to be in a position to find out. I recently emailed researchers, veterinarians and horse owners around the globe who have helped with EQUUS stories and asked them to describe the feeding practices in their home country. Like most horsepeople around the world, they were happy to share their experiences. And, as I expected, modern feed rooms in various countries have much in common. Nonetheless, there are some fascinating differences. Here\'s a brief look at what some horses around the world are eating these days.New Zealand: Where grazing comes first Grass in New Zealand is lush and abundant, supporting the dairy cows and sheep that form the cornerstones of the economy. Likewise, fresh grass supplies the bulk of the nutrition for horses living in the island nation. \""The temperate climate of New Zealand permits horses to be kept at pasture all year round,\"" says Chris Riley, BVSc, PhD, at Massey University. \""Even in riding stables, horses get regular turnout onto pasture every day.\"" Riley adds that those pastures are developed and maintained with equine nutrition in mind. All that grass means that supplementation with hay or grain isn\'t common, especially among pleasure horses who have lower energy needs, explains Riley. \""Sport horses are generally managed at pasture but may have up to half of their digestible energy requirements (60 of 116 MJ/day) provided as concentrate and supplementary hay. Leisure/pleasure horses and pony club ponies are usually kept at pasture for the whole time. Although broodmares may be supplemented with hay during the winter months, most pleasure horses are not.\"" Of course, too much grass can be a bad thing. \""Sometimes during the year there may be some restriction of access to pasture for heavier horses or ponies due to the risk of over ingestion and laminitis,\"" says Riley. As for concentrates, Riley says the few owners who feed them typically opt for premixed commercial feeds formulated for the horse\'s stage of life or activity, rather than straight grains. \""There is a moderate degree of choice among premixed commercial feeds, but nowhere near the level of choice available in North America.\"" South Africa: Coping with droughtHorses in South Africa live very different lives than those in the Northern Hemisphere. Yet some experiences are universal.\""Feeds are typically premixed,\"" says Sophie Baker, a horse owner in Gauteng. \""Very few owners in South Africa mix their own feeds, although some may add oats, barley or beet pulp to an existing premade food. Amounts fed will depend on the breed, as our hardy native breeds get far less than Thoroughbreds, which are probably the most common breed of pleasure horse found in South Africa.\""The African continent has grass species that may be unfamiliar to horsekeepers in other parts of the world. \""Generally, we feed eragrostis or teff,\"" says Baker, referring to two common types of local grasses that are used to make hay. \""Alfalfa is called lucerne and is sometimes fed for extra weight or \'oomph\' but in very small amounts added to normal grass hay.\""More familiar to American horsekeepers may be the struggles South Africans can have finding hay during prolonged dry spells. \""With the recent drought, grass supplies were very low, so a lot of people have also recently turned to oat hay. Before the drought, grass was readily and easily available at good prices, but the drought has caused major supply issues and pushed prices up significantly---though we do expect this to normalize in time.\""Finally, some feeding practices in South Africa have no counterpart in the United States. \""A lot of people here feed rooibos tea to their horses, particularly for those with sweet itch or other skin conditions,\"" says Baker. \""Normally this is dried tea leaves as it\'s more cost effective, but it isn\'t unheard of for people to use brewed tea either.\"" Sweden: Wrapping up foragesWith long winters bringing average temperatures between -7 and 26 degrees Fahrenheit, many of the feeding challenges Swedish horse owners face are cold weather related. \""Pasture season is short compared to many other countries,\"" says Cecilia Müller, PhD, an associate professor of equine feed science at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Grazing in the south of the country is typically available from the beginning of May to the end of September, while in the north, it\'s only from June to the end of August. \""This has to be overcome by harvesting summer grass for winter feeding. Winters in the south are commonly damp and not so cold (coastal climate), while up north they are dry and can be very cold (inland climate). Damp winters mean storage of hay is very difficult as the damp air moistens the hay and results in mold growth.\""One solution to this challenge is wrapping harvested grasses in plastic for protection from the elements: Silage is wrapped forage with less than 50 percent dry matter content, while haylage is wrapped forage with more than 50 percent dry matter content. \""One of the major reasons why wrapped forages have become popular is that storage of wrapped bales is not weather dependent,\"" says Müller. But even among wrapped forages, extreme cold weather can complicate feeding. \""A drawback in the north is that cold weather (below 0 degree Celsius) results in frozen bales during winter, which are very difficult to separate before feeding. Haylage does not pose this problem.\"" Wrapped forages are sometimes used in conjunction with traditional dried hay to stretch the supply through the winter months. Beyond the forage challenges, many Swedish feeding practices are similar to those in the United States. A recent study of Swedish horse owners found that 60 percent use commercial feed mixes, 50 percent use beet pulp with molasses, 80 percent feed a mineral supplement and 50 percent feed a vitamin supplement. The Netherlands: An abundance of choices How much could the Netherlands and the United States have in common when it comes to feeding horses? It\'s a valid question: After all, the western European country is 237 times smaller than America, with limited, low-lying pastures and a climate that is famously wet and mild. It\'s a far cry from the expansive, dry plains of Texas or the snowy mountains of Vermont. But the Dutch culture is as \""horsey\"" as any, with approximately 500,000 regular riders out of a population of only 17 million caring for 450,000 horses. Riding is the second most popular sport in the country, after soccer. Not surprisingly, then, there is a huge industry to support the Dutch equestrian pursuits, and this creates common ground between horse owners in the United States and the Netherlands: Both groups have a huge variety of choice when it comes to feeding. \""There are at least 50 to 60 different pelleted concentrates and mixtures from 10 to 20 different companies [available in the The Netherlands],\"" says Marianne Sloet van Oldruitenborgh-Oosterbaan, DVM, PhD, of Utrecht University. Like their American counterparts, many Dutch horse owners make the most of this variety by mixing different grain products and adding supplements to customize meals for each horse \""Many owners will buy commercial concentrates,\"" says Sloet van Oldruitenborgh-Oosterbaan. \""But there are also a lot of people that make mixes. Horses from individual horse owners get sometimes 10 or more different products over the week.\""Even with these choices, Dutch horse owners do face feeding challenges. One of the biggest, says Sloet van Oldruitenborgh-Oosterbaan, is lack of access to pasture in winter. \""Most horses get no pasture [during that time] as it is too wet,\"" she says. To compensate, silage and/or hay is fed. She recommends to her clients that rations be broken up into at least three to four feedings a day, with the first meal at 7 a.m. and the last at 11 p.m. Italy: Holding fast to traditionsAdherence to horsekeeping traditions can be useful, but sometimes the \""old ways\"" certainly aren\'t better. In Italy, the reluctance of horse owners to modernize has frustrated some equine nutritionists, including Emanuela Valle, DVM, PhD, ECVCN, diplomate of the University of Turin. In 2009, Valle published a large-scale study of feeding practices of elite and mid-level show jumpers in Italy, writing in the conclusion: \""The feeding plan management is based only to achieve a good body condition score, without taking into account other important factors for the welfare of the horse.... Little attention is paid to the nutrition of sport horses, even if they are top eventers. They still receive a diet based only on meadow hay and simple cereals according to Italian tradition; horse owners often think that grandfather\'s way of horse feeding is still good because they don\'t really feel the impact on performance.\""Breaking with tradition in Italy may be more difficult, says Valle, because of limited availability of more modern feeds and the lack of information. \""The choice is not so big like in America,\"" she says. \""There are some local Italian companies that produce feed for horses, but many times they are also producing other products like the feed for rabbits. We also have a few feeds from big brands in other countries. Senior feed at the moment is not a big market, even as the number of aged horses is increasing.\"" She adds that for some owners tradition is still strong. They spend lot of effort in preparing \""cooked\"" meals even for a barn with 60 horses. \""We still have places where they do the cereal mashes in the winter once a week. They cook the cereals for one hour (1 kg for each 500 kg horse) and add cooked linseed and bran.\""Even while holding to tradition, Italian horsekeepers have adopted a few modern feeding practices. Overall management of nutrition of horses is improving, says Valle, especially in the market of supplements. Valle says products for joint support and to prevent gastric ulcers are common, as are calming supplements. Australia: Risks in a rugged landscapeAustralia may be known for its koala bears and spiders the size of a man\'s hand, but it\'s home to plenty of horses as well. From racehorses to pleasure horses to working ranch horses, the Land Down Under supports a thriving equine industry. Feeding programs for Australian horses are similar to those in the United States but are shaped by challenges specific to the island nation\'s often-difficult physical environment.\""[Equine diets] are variable from owner to owner,\"" says Mick McCluskey, BVSc, MACVS, a veterinarian in Victoria. \""Rye grass/clover or lucerne (alfalfa) are the main two hays. Oaten and lucerne chaff are commonly used as well. Hay pellets are available, but they are not very commonly used.\""Increasingly, Australian horses receive commercial feed mixes. \""Ease of feeding and lowering of costs have made premixed feeds more popular, especially in the racing industry,\"" says McCluskey. \""A large and ever-expanding variety of premixed rations is available, including a number of senior feeds.\"" With plenty of land available, turnout is easy to provide to the horses of Australia. \""Most pleasure horses are housed in paddocks of varying size, usually with pasture,\"" says McCluskey. \""Full-time stabling or yarding [without turnout] is uncommon.\"" However, grazing in Australia carries certain risks. Nearly 1,000 poisonous plants have been identified in the country, so \""the main challenge in some regions is access to toxic weeds because so many horses are kept on pasture,\"" says McCluskey. \""Other regions have issues with sand consumption and associated health problems like sand colic and diarrhea because of feeding directly off the ground.\""Honduras: Horses at workIn the Central American country of Honduras, horsekeeping often isn\'t a pastime or hobby. In many cases, horses are working animals and contribute to the livelihood of a rural family. Working horses in the country tend to be fed differently than pleasure horses, due to the demands of their jobs and the resources of their owners.For instance, a pleasure horse may have continual access to hay all day, but \""working horses are typically fed before or after work, and in some cases they are only fed after work,\"" says Daniela Robles, president of Equinos de Honduras, a nonprofit organization that promotes equine welfare and owner education throughout that country. \""In the south region of Honduras (Choluteca), which is the area we are currently working in, it is very difficult to find high-quality pastures due to the fact that Choluteca is a very arid and dry place where pastures barely grow in summer,\"" says Robles. \""Only people with economic resources and large amounts of terrain have access to high-quality pastures during the summer, and if they buy hay, it is very expensive. Since owners of working horses have fewer resources, they provide corn grains or very small rations of concentrate (one pound every three days) when grazing is reduced.\"" Few commercially made concentrates are available in Honduras. \""Horseman don\'t have many choices among premixed feeds since they are not formulated specifically for horses,\"" says Robles. \""Most of them are more recommended for cows or other livestock.\"" Even if they are able to find it, only owners of pleasure and sport horses are likely to use commercial grains, as they can be expensive, while working horse owners make their own mixes of grain. The importance of keeping hard- working horses fed is so widely recognized that other local industries often assist in the effort, says Robles. \""Choluteca is an ideal area for planting sugar cane, so we have sugar cane companies all over the south region in Honduras. The areas where sugar cane grows provide the conditions for pastures to grow as well, so these sugar cane companies allow working horse owners to cut grass to feed their horses during the summer because the companies know that these people rely on their horses to obtain their daily income.\"" Not surprisingly, the sugar industry also supplies a common treat for all types of horses in Honduras. \""The treats given to horses when they do a good job are made of rapadura, an unrefined cane sugar,\"" says Robles.While the specific types of hay and grains fed to horses may vary from country to country, the anticipatory nicker heard at feeding time is a universal language recognized by all horsepeople. That call---when a horse simultaneously says \""hurry up\"" and \""thank you\""---is one of those little things that brighten a horsekeeper\'s day, providing reassurance that our effort is appreciated, no matter what country we call home. ",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGXcjxv_88_CvuC1ipUGs6d0d3czA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=nvh_WtDcEJX_WOOsgoAN&url=https://equusmagazine.com/management/feeding-round-the-world,EN,,11/02/2018 08:00,2018-02-11 04:04:37+00:00,6b7af8fb69,EQUUS Magazine,,,,,1518325477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
da6ddc9018,"Game & small-stock: different management, the same care - Farmer\'s Weekly","different management, the same care<br />According to game and small-stock farmer, Emilize Vögel, being a farm manager is an extremely rewarding job. One of its greatest perks is spending time out in nature.Photo: Roelof BezuidenhoutEmilize Vögel, farm manager of Wagondrift Farming, believes in managing animals so that losses are minimised, and her initiation into breeding sable antelope certainly attests to this philosophy.While transporting Wagondrift\'s first group of sable antelope to the farm, Langveld, in the Steytlerville district in the south-eastern Karoo, she was forced to spend the night in a small town waiting out a heavy storm.The situation was tricky. Although she dared not risk losing the valuable cargo on the muddy 16km road out to the farm, she also did not want to leave the animals unguarded.Undaunted, she simply parked the truck in a quiet side street, grabbed a blanket and pillow, and curled up on the front seat until sunrise.She remembers reasoning: \""This is crazy, but is spending the night with a group of Sable any different to swimming with dolphins? It depends on where your passion lies.\""Since this incident two years ago, Wagondrift Farming\'s sable herd at Langveld has grown to 30 without suffering a single mortality or other mishap. This, say neighbours, attests to Emilize\'s almost uncanny knack with animals, wild or otherwise.She bonds with them and cares for them, and is usually amply rewarded for her efforts.A lesson well-learnt\""Look after your animals and they\'ll look after you,\"" Emilize stresses. \""I learnt that from my late mother, Julie, on our family farm, Doornkroon [in the same district], where I grew up. It was a relatively small farm, and her recipe for survival was to give every sheep individual attention. It paid off in terms of lambing and weaning percentages.\""However, despite her obvious aptitude for animal rearing, Emilize waited for many years before she put her passion into practice.\""I started out in banking, moved to hospital administration, and later became a real estate agent. I then returned home and I helped my mother on the farm, until she passed away and Doornkroon was sold.\""This was followed by a stint on a hunting ranch. Then, in 2015, Pieter and Pietie Ferreira of Wagondrift Farming in Hankey, Gamtoos River Valley, asked me to join them.\""Although the Ferreiras were primarily fruit and vegetable farmers, they had, for many years, dreamed of establishing a game and livestock farm in the Karoo, recalls Emilize.\""So I supervised the building of game-proof fencing on Langveld, before establishing the sables, nyalas, springbok and more recently, Kudu and black impala on one section of the farm. We run Dorper sheep on the other part.\""Keep your eyes openEmilize shares another lesson learnt from her mother: never start the day without plans in place, both for the short and long term. Having a Plan?B is also a must, as things often go awry on a farm. It is no less important to anticipate both good and adverse market conditions. Farming, after all, is about making a profit.\""The saying that the difference between a good farmer and a bad one is only a few days is so true,\"" she says.Emilize points to a few examples to illustrate her point:Failing to regularly check the status of stock watering reservoirs or drinking troughs can lead to untold trouble, should a camp run out of water.During a typical Karoo drought, the greatest challenge is probably managing the veld properly. It is vital that there is enough grazing available.Putting off inoculations against maladies such as pulpy kidney disease, until it\'s too late, can lead to heavy losses.Neglecting to patrol fences, or checking for holes in fences, could allow predators to enter the farm or game to escape. In a nutshell, it is crucial to keep one\'s eyes open at all times.\""I\'m never without my binoculars. They\'re indispensable for spotting trouble at a distance or doing quick game counts,\"" she says.Small-stock vs gameEmilize explains that there are both similarities and differences between managing game and sheep. Both require good nutrition and clean water, and neither take weekends off; constant care is a must.Sable, she admits, are obviously more visually appealing, especially galloping across the plains, than a flock of sheep quietly grazing. But sheep, being domestic, allow for a hands-on approach. \""You get into much closer contact with sheep, and can handle them without darting,\"" she explains.She also finds antelope behaviour fascinating, and highly varied. Sable cows, for example, hide their newborn calves in bushes until they have gained strength. The cows then call their calves with eerie, barely audible whistles.Nyalas are shy, staying in the thorn thickets most of the time, and bristle their coats when disturbed. Springbok and other gazelles are famed for their dramatic pronking behaviour.BreedingIn selecting a Sable breeding bull, Emilize looks for a strong body, and horns that curve slightly outwards from a broad base. Sable horns grow at about 1\"" (2,5cm) per month for the first three years, after which growth slows considerably.The horns take a long time to reach the target of around 50\"" (1,28m).\""In Dorper rams, I look, among others, for good length and depth of body, and a strong head and muzzle. Ewes that have poor udders or abnormalities in the udder or teats get culled, as milk is what makes lambs grow.\""While Emilize enjoys working outdoors and experiencing nature first-hand, she admits that the job has its difficulties.\""It can get tough, especially when things suddenly go wrong, and you have to go full throttle to limit or prevent losses, and then catch up again with scheduled tasks.A farmer is so many professions rolled into one, from personnel manager and bookkeeper to marketer and engineer, that you have to know something about just about everything.\""She says that although many women feel intimidated by the prospect of entering the predominantly male-orientated profession of farming, there is no reason they should not succeed, especially if encouraged by family and employers.The ready availability of information today also makes the job more manageable.\""I try to read up as much as I can, talk to other farmers to stay abreast of developments, visit other farms to compare notes, and attend stock and game auctions whenever I can,\"" she says.Emilize\'s management tipsThe Steytlerville Karoo receives an average rainfall of only 230mm to 250mm, but the veld is known for its wide variety of nutritious dwarf Karoo shrubs and succulents that maintain their grazing value even during normal dry conditions. But according to Emilize Vögel, below-average rainfall over the past two years has made supplementary feeding essential for maintaining the condition and health of both sheep and game.\""The worst thing you can do is allow your animals to lose too much weight before giving them extra feed,\"" she says. \""Feed is expensive, so you have to do your sums, but at current prices for lamb of more than R70/kg, a well-planned feeding programme focused on reproduction and weaning weights should pay dividends.\"" However, while it is always safe to feed lucerne hay or teff, supplementing diet formulations on a large scale has to be carried out carefully, as animals can quickly develop digestive problems. Emilize emphasises the need for sound advice before starting a feeding programme.Generally, game is far easier to manage than sheep, which require much stricter disease and parasite control. However, in extensive farming areas, predators such as caracal and jackal can be a danger to both game and small-stock, and can often catch farmers unawares.\""I try to do all I can to keep predators away from vulnerable animals by regularly checking fences for holes or loose strands of wire,\"" says Emilize.

da7428362e,The Perils of Pakistani Migrants Heading to Europe - Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting,"The Perils of Pakistani Migrants Heading to Europe<br />When Mohammed Ismail was 11 years old, his maternal uncle disappeared from their village in Gujrat. Nobody heard from him; nobody knew where he had gone. Some worried he might have had an accident, or died, but Ismail\'s mother was insistent that the dead don\'t pack belongings for their graves. <br />Two months later, he called on a landline phone-the only one in the neighborhood. It was a few streets away from Ismail\'s home and was installed at the house of a woman whose husband worked as a laborer in Dubai. <br />Ismail\'s uncle was in Greece. He had found work on the docks in one of the islands, he was safe, he was also sorry. He had to sell some family heirloom, jewellery, to be able to venture that far but he would be compensating his sister for that soon. He apologized for making everyone worry but there had been no time to explain. The immigration agent arranging his journey demanded immediate departure.<br />Traveling without official documentation required both secrecy and urgency. <br />For the next 10 years, Ismail heard stories about his uncle\'s life abroad. His uncle would travel often, sometimes for work, sometimes on the run from immigration authorities; he moved around inside Greece, then left for France, eventually settling in Spain. <br />He opened a shop on the famous La Rambla street in central Barcelona, a place with such a dense population of migrant business owners from Pakistan that people from Punjab speak of finding long lost relatives there while buying cigarettes. <br />Ismail also came to know of other migrant settlements, like Southall in London, where some of his distant relatives were now running a grocery store. Just two years after starting college at the University of Gujrat as an engineering student, he dropped out, put together some money, packed his bags and decided to try his luck abroad as well. This was 2008; he was 21 at the time.<br />Back when he had both his legs. <br />* * * *<br />When I met him in early 2016, Ismail was sitting on a chair supported by crutches. His left leg was in a resting position and his right was stumped above the knee.<br />\""It still hurts sometimes even though the doctor says it\'s just in my head,\"" he says, lighting up a cigarette. Ismail is 29 now but looks much older; his face has scraggy lines; he tells me he sits out in the sun all day, smoking, thinking. <br />\""The bullet entered right here,\"" he points to where his kneecap would have been. \""It was agonizing.\"" Ismail was shot just inside the Turkish border a few nautical miles from Greece. <br />Eight years ago, he got a telephone number of an immigration agent from a friend whose brother had recently gone to Turkey. He saved it on his cell phone. For a week he did not call, every night he would lay on a charpoy in the courtyard of his house, staring at the stars, wondering whether some great destiny awaited him on foreign shores, whether to take the plunge like his uncle had. <br />What swayed him was the monotony of that week. The same tired old routine, the same tired old faces. He was young and full of energy; what was the point of wilting away like this? It would be another two years before he graduated. Then he would start the struggle to find a job. Some of the graduates from his village were now working as clerks. <br />Dead end vocations did not appeal to Ismail. <br />He started asking people for small loans; friends, relatives, anyone who could lend him a few thousand rupees. He needed to put together 300,000 rupees in total. Some of that he got from his father on the pretext of college semester fees. He sold his motorcycle and borrowed from his uncle, who assured him he would be taken care of in Europe. The money would get him three attempts to go abroad. There was no refund on a foiled attempt. <br />He sent the agent half the total in advance, through a visa consultancy on the Grand Trunk Road in Gujrat. <br />\""My heart was pounding. It was a lot of money. I was afraid he might run away with it.\"" <br />Ismail got a call the next evening, confirming his deposit. He was told to get to Quetta in a week\'s time. He got his train ticket and confided in some close friends so they may tell his parents after he had left.He did not want to tell them himself. <br />* * * *<br />He left in the dead of the night. Just like his uncle. He took a night coach to Rawalpindi and then boarded the Jaffar Express to Quetta. The agent had told him to wear sneakers and jeans and to bring a jacket along with him. It gets cold in the mountains he would have to traverse. On the train, he spotted other people who carried backpacks as big as his. He recognized one of them as someone from a nearby village. <br />\""Are you also here with Sheikh sahib\'s man?\"" Ismail asked the other traveler, who nodded in affirmation. <br />Sheikh sahib was the reference through which to contact the agent, one of the many aliases and pseudonyms people in the immigration business use; agents come and go but aliases stay. It makes it easier for potential clients and harder for law enforcers to find them out. <br />Ismail stepped down onto the platform at Quetta\'s railway station as the train whistled to a stop, and saw policemen standing close by. For a minute he panicked. Then he remembered he had others with him and quietly followed them out. <br />Fifteen young men on a warm August morning: backpacks slung across their shoulders; all with the same instructions-to wait for a phone call. <br />The agent called Ismail and told him to exit the station. There was a wedding hall opposite the main gate where a rickshaw driver was waiting, phone in hand. <br />\""Where do you want to go, brother?\"" He asked, taking the phone off his ear.<br />\""Very far,\"" replied Ismail.<br />The rickshaw took Ismail to a dilapidated house; three other boys were already sitting there. There were mattresses on the floor; they could rest until nightfall when a rented car would come for them. <br />The car was a diesel saloon. They were to go through mountainous terrain. <br />\""The road was terrible,\"" recalls Ismail. \""The driver would sometimes turn off the lights and I wondered how he could see where he was going. What if we fell off the side of the mountain?\""<br />The drive was long and treacherous. <br />The distance between Quetta and Taftan, a town on Pakistan\'s border with Iran, is about 650 kilometers. Summer rains wash away the makeshift roads, which are taken not just to avoid being apprehended - though, technically, no laws are being broken moving within Pakistan - but also to save money on bribes. The Frontier Corps (FC) personnel in charge of the western border regions have a reputation here; as do the local police. <br />The idea was to get to Taftan when the border gates open at dawn: to blend in with Shia pilgrims headed for Iran and local residents crossing the border to visit friends and families living on the other side. Ismail was told that he had a genuine visit visa to Iran; his handler in Quetta gave it to him in exchange for the other half of the money. <br />He did not know if this was true but he was about to find out. <br />They reached Taftan at daybreak and Ismail and his fellow migrants joined the swelling crowd. He walked up to the Iranian border guard, trembling; he produced his documents; there was a moment of silence; everything came to a standstill; he could hear his pulse in his ears, feel it in his neck, then the guard nodded dismissively and pointed him onwards.<br />Ismail could breathe again.<br />* * * *<br />\""I was given a SIM to use in Iran and another agent\'s number. He told me to keep walking until I saw a line of Khodro pickups.\"" <br />He did not have to walk far. He saw them parked at a little distance and his fellow backpackers heading in that general direction. Some of the drivers were busy conversing with Iranian border guards. <br />He boarded one of the pickups; five others joined him in the back of the same vehicle and they took off for Tehran. It was a long drive. Ismail remembers feeling cramp, tired, hungry. They only stopped once for food, at a roadside stall, where the people in the front switched seats and the man who had been sleeping all day drove all night.<br />It took two days to get to a seedy rest house in Tehran. <br />They were again ushered into a tiny room where they had to improvise a good night\'s sleep because now their real journey began: first to Bazargan (an Iranian town on the border with Turkey) and then on to Turkey. They would have to travel much of the way on foot. <br />The walking was the worst part of his journey. Their handlers kept a relentless pace. \""We were carrying enormous weight on our backs; we could not keep up. But if we stopped for breath, they would shout at us, push us; they had sticks, one of them had a gun.\""<br />There were 20 people in Ismail\'s group - and three handlers. They walked for what seemed like an eternity, until his feet were covered in blisters and his calves burned. The handlers did not speak his language; they only knew a few phrases about food, rest and, most importantly, moving. By now, there were Afghans and Bengalis with him as well. They could not communicate with each other either - except about food, rest and the dread of having to continuously move. <br />They camped on rocky terrain for a few hours every night. Feeding on scraps. They slipped on mud and sleet, fell down, bruised their knees, tore their clothes; they walked to an abandoned looking trucking station where they were instructed to get into the back of a lorry and hide inside a container, it took them a while to realise they were just inside Turkey. <br />Ismail remembers the suffocating feeling, the claustrophobia. Sitting inside the metal box - scrunched up, body aching, the stifling darkness-and being terrified of never seeing daylight again. The truck would stop for ages in between its noisy motion, Ismail would hear loud conversations going on outside, sometimes hands would bang against the container door, and sounds of anger. He was told to remain silent and not cause a commotion; they all were. <br />Live merchandise had to slip through the inspection cracks just like other forms of smuggling. Bribes had to be paid here like everywhere else. <br />The agony lasted forever. When the doors opened again Ismail was almost in a state of delirium. Dehydrated, disoriented. New handlers waited to drive them to the outskirts of Istanbul, where they were fed again and put up in a shack, like cattle. The farther he got from home, the less human Ismail felt.<br />\""I started regretting it then. But I was too far into it. I thought if I could just survive till Greece, I would be safe, I would be okay.\""<br />In Istanbul, he was given two choices. \""I could either sit in another container or I could go to Greece by speedboat.\""<br />His handlers insisted on the container route through Bulgaria. They said the weather was rough and the Aegean Sea was perilous. There was a high chance that an overloaded speedboat with dozens of migrants would capsize. \""But I chose the speedboat. I was exhausted. I did not want to go near another container. I wanted it to be over.\""<br />A choice he would regret almost immediately.<br />Ismail was sent near the city of Çanakkale from where he was to reach one of the Greek islands close by. The speedboat operators here make money off migrants and they readily abandon them if the going gets tough, having no personal stake in their lives.<br />As soon as Ismail\'s speedboat left shore, it started swaying and swinging on the tides. It tilted several times and just stopped short of tipping over, the tumult of the sea forced the operator to turn around and head back to Turkey. It was not at the same spot from where they had left, having veered in the storm.<br />They had hardly touched back down when they heard the loud blast of a rifle.<br />An air shot, followed by sirens. The men in the speedboats shouted something to each other and started running away. Ismail and the others followed them in the confusion.<br />More shots were fired; their reverberations getting louder. Ismail heard a soft whooshing sound and felt searing pain in his leg. He let out a cry and collapsed. Nobody stopped to help him. Ismail remembers uniformed men coming to pick him up; he remembers receiving medical attention and then he remembers sleeping a lot.<br />He was arrested and deported. First to Iran and then to Pakistan. By the time he got to Quetta again, his leg was constantly in pain and the medication he was given was not helping him at all.<br />There were mixed emotions on his return home: anger, relief, admonition, love. He was taken to a doctor in Gujrat. The doctor examined his leg and told him that it was badly infected and that the infection would spread if left unchecked. In the end, they decided to amputate it. <br />\""It was hell, I came back with less than what I left with.\""<br />Would he have tried a second time had he not met with such a tragedy?<br />\""No, never. I would have never tried again.\""<br />But many do.<br />* * * *<br />Unlike Ismail, most migrants travel to Greece in rubber dinghies from the coastal areas around Izmir, Turkey. Over 800,000 refugees and migrants traversed the Aegean Sea from Turkey to get to Greece in 2015, accounting for 80 per cent of the people arriving irregularly in Europe by sea.<br />This year, Pakistanis make up the fourth biggest group of undocumented migrants arriving in Greece-after Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis. When these migrants are registered in Greece, they get 30-day transit papers and are subsequently sent back. Usually they end up at the Turkish port of Dikili in Izmir. <br />Some of them apply for asylum in Greece to prolong their stay since they cannot be deported before their asylum request is processed. But what most are looking for is time, and an opportunity to run away to Italy, Germany, France, England and Spain. <br />Beginning in April this year, Greece began deporting asylum seekers whose applications were rejected; many of the deportees are Pakistani. Nearly 400 people have been sent back and 190 of them are Pakistanis. Others are from Morocco, Iran, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.<br />In violation of the terms of the Geneva Convention, European authorities appear to be judging asylum claims based on nationality, not individual cases. Pakistanis are generally being categorized as \""economic migrants\"" and not refugees. Simultaneously, Turkey has worked out a readmission agreement with Pakistan in order to deport Pakistanis back to their homeland. <br />A 2015 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the number of deportees sent back to Pakistan at more than 50,000 annually in recent years. It also puts applications for asylums by Pakistani nationals in Europe at an average of around 11,000 a year. Those who attempt to stay undocumented and are intercepted later also number at around 10,000 on average - with a considerable spike in 2012, when the figure jumped by nearly 50 per cent from 2011. Considering there are many who never get caught, it is safe to say that well over 71,000 people try to leave Pakistan annually. <br />* * * *<br />Moria is a detention facility on the Greek island of Lesbos. Barbed wire fences surround a primitive tent camp that is guarded by the Greek police. Inside the camp, there are a dozen shipping containers surrounded by more fences. The immigrants call that place \""jail\"" There are frequent protests and fights here due to food shortages and squalid living conditions.<br />Hassan, a father of four from Lahore, reached through a cell phone inside the camp, explains that people are typically placed inside the \""jail\"" before being deported. Pakistanis, who make up a sizable portion of those locked inside Moria, have held many protests, including hunger strikes. A couple of months ago, one protest turned violent after a fire broke out in a cell where juvenile migrants were imprisoned. Asylum seekers threw rocks at the police who retaliated with tear gas. Some migrants escaped from the camp in the melee. After hours of clashes, police rounded up the escapees and brought them back to Moria. The chaos repeated itself on June 1. According to preliminary reports, the violence and ensuing fire erupted due to a clash between Afghan and Pakistani migrants. <br />Back home in Pakistan, Hassan\'s life was under serious threat. He escaped multiple assassination attempts that stemmed from a family feud. He moved his family to a village for safety and then fled to Europe, hoping to bring his family later. <br />In Istanbul, Hassan was taken hostage. He was locked in a basement for more than a month, along with other migrant prisoners, beaten and told he would be killed. He was finally released after his family paid 3000 Euros in ransom. \""Turkey is not a safe country,\"" he says. <br />Pakistanis living at an informal camp-called No Borders Kitchen-on the island of Lesbos repeated different versions of the same story. No Borders Kitchen was raided by the police in late April this year and more than 300 immigrants living there, mostly Pakistani, were moved to Moria. <br />Pakistanis and other immigrants in Greece are feeling increasingly desperate. Michael Eder, a psychologist from Austria volunteering at No Borders Kitchen, believes half of the migrants are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \""If [the police] use force, the people can be re-traumatized. In severe cases, this can lead to suicide,\"" he explains. <br />In April, Naser Baloch, in his twenties, climbed an electric pole at Moria and threatened to hang himself with a scarf. Hassan is an eyewitness to this. Eventually, other immigrants coaxed Baloch down but he fainted and was transferred to a hospital. After a medical examination, he was sent back to Moria where he is imprisoned with Pakistanis, North Africans and other immigrants not likely to get asylum. <br />Another Baloch man-Omer, 35-is in a jail in the Greek town of Kavalla and is suffering from some psychological disorder: he does not speak any more. <br />* * * *<br />Last December in Idomeni camp, on the Greek side of the Greece-Macedonia border, hundreds of pop-up tents littered fields running adjacent to the border and train rails. During the cold nights, immigrants from many countries burned whatever combustible materials they could find, ripping branches from trees and burning dirty clothes, plastic and blankets. Denied permission to cross the border, dozens of Iranians and Pakistanis held daily protests that sometimes turned violent. <br />A week after the protests, Greek authorities forcibly moved the men to large camps in Athens. Greece now has dozens of camps spread across the country. Several are in Athens while many others are located in other cities, villages and remote areas. Many are run by the Greek military where the migrants are provided with military-type food rations and army tents. <br />The more desirable camps consist of empty shipping containers. At least one container camp exists near Athens and another in Lesbos. These camps are filled with Syrians and Iraqis. Others, who are less likely to get asylum, like Afghans and Pakistanis, are living in cramped camps like the one at Eliniko, the abandoned former Athens airport, or at the ferry port of Piraeus where they wait-their fate unknown. <br />* * * *<br />At an asylum office in Athens, Qadeer Sagar Baloch, 27, and his friends tried to explain their situation to an asylum officer. They carried with them a letter written by one Faiz Mohammed Baloch who runs the International Voice for Baloch Missing Persons from an office in London. It read: \""We are convinced if these individuals are forced to return to Balochistan...they will be arrested, tortured and killed by Pakistani army and security agencies. Therefore, we request the government and immigration authorities of Greece not deport these individuals to Pakistan.\""<br />\""It is a really sensitive case,\"" says Danish activist Henriette Holm who is trying to help them. Their lives are in danger in Balochistan, she says.<br />The security situation in Balochistan has deteriorated in the past years, says Faiz. His group investigates claims about disappeared persons who he says number more than 20,000 (the government in Pakistan insists the number is not more than a few hundred). \""We want to provide some comfort to their families, even if they are killed, so that their relatives do not have to live in limbo.\"" <br />Faiz has prepared a list of ten Baloch activists who arrived in Greece around the same time as Sagar did earlier this year. He knows of another ten who tried to go to Italy. Countless others have been trying to reach Western Europe but he cannot determine their numbers unless they reach out to his organization.<br />A group of Baloch men, including Shahrukh, 23, was staying in the camp at Idomeni in December, 2015. He says he was treated as an alien in his own country and claims to have lost 36 family members in the violence that plagues Balochistan. <br />* * * *<br />Sagar and his three Baloch companions share a room with six Punjabi men in a dirty and drug-infested neighborhood of Athens. Each pays 50 Euros monthly in rent. The room is dark and there are mattresses on the floor. A single light illuminates the corroded walls. Days are spent in desperation, as they consume their diminishing savings and see the door to Western Europe closed. Still, they hope that the EU authorities will come to understand their plight, their reason for leaving home and their legitimate fears of being targeted for imprisonment, torture and death at home. For Sagar and his friends, the chances of reaching Germany or the United Kingdom are increasingly remote. <br />Sagar has been active in the Baloch National Movement, an organization which aims to create an independent state for the Baloch, divided in areas that are part of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. For years, the Baloch have received asylum protection in European countries but nowadays Sagar and his companions, along with many others, are stuck in Greece, a country suffering from widespread unemployment and in deep economic crisis. <br />With the largest annual influx of immigrants to Europe in recent history recorded in 2015, the EU countries have closed their borders in March, and made agreements with other countries to be able to deport asylum seekers. The Baloch are worried about being categorized as citizens of Pakistan which the EU considers a safe country. <br />\""Here in Greece,\"" Sagar says, \""we are in deep trouble.\"" <br />He insists he did not leave his homeland for economic reasons but because of real threats he experienced due to his political work. \""I was threatened by phone,\"" he recalls. The voice on the other end said, \""I will kill you.\"" A month later, two men entered the metal shop he owned in Mand town in Turbat, carrying Kalashnikovs. Sagar hid and then ran out through the back of the shop. He changed his mobile phone number and stopped going to the shop, which he later sold for about 10,000 Euros in order to finance his trip to Europe. <br />When Sagar left home in January 2016, he was informed that the European borders were open and it would be possible to travel to Germany or even the United Kingdom. Leaving behind his wife and 11-month-old son, he traveled from Pakistan to Iran, and then into Turkey. \""We walked nine hours through the mountains in order to get to Turkey. It was cold and icy and Turkish police were firing at us. One of our friends was caught near the border and sent back to Iran.\"" He made it across Iran in his third attempt. <br />From Turkey, they took a rubber dinghy across the sea to the Greek islands. The journey was grueling and dangerous. The small boat was packed with immigrants. The driver, an Afghan and an immigrant himself, had never before captained a boat. Halfway across, the petrol ran out. They were stuck in the water, battling waves and wind. After dialing an emergency number, they were rescued by the Greek Coast Guard. They were taken to the island of Lesbos where they boarded a ferry to Athens and then they could move no farther.<br />Weeks before Sagar\'s arrival in Greece, the European borders were closed to many asylum seekers. About 54,000 migrants of various ethnicities are stuck in Greece. <br />* * * *<br />The concept of transit migration really emerged in the last two decades as stricter migration policies and airport security in destination countries forced people to take dangerous routes, travelling through places that could offer shared borders with their European destinations. <br />Pakistan has served as a source, transit and destination country for migrants and human traffickers due to its porous western borders. <br />The effects of great upheavals in the region, like the 1979 revolution in Iran, or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, have had tremendous impact on human movement. The mass exodus of asylum seekers and political refugees from Iran, both legal and illegal, opened routes to Europe and connected them all the way to villages in northern and central Punjab. <br />Many transit migrants also end up settling in Turkey and Greece, unable to afford going further. This is the explanation proffered by authorities in Pakistan when asked why networks of immigration agents are so widespread and efficient: The agents were originally migrants, mainly from Pakistan and Iran. They have contacts both in their home countries and their adopted ones. <br />The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) claims to have arrested as many as 1,310 human smugglers last year, mostly facilitators and sub-agents, launched 7,500 enquiries and recovered 11 billion rupees as a result. It also claims to have intercepted around 6,600 intending migrants in 2015. A mere trickle in the deluge of outward migration. <br />America\'s State Department publishes an annual Trafficking In Person (TIP) report which ranks countries on a three-tier rating system based on their compliance with international human trafficking regulations. In 2014, Pakistan was demoted from its long-standing Tier 2 rank (which includes countries where human smuggling and trafficking originates from, like India) down to the Tier 2 Watch List, joining a group of some 44 countries including Afghanistan-a rank which is only a small step above Tier 3, which includes countries that exercise no border control, like Syria.<br />Iran, incidentally, is also ranked in Tier 3. <br />There is, therefore, mounting international pressure on Pakistan, the Ministry of Interior and through it the FIA, to curb attempted migration and improve border control, clamping down on both human trafficking and smuggling. This pressure does not translate into performance for a multitude of reasons, says Mahr Usman, the FIA\'s additional director for immigration. <br />He is functionally in charge of a dedicated immigration desk at the FIA headquarters in Islamabad. Its regular function is to collate data from all FIA circles around the country and coordinate with the Ministry of Interior which oversees the FIA and signs repatriation and extradition treaties with other countries. <br />Usman has three years of field experience working at the FIA\'s airport checkpoints. His job was to check suspicious documents and make judgment calls based on tip-offs; these could come from any source-neighbours, relatives, even agents themselves at times. The FIA officials at airports work closely with customs offices, airport security forces and civil aviation authorities. People with suspect documentation are detained and interrogated on the airport premises. <br />Immigration was first made an FIA concern in 1974, after the first wave of overseas employment agreements saw thousands of Pakistanis migrating to the Gulf states, Usman explains. The sheer volume of migration encouraged illicit means of traveling that allowed paperwork to be circumvented and travel and visa costs paid in installments; thus came about the demand for illegal immigration agents.<br />Law enforcement lagged far behind these developments. It was only in 2002 that the Prevention and Control of Human Trafficking Ordinance was passed. Usman explains that no specific law existed prior to the promulgation of this ordinance to deal with offenses and culprits related to human trafficking and human smuggling.<br />The FIA was largely toothless before this ordinance, Usman contends. It still is in many ways.<br />* * * *<br />Usman recalls the migratory swell of people from Mirpur (in Azad Kashmir), Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat and Jhelum (all in Punjab) in the 1970s and 1980s when laborers first went abroad en masse. They started sending remittance, their families back home bought lands and cemented their houses. Their neighbors and relatives would see the material improvement and wish it for themselves. <br />Able-bodied young men willing to travel to another country became a family dream. They were family investments, and immigration agents were suddenly much sought after.<br />Usman says Dubai\'s construction boom started the cascade. Contractors needed cheap labour which was imported from countries like Pakistan, legally at first, through overseas employment visas, but the demand for a larger and even cheaper workforce grew at a faster pace than the legal supply. Many migrants, since they knew the process, became agents to cater to this demand. The contractors did not care how the laborers arrived.<br />The global network of travel agents, visa consultants and human smugglers traverses lines of legality and illegality with consummate ease. <br />\""A lot of people still get genuine visas to Iran, Dubai, even Turkey, and then try to abscond from there into Europe,\"" Usman explains. <br />Facilitators, sub-agents, document forgers, they are everywhere. \""It is not just our problem. Has Iran or Turkey managed to eradicate their agent networks? It takes two to tango. If people go from here, they also get help from the places they are traveling to.\""<br />This is a valid point. Earlier last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed a press conference about the perennially ongoing negotiations between Turkey and the EU over what the latter feels is insufficient border policing by the former. Erdogan made it clear that Turkey would improve border control only if the EU allowed free movement for Turkish citizens inside Europe. It is clear from the statement that Turkey can do more; it just wants more incentives to do so.<br />Pakistan likewise does not have great incentives to better police its borders, says Usman. There is a distinct perception among official circles that it is a case of \'better their problem than ours\'. A huge expatriate population that contributes to the economy via remittances is an advantage that Pakistan wants to maintain even if parts of it are functioning beyond legal channels. <br />Then there are turf battles over jurisdiction within government departments. <br />\""Firstly, the FIA does not control the border. The FC controls the land border. The Coast Guard is in charge of the marine border. The FIA has only two border checkpoints along 3000 kilometers of land border with Afghanistan and Iran. Even these checkpoints are understaffed,\"" Usman says. \""The FIA does not have the resources to pursue people inland. We have no legal authority to arrest anyone before they have attempted to leave the country.\""<br />The FIA also does not have the capacity to detain all the migrants who come back on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. The detainees are produced before a magistrate who then imposes a nominal fine on them for attempting illegal migration. The fine may range anywhere between 500 rupees and 2,500 rupees. In accordance with the existing laws, they are then set free. <br />This lack of punishment is one major reason why most migrants make second and third attempts when the first is foiled, argues Usman. \""The FIA does not have the human resources to keep tabs on them, their numbers being so high.\"" <br />He also explains how economic downturn in Pakistan directly raises migration rates. \""Sialkot has become a huge exporter of illegal migrants after the manufacturing industry has regressed. Migration is not just a problem of policing borders, it\'s also a matter of internal conditions and policies.\"" <br />Usman states that an alarming number of students are being deported these days because of stricter visa re",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ulations in Europe and the United States. \""""There is no rehabilitation program for these deportees. We do not have the infrastructure to deal with them. They come back", have nothing to do and some of them turn to street crime," target killing or even terrorism.\""""<br />* * * *<br />When I visited the FIA Gujranwala office in January this year", the officials there had just arrested 14 intending migrants from a nearby railway station. Three entire families were trying to escape to Muscat.<br />They were all in detention. They had paid 250,000 rupees each to an immigration officer who provided them fake birth certificates, family registration forms, bank statements and forged travel documents. <br />Going to Muscat from Karachi was a popular route during the heyday of labour migration. The Gulf of Oman is still the conduit for a sizable amount of human trafficking. The agent named by the detainees, Naeem Sarwar, was picked up by the FIA officials in a raid at his house. Many visa stamps were found on the premises for South Korea, Bangkok, Indonesia, Iran, South Africa and even Libya. <br />The eastern routes take migrants to Sri Lanka or Bangkok and then onwards to Indonesia and Australia. Getting asylum in Australia is reportedly easier than in Europe. The FIA officers confirm that embattled religious minorities in Pakistan and political activists with genuine threats to their lives prefer to venture this way. <br />Sarwar, also under investigation for an earlier nomination in a human trafficking case, had an unexplained 36 million rupees in his bank account. The account, frozen on the FIA\'s request, was later made operational on a court order. Though the raid on his house had produced some documentary evidence, the court required witnesses too, and none were willing to testify. <br />These people still wanted to go abroad-and Sarwar was still their best bet.<br />* * * *<br />Khalid Anees, deputy director at the FIA Gujranwala office, is furiously shouting away orders at his subordinates. He is a busy man and does not have time to entertain queries from his staff, something that he establishes by continuously swearing at them. In between phone calls, he is interrogating one Akram Mughal who has been in the FIA\'s custody for a week. <br />Anees refers to him as ishtihaari mujrim-a proclaimed offender. The FIA put out his photo in local newspapers as a suspected felon and they found him during a raid on a travel agency after receiving an anonymous tip-off. He has been nominated in 26 complaints, all stating that he received hundreds of thousands of rupees, promising migration to as many as six different countries. <br />No witnesses came forward to testify against Mughal in the first four days of his detention. Then a woman, Amna Bibi, contacted Anees and offered herself as a witness. She told him that Mughal posed as a travel agent and took 140,000 rupees from her, promising her a visa to Dubai, but he never delivered on this promise. She claimed she still had a piece of paper signed by Mughal that was meant to act as a receipt, and that he had her passport in his possession. <br />Bald, with a creased forehead and grey stubble on his face, Mughal has the kind of constant cough that betrays a lifelong smoking habit. He asks sullenly for a cigarette, which he is promised after he is back in lockup. He is sitting on the wooden bench on one side of the deputy director\'s desk and is leaning against the wall, staring at the floor with sunken eyes, half mumbling his words. <br />Amna Bibi is sitting on the other end of the same bench. <br />While there is only one witness, all 26 complainants want their money back from Mughal. The FIA is struggling to comply. Mughal does not have much in his bank account. He will have to sell his house to return all the money.<br />With one ear on his telephone receiver, Anees dangles the carrot of cooperation in front of Mughal\'s eyes. His house does not need to be sold if he names his accomplices and tells the FIA where they are hiding. Mughal says he does not have any accomplices. <br />Anees is convinced that Mughal is a sub-agent for someone known as Mithoo whom he suspects of having fled to Muscat since Mughal\'s arrest," taking all the money with him. He calls Mughal crazy for not cooperating with the FIA. \""""He will ruin his own life but will not name others. What are we to do? There is no convincing these people.\""""<br />Mughal\'s reticence compels Anees to call in the next batch of complainants. A group of 10 burly men accuse one Ikram Butt from Shakargarh", Punjab," of absconding with 60 million rupees he received from them and many others for umrah visas. Anees shakes his head at them and asks if they ever bother to do background checks when giving money to agents. \""""Why do you just hand over money to anyone? Don\'t you watch news? Read newspapers? Thousands lose their money every year. Why doesn\'t anybody learn from other people\'s mistakes?\""""<br />Anees is going to have another long day at work. <br />* * * *<br />The FIA Quetta office is right in the eye of the immigration storm. Intending migrants from Punjab flood to Quetta before going onto Taftan where", the FIA estimates, 500 to 1000 people cross the border every day. A fair few of them are illegal trespassers. Some are stopped at the border but many filter through. <br />When I visited the circle office in January this year, 450 migrants had just been deported from Iran. A little while ago, this would have been a logistical catastrophe. The FIA\'s old detention centre in Quetta had space for 15-20 people. This is true for most FIA circles across Pakistan. <br />Now, though, the FIA has built a sizable detention centre at Taftan border. The deportees are being kept there, waiting for their appearance before a magistrate who also sits at Taftan now to avoid a huge backlog of cases. <br />After paying nominal fines, all these people will go back to Quetta, some to take trains home," others to turn around and head straight back to Taftan to make another attempt.<br />An FIA additional sub-inspector at the Quetta office tells me about the problems his department faces because of the sheer number of migrants that flow through here. \""""We get the same resources as any other FIA circle but our work burden is tenfold.\""""<br />He is a smart", energetic man," sporting a mustache and an air of congeniality. It is raining outside; he points to the weather and explains. \""""They are not cattle. They are human beings. They are citizens of Pakistan. The state in which we find them after they are sent back is often deplorable.\""""<br />He says the FIA should have much more power if the government is serious in putting an end to illegal migration. \""""We want to get to the smugglers", the traffickers," but all we are doing is dealing withthe deportees.\"""" <br />There are bad days and worse days when it comes to dealing with deportations. There are never any good days. \""""I\'ll give you a recent example","\"""" he pauses as he looks out the window. \""""A dead body came back from Iran a few months ago. The man had died inside a container. His body lay there for two days at the train station. Nobody came to claim it.\"""" <br />The dead can often go unclaimed. It takes time for news to get back to their families", if it ever does. Some do not even have identification documents with them. They have to be buried in unmarked graves in Quetta. <br />Workers at the local train station dread shrunken corpses that sometimes accompany the deported migrants.<br />* * * *<br />Turkey wants Pakistan to penalize both agents and illegal migrants, something it feels Pakistan has not been doing. Just before a fresh round of talks over a repatriation treaty between Ankara and Islamabad early last year, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said human traffickers defamed Pakistan abroad and took advantage of poverty stricken citizens. <br />He failed to realize that Turkey was not talking about human trafficking; it was talking about illegal migration. Even if human traffickers and illegal migrants largely end up using the same networks, they represent distinctly different phenomena. <br />Human trafficking victims are transported under coercion. Illegal migrants act out of their volition. Intending migrants are primarily male, from northern and central Punjab; whereas around 60 per cent of trafficking victims are women, from all over Pakistan, sold into forced prostitution or paper marriages. <br />Migrants get bullied and blackmailed too, but they retain some form of agency: to continue on or turn back. Trafficking is plain abduction.<br />The FIA, by all independent accounts, has in the recent past overcome one particularly brutal form of human trafficking: camel jockeys. Children under 14 years of age were sold to rich Arab camel racers in the Gulf to spur the animals on-without encumbering them under their own meager weight-during competitions. These children often received serious injuries. Many were left traumatized for life. Some even died.<br />According to the FIA\'s Red Book, the number of most-wanted Pakistani human traffickers was 141 in 2013, up from 95 in 2011. A majority of them belonged to Gujrat and Gujranwala districts of Punjab. <br />An overwhelming majority of people shown by the FIA as traffickers are, however, agents for illegal migrants. The top 20 human traffickers on the FIA Karachi\'s most-wanted list are all migration agents and fake visa consultants - most of them operating through the Mand-Bullo border between Iran and Pakistan," others using the route between Jiwani and Muscat. <br />The lack of distinction between people complicit in their own tragedies and those who are mercilessly exploited for profit has been one of the major hurdles in the implementation of the internationally accepted Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA). <br />\""""These people are arrested as human traffickers but the charges against them are mostly of document forgery and fraud","\"""" Anees tells me on the phone. They get bail", abscond," and their cases linger. \""""Often they go back to their consultancies and businesses.\"""" <br />He tells me about a recent raid against alleged human smugglers working at the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association. As the FIA officials reached the association\'s office", they met with a massive protest," launched against the FIA\'s own investigations. \""""Human smuggling is connected with so many other things. It is difficult to issue arrest and search warrants and to have a clear cut case that holds up in court. We need better laws","\"""" Anees says. <br />An even bigger problem is the involvement of government officials themselves. In 2014", Shahzad Gul, an FIA immigration official in Islamabad, was arrested along with a Pakistan International Airline (PIA) officer, Khurram Shahzad, for issuing boarding cards to three passengers later caught with visibly fake documents at London\'s Heathrow Airport. <br />In 2015, five officials of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) were arrested for issuing fake national identity cards to Afghan nationals. In May of this year, a Foreign Office director, Shafqat Ali Cheema, was arrested for owning assets whose worth is well above his declared sources of income. He was also accused of aiding human trafficking and smuggling. <br />A National Accountability Bureau (NAB) investigator says that Cheema was accused of facilitating human smuggling back in 2000 and was almost expelled from the Foreign Office but he managed to procure a restraining order from a court. He worked at Pakistan\'s embassy in Spain and was accused of passport fraud by the Spanish authorities. He allegedly faced similar charges when he got a subsequent posting in Korea.<br />Pakistan is planning to issue biometric passports from next year to halt the outflow of undocumented human beings. This follows an earlier effort to improve border monitoring through Computerised National Identity Cards (CNICs) and may turn out to be another futile exercise. As the case of recently slain Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour shows, owning a Pakistani CNIC for any Afghan is not a difficult thing. As long as illegal migrants and human smugglers are able to enlist the help of complicit government officials, chances of border trespassers being discovered with forged or illegally obtained biometric passports will not necessarily diminish. <br />* * * *<br />If migration is such a socioeconomic and political headache across the globe that these can impact the outcomes of elections-as London\'s mayoral and the United States\' presidential campaigns can attest-then why are international borders so open? Smuggled goods, smuggled armaments, exported ideologies and militancy-there are many problems associated with porous borders and yet the solutions never go beyond placing razor wires and erecting flimsy walls. <br />In a manner of speaking, the answers to this predicament are in the borders themselves. The imaginary lines that look arbitrary on a map become even more whimsical when you arrive at a border checkpoint, say the one between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The border in Chaman surreally divides families, houses and villages, making people from the same communities residents of two different countries. <br />There are laborers who work on one side of the fence and sleep on the other; some cross the border just to grab a cup of tea. <br />Their movement is regulated under the age old rahdari system. Under agreements in place since the time of the British Raj, local communities do not need federally approved travel documents or visas to commute across the border. They can travel on rahdari, a border pass, issued by local authorities. <br />This makes sense from a sociological point of view, but it causes problems in regulating cross-border movement. Thousands of Afghans cross over into Pakistan through the Chaman border under the rahdari system, before they attempt migration to Europe or Australia. <br />Passing through the Iran border is similarly easy, even though passports and visas come into play there. This is because of ziarat visas, meant for Shia pilgrims from Pakistan wanting to visit holy shrines in Iran. Thousands of non-Shias get this visa, often from the Iranian consulate in Quetta, to try and get to Turkey.<br />Complicated? It gets better.<br />On my first day in Jiwani, a town on the southwestern coastal edge of Balochistan and only 25 kilometers from the coast of Iran, I saw a boy sitting on beach stones next to the sea. He seemed to be waiting for someone, I assumed someone who had taken a boat out for fishing," but my assumption was a bit off the mark.<br />\""""I am waiting for my cousin","\"""" he explained.<br />Where was this cousin coming from?<br />\""""Iran.\""""<br />Iran?<br />\""""He goes there to study.\""""<br />Every day?<br />\""""Every day. His mother\'s family lives over there but he lives here with us. I am waiting for him to come back so we can go play football.\"""" <br />Jiwani was a high-traffic route to Iran before the Coast Guard set up a permanent outpost here. Local clinics and hospices talked about the injured and the dead that washed back ashore. They were running out of beds for the locals. <br />* * * *<br />In the FIA office in Gwadar", 20 men from northern Punjab sit huddled in the courtyard over a white sheet of cloth. The lockup where they ought to be is occupied by other, more serious offenders. These migrants will sleep out in the open tonight. They are being given dinner as I approach them, each sitting with his backpack in front of him and sneakers placed on one side. Their forlorn faces speak of regret-some for having tried to flee abroad, others for getting caught. <br />You can tell the first-timers from their terrified faces. The second and third-timers are calmer," they know they will be free in a few days.<br />The person I talk to first is barely 19 years old. He is from Sialkot. He is educated and he attempted to migrate with his father\'s help and permission. The agent offered him only the sea route. <br />He was told to take the Shalimar Express to Karachi and get to Yousuf Goth bus station. \""""I was to call the agent when I got there. When I did he told me to board a certain bus going to Gwadar. I saw many others like myself", phones in hand, bags on their backs," boarding the same bus so I figured that it was the right one.\""""<br />He remembers an uneventful journey into Balochistan before problems emerged. They were stopped at a checkpoint and uniformed personnel came on board for inspection. Intending migrants are not hard to spot"," especially when they are travelling in groups of over a dozen. \""""They asked for money",1,"500 per person. There was a man on the bus who negotiated with them.\""""<br />Before long"," it was late in the evening and the bus driver was getting agitated. \""""He said this wasn\'t supposed to happen. He had a short argument with the negotiator.\"""" Something in the negotiations was breaking down. Some of the migrants", including the young man from Sialkot, tried calling the agent but his number was switched off.<br />After a lengthy sojourn," the bus started moving again. The negotiator got off at the next stop. \""""I knew something was wrong; I was getting very tense. The agent called us one by one a little afterwards. He said there was a change of plans. We would have to get off the bus at a certain stop and walk to the shore where speed boats were waiting. Somebody would be there to show us the way.\""""<br />This is how most attempted migrations get foiled. The failure of one agent to pay another"," or the failure to negotiate with the relevant authorities. The boy from Sialkot was a nervous wreck by the time they made it to the coast. \""""When I first saw the sea rise and fall"," I felt dizzy. I had never seen the sea before. I did not even know how to swim.\""""<br />He wanted to turn back but his companions egged him on. Someone took his arm and settled him into a speedboat. He started praying more and more fervently as the motor started and the boat began its uneven movement. <br />\""""I thought I was going to be sick. I didn\'t notice when the lights started flashing at us.\""""<br />The Coast Guard intercepted their boat before the coast of Balochistan was out of sight. They arrested the intending migrants and handed them over to the FIA. <br />Drenched", defeated, scared," he had been sitting in the detention centre for a day now and had contacted his family back in Sialkot. \""""I just want to go home","\"""" he says.<br />The investigating officer of the FIA Gwadar circle begs to differ"," quite cynically. \""""He will be back. He has already paid the money.\"""" The officer\'s tone is harsh"," dismissive of the boy\'s plight. \""""I have seen hundreds like him; they are a little scared after the first time but the fear never lasts.\"""" <br />He takes me to the people making their second and third attempts. He starts interrogating them about the hows"," whys and where froms. \""""What did you do back in Mandi Bahauddin?\"""" he asks a 31-year-old man.<br />\""""I have some agricultural land and buffaloes. I am a farmer.\"""" <br />\""""So why do you want to go abroad. Here you have a home", a family, a living," self-respect. Why do you want to throw it all away to be a beggar in another land?\"""" The officer\'s tone gets harsher as he moves from one person to another.<br />\""""What about you?\"""" he addresses a younger man. <br />\""""I am a civil engineer.\""""<br />\""""Did you have a job here? A home? A decent life?\""""<br />\""""Yes","\"""" he replies.<br />\""""There it is","\"""" the officer looks at me"," shaking his head and smirking at the same time. \""""They are all well-fed"," living comfortably. They are just fools.\""""<br />He interrogates every person he passes by. College graduates", shop owners, clerks. There were only two seasonal laborers among the group and few of them were illiterate. It did not quite fit in with the classical narrative concerned with the economic migration of unskilled labour. <br />* * * *<br />There was a time before the world\'s migration migraine when crossing borders was not as tricky as it is today. <br />In the 1980s," Mudassir Nazir was an unemployed member of a lower middle class family in a village near Gujranwala. His father was a headmaster in a government school. One of his friends was an emerging bureaucrat in Lahore and was part of a trade delegation being sent by the government to the United Kingdom. <br />Nazir begged his friend to take him along. A large number of unwarranted aides and attaches accompanied the delegates.<br />The official trip ended in two weeks but Nazir never boarded the flight home. There was not much to come back to in his village. \""""I saw clean cities and beautiful women. I wanted to stay there and make a life","\"""" he tells me in December last year during one of his infrequent trips to Pakistan. He is a short", stout man with soft, pudgy hands. He is also an expert chef. <br />With nowhere to go in England and carrying little money, he set about finding some distant relatives who had legally migrated a few years before his arrival. He hid in their house for a few months, helping with domestic chores and cooking. He would eventually be hired as a store clerk by a Bangladeshi proprietor. He earned below minimum wage and slept behind the counter. <br />In a couple of years, he saved enough to open a small food stall of his own, with a little financial help from other established immigrants he had become friends with. He sent word back home through these friends that he was fine and in good health; when his family wrote back asking when he would come home, he could only offer silence.<br />Going back was not an option. Not in those first ten years. Such are the travails of living as an undocumented migrant. He would get into trouble at times; somebody he might have upset, somebody who didn\'t get along with him, or did not like the color of his skin would call the immigration authorities to inform on him; he was forced to move his establishment twice.<br />A decade after he had taken that flight to England, he saved enough money to open a desi cuisine restaurant in Manchester. It was a surprising hit with the locals. In time, his economic fortunes took a turn for the better. He got married to a British national, bought a house in her name," hired an immigration lawyer and started his naturalization process. <br />He could demonstrate good character and a history of paying taxes on his business. It still took another three years and some token palm greasing for his application to be approved. <br />\""""It was the happiest moment of my life. That constant fear of everything being taken away one day"," all of a sudden was finally gone.\""""<br />He came back to Gujranwala 13 years after he had left. He wore an expensive Marks & Spencers suit", put on gold cufflinks and a gold watch and rented a car from Lahore. It was more a coronation than a visit, an announcement of his newfound status.<br />The restaurant exists to this day and is reasonably popular but behind the exotic food it offers to what Nazir says are largely white and drunk patrons," there is a secret story of migration. \""""Over the course of my twenty years in the restaurant business", I have facilitated hundreds of migrants from Pakistan to Britain; young men from my village, from nearby villages. When I first got a cell phone, I used to get calls all day from people begging me to help their sons, brothers," fathers to get abroad.\""""<br />Nazir contributed to agent fees and provided the migrants shelter and refuge in his restaurant after their arrival in Manchester. He did not do so out of mere sympathy", though he insists sympathy was also a motivation. Undocumented migrants make a pliable work force; longer working hours, smaller wages," no place to complain and the threat of deportation always looming large. <br />\""""They used to sleep on wooden slabs above the pantry"," like I did when I first went there-half a dozen of them in a space small enough to be yours or mine bed.\"""" <br />Nazir has no qualms. \""""But what else was there? They couldn\'t be out in the public; they could hardly speak the language; they had nowhere else to go; they had no money. I was their only hope.\""""<br />He insists he did nothing wrong. \""""I did it to help them and to help myself. People say I did not pay them enough but I paid them more than what they would have earned elsewhere. More than they would have earned back home.\"""" <br />British authorities raid shops"," restaurants and general stores regularly for stowaways and undocumented people living in the United Kingdom. Nazir has had run-ins with law enforcement officials for hosting and employing illegal migrants. He has faced charges. His restaurant has been fined. And yet he takes everything in his stride. \""""These things happen. I wouldn\'t have made so much money on the back of a legal workforce. So you take these risks","\"""" he laughs. <br />Not everybody is as lucky as Nazir. A dozen people who waited tables at his eatery as well as two of his managers and one accountant were all deported back to Pakistan. Nazir lends them money now and again. Some of them are trying to make their way back into Europe; others are unsure how to continue their interrupted lives.<br />* * * *<br />Death", mutilation, humiliation, monetary loss and incarceration; the reasons never to attempt unlawful migration are many. On the other hand, the reasons to do so become more convoluted the more research is conducted. <br />The basic economic argument still holds much merit, the idea that even if nothing else changes, it is better to be a poor person in a rich country than a poor person in a poor country. <br />A large number of people who have genuine concerns for safety in their home countries often do not have the luxury of time to put together legal documents before going abroad to seek asylum. They flee in emergency, under duress. <br />There are Baloch nationalists escaping abductions and disappearances and targeted attacks. There are Pakhtuns escaping from the war-torn north. There are journalists and social activists escaping threats to their lives. There are people escaping family feuds and enmities. There are Christians, Ahmedis and Hazaras escaping religious and sectarian discrimination. <br />The Pakistani winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace is in self-exile as are many of the top intellectuals, politicians, activists, even religious leaders. <br />But beyond security and economic compulsions, academic research and popular depictions of migration increasingly suggest complex motives.<br />Ali Nobil Ahmad is a professor at the Lahore University of Management Science (Lums). He has written a book recently, Masculinity, Sexuality and Illegal Migration, arguing that the primary reason for migration might be rooted more in ideas of masculinity and sexuality than economy. <br />He interviewed dozens of migrants, both who had spent considerable amount of time abroad and those whose attempts had been aborted. His queries produced vague, uncertain replies," but always coming back to women and a liberal lifestyle. The major recurring theme was a sense of personal betterment out \""""there\""""-not economic betterment but independence", sexual freedoms, self-discovery and the conquest of the unknown.<br />Atther W. Qureshi, a Pakistani migrant now settled in Switzerland, is an educated migrant who went abroad to find adventure and a new life, to start form zero; to remake himself. He is a writer now, something he would never have been able to achieve here. A refugee in Switzerland, his semi-fictional account of landing in Switzerland, seeking asylum and sharing a refugee camp with other migrants is instructive as far as the migrant experience is concerned. <br />He describes the sense of calm that prevails in a refugee camp-an otherwise seemingly hopeless situation: cordoned off from the rest of the world," migrants wait patiently for their applications to be processed. It serves to illustrate how getting \""""there\"""" alone is half the achievement: being there and not being \""""here\""""-the \""""here\"""" they are trying to escape. <br />It seems a counterintuitive idea: willingly uprooting oneself from home", family, identity and culture; to take apart all these things and start all over again in an alien land, as an alien person. Adrift, anchorless.<br />But it is also a powerful one.<br />The 2012 film Zinda Bhaag is about the unrelenting appeal of this idea. It tells the story of three unhappy young men from Lahore, trying to migrate abroad. It shows them unable to find any outlet here for their energy and spirit. It shows them skirting the law with a gambling ring. It shows them making ambitious plans beyond what their social stations permit. It finally shows them paying for forged documents to travel abroad, the same forged documents that a friend of theirs used to try his luck, and died. <br />The last scene of this otherwise tongue in cheek film is a harrowing focus shot of one of the young men as he is asked whether he still wants his picture on his deceased friend\'s passport, knowing that he may meet the same fate. He stares straight into the camera," somber as if at a funeral-his own-and says yes. The film\'s title means \""""run away alive.\"""" a comment on what it means to migrate. <br />The film was a hit with local audiences who have seen these expressions on many young faces. This ambivalent attitude towards migration is a far cry from the migration experience shown in cinemas only a couple of decades ago. Dubai Chalo was a cinematic appropriation of the labour export mania. It advertised working class life in Dubai as this exotic", bountiful dream. The idea was to generate enthusiasm for labour exchange agreements signed by the Pakistani government at the time. <br />Such ideas, as we have now come to know, were far removed from reality. Pakistani laborers working in the Gulf live in appalling conditions, as second-class citizens, with barely any basic rights or social security. Their life is one of toil and turmoil and their only reward is to be able to send money home to their families. <br />But this erosion in the popular imagination of the good life abroad has not stemmed the tides of migration. In fact," migration has hit its highest rates ever. Part of the problem is confirmation bias. An intending migrant here in Pakistan only sees or hears of the success stories-fewer in number but with a disproportionate qualitative impact. <br />The message accompanying these stories is too inviting to be refused.<br />\""""Just get here and I\'ll take care of everything","\"""" was what Ismail\'s uncle said to him. The reasons to leave are plenty; the reasons to stay not quite so.<br />Names have been changed to protect the identities of the migrants.""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHKQ8sBUMVKlXs7B2IWjnicf5XsfA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=qFyYV7DdL8aBzAaE9pG4Cw&url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/perils-pakistani-migrants-heading-europe,EN,,27/07/2016 07:18,2016-07-26 17:32:16+00:00,d4f07714c5,Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting,,,,,1469561536,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
da7cb566fc,Peccaries Mourning Their Dead | National Geographic AU - National ... - National Geographic Australia,"Peccaries Mourning Their Dead | National Geographic AU<br />On January 8, 2017, an eight-year-old boy named Dante de Kort spotted a dead collared peccary near his home in central Arizona. For his school science fair project, he set up a motion-activated camera-a birthday present from his grandparents-next to the corpse.<br />Little did he know that his school project would offer an invaluable glimpse at how these animals respond to death.<br />At a regional science fair with her daughter in February, Prescott College biologist Mariana Altrichter[1] was immediately struck by de Kort\'s videos. Having studied the social, pig-like mammals for years, Altrichter knew how tightly bonded peccaries could be. But she\'d never witnessed herd members return to a body repeatedly. <br />\""It was pretty amazing because it wasn\'t just an immediate reaction and then they moved on-it went on for 10 days,\"" says Altrichter, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature\'s Peccary Specialist Group.[2]<br />DEALING WITH DEATH<br />Accounts of death rituals have been written for a variety of animals, including elephants, primates, dolphins, and birds such as ravens. Elephants, for instance, have been seen standing over a deceased herd member for days, rocking back and forth, and pulling the lifeless body in what some experts believe is an expression of grief. (Related: \""Whales Mourn Their Dead, Just Like Us[3].\"")<br />But no one had ever observed a death response in any of the three peccary species, which live throughout the Americas and tend to travel in herds of varying size.<br />In the videos, the peccaries pay close attention to the body, nuzzling, biting, sniffing, and staring at it. They slept next to the carcass, and even tried to lift it by wedging their snouts under the body and pushing upward.<br />And when a pack of coyotes approached their fallen peer, the herd chased them away. \""It really surprised me that they would stand up to the coyotes,\"" says de Kort, noting the peccaries were outnumbered. <br />On the tenth day, the coyotes finally demolished the rotting remains, and that\'s when the herd stopped visiting. De Kort and Altrichter described the series of intriguing events in a paper published December 5 in the journal Ethology.[4]<br />But was it mourning? It\'s hard to be certain based on the footage alone, although Altrichter is confident the behaviour meets the scientific definition: Actions that an animal takes to deal with a loss.<br />Whether feelings of grief accompanied those actions is unclear, she notes.<br />EMOTIONAL ANIMALS<br />Barbara J. King, an emeritus professor of Anthropology at the College of William and Mary and author of How Animals Grieve[5], objects to the distinction between mourning and grief.<br />She cites \""the solid, widespread evidence for emotional responses [to death] in surviving animals, ranging from depressed social withdrawal to evident distress in body posture and vocalisation.\""<br />Still, King acknowledges the possibility that the animals in the videos were neither grieving nor mourning. <br />In her opinion, the strongest evidence for grief was the act of sleeping beside the body-a behaviour that can\'t simply be chalked up to curiosity, territoriality, or other alternatives. It\'s quite plausible that peccaries would grieve, given the growing body of research detailing animals\' emotional responses to death, she adds.<br />Further research on peccaries could answer these lingering questions, and de Kort hopes to be part of it. <br />\""Most people think they\'re just animals,\"" says the fourth-grader, \""but they actually are pretty smart, and they have some human instincts too.\""<br />Erica Tennenhouse is a science journalist based in Toronto.

12e7d76697,Invisible women: \'I didn\'t know that bodies could look like that\' - The Guardian (blog),"Invisible women: \'I didn\'t know that bodies could look like that\' | Melanie Joosten | Society<br />\""They were one-metre square and they took up the three walls facing you, all these old women in the nude,\"" said Ella Dreyfus when I phoned her at her Sydney studio to ask about her work. It has been 15 years since Dreyfus presented her photographic exhibition Age and Consent, yet I haven\'t come across any Australian artist who has since produced such striking images of the ageing body.<br />\""There were 20 images, quite large, just of the women\'s torsos, so it was quite hard for viewers to deal with.\"" Feeling that headless bodies of women at any age might be confronting, I asked why she didn\'t include the women\'s faces. \""In photography, once you put a face in, it becomes a portrait of that person,\"" said Dreyfus, pointing out that the other two rooms of her exhibition included older people\'s faces. \""Whereas if just the torso is there, it can be seen in a different light. It can be seen in a broader cultural context.\"" <br />Related: Remember when the government cared about women working? | Kristina Keneally[1] <br />I thought of my least-favourite novel covers: the curve of a woman\'s back, always in a red dress, her head obscured or blurred in movement, or cut off completely. In these cases a woman is simply a cipher, a mannequin on which to hang the reader\'s imagination. She is only her body. Are Dreyfus\'s images not doing the same thing? Is it a sideways step to celebrate the older body by presenting it in the same way as young women\'s bodies have been seen for centuries? <br />\""Some say I\'ve objectified women\'s bodies,\"" said Dreyfus. \""And they can run with that argument. It\'s true, in a way.\"" But when considering her images, it is obvious that even if Dreyfus does objectify the women\'s bodies, her intention is not to degrade her photographic subjects or take anything away from them. Rather, the images are a quiet celebration of older women\'s bodies, refreshingly arresting depictions that both honour and discard the cliche of the female nude. Skin wrinkles and sags, bellies are marked with hysterectomy scars, breasts have a scattering of freckles. These bodies have been lived in and, in true portraiture style, they more than hint at the individual within. <br />How could I not have seen bodies such as this before?<br />In one image a woman lies in a classic centrefold pose, the picture cropped at the shoulders and the knees. Her hand rests in front of her pubic region; her breasts tilt to the bed; gravity draws the skin of her thigh to the mattress, hinting at a straight whisper of bone beneath. In the foreground, light glints from her wedding ring, her hands the most evidently aged part of her. Curiously, by not including any faces of her models in this series, Dreyfus has given the viewer nowhere to escape to - we must look at the body only, and what an unfamiliar sight it is. <br />While on the phone to Dreyfus, I found myself scrutinising the catalogue reproductions of the photographs, wondering at the way skin hangs loose, or gathers in neat furrows - I didn\'t know that bodies could look like that. How could I not have seen bodies such as this before? It\'s not repulsion that I felt, but not pure wonder either. My curiosity was tinged with something stronger: will this be me? <br />The Age and Consent exhibition was included as an official event of the 1999 International Year of Older Persons, and the Reverend Dorothy McRae-McMahon, one of the first female Uniting Church ministers in Australia, was a guest speaker at the opening. <br />\""She made the comment that mostly when you look at pictures of old people, it\'s of their faces or their hands,\"" said Dreyfus. \""It\'s really all we ever see of older people, whereas what I wanted to do was give an opportunity for viewers to look at other parts of the body that we\'re never allowed to see.\"" <br />My nana was one of my first, and therefore strongest, impressions of what being \""old\"" meant. Until I saw Dreyfus\'s photographs, I never considered what her body might have looked like - not her floured hands, her stockinged feet or familiar face, but her body. She and Pop lived on a dairy farm in Allansford, in Victoria\'s western district, and whenever we went to stay with them we would take daily visits to the freezing, pounding surf of Warrnambool\'s beach. <br />Nana and Pop only came once that I can recall: a Boxing Day outing where they sat in plastic webbed folding chairs, their shoes kicked off, Nana feeling the warmth of the sand through her stockings. I remember being fascinated by Nana\'s \""good shoes\"", the leather pushed out to accommodate her bunions, the shoes discarded as soon as she returned home; she was much more comfortable in her gumboots, tracksuit pants and a woollen beanie as she milked the cows each morning. I can see her feet beginning to take shape in my own - the outsized ball of my foot, the callouses that crowd my two big toes, winter\'s chilblains flaring red. <br />Sometimes, if we grandchildren caught Nana in a quiet moment - sitting in her chair knitting of an evening, perhaps, or kneading out the daily batch of scones to be baked in the wood oven - she would show us the sewing needle embedded in her finger, lying flat between two knuckles. \""How did it get in there, Nana? Doesn\'t it hurt?\"" We were fascinated. \""I can\'t remember,\"" she would reply, and we would wonder at living so long, at doing so many things, that you couldn\'t remember such a momentous occasion as a needle lodging itself in your finger. <br />Audiences at Dreyfus\'s exhibition filled the visitors\' book with comments on the women\'s courage in posing as they did. \""Beautiful, scary, amazing, thought-provoking,\"" were the impressions of one viewer, and the words \""confronting\"", \""brave\"", and \""challenging\"" pepper the entries, as do the words \""moving\"" and \""beautiful\"". <br />People seemed pleased by the opportunity to be provoked and to find beauty where it was not expected<br />Personal-care workers, nurses, occupational therapists, masseurs - there are many professionals who see naked bodies, and naked older bodies, on a daily basis. But for the rest of us it is such an unusual sight that we may feel uncomfortable and affronted. The bodies Dreyfus presented were not the buffed and polished figures we are used to seeing in fashion magazines and advertising, where male and female both are Photoshopped to hide blemishes such as stretch marks, cellulite, or scars - anything that might hint that the body has a use beyond the aesthetic. <br />The responses in the Age and Consent visitors\' book were overwhelmingly positive - people seemed pleased by the opportunity to be provoked and to find beauty where it was not expected. I was interested to know whether Dreyfus received any negative feedback. She told me that there had been a little in the media: a handful of letters to the editor in certain publications (a church magazine, for one), complaining about the articles promoting the exhibition and declaring the images inappropriate. <br />\""Most people don\'t leave a comment if they\'re feeling negative,\"" said Dreyfus. \""But there was one woman who told me her friend wouldn\'t come in - she\'d seen one of the images on the entrance stairs and refused to come any further. I asked her why not, and the friend said, \'She can\'t deal with her own ageing, she just doesn\'t want to see it.\'\"" <br />It was a strong reaction, but an honest and perhaps not uncommon one. An integral part of Dreyfus\'s practice is to spend time in the gallery during her exhibitions to see how people interact with her work. \""I\'ve noticed that an image on a gallery wall of someone\'s body can activate very strong feelings in the viewer - their response is reflected in their own body,\"" Dreyfus explained. \""These are ideas I\'m very interested in: the discomfort and shame people can feel about their own body.\"" <br />\""The women you photographed,\"" I asked Dreyfus, drawing my mind back to the topic at hand. \""Did they have difficulty with seeing their own body in the way you presented it?\"" <br />I was thinking of one of the images in particular, cropped from waist to knee: a woman holding her walking stick firm at her hip, the skin of her legs draped like curtains drawn to reveal her genitals. I was also thinking of the time I had my skin checked for melanoma. As someone who burns within 10 minutes of being in the sun, skin cancer has always seemed for me a question of when rather than if. <br />I\'d found a service that created a personal mole map - every inch of your body is photographed every 12 months, the results compared to identify moles and freckles that have grown or proliferated. I didn\'t mind the process, standing there bra-less and in my knickers, arms aloft and turning from side to side as a nurse snapped away with her digital camera. But when she uploaded the images to catalogue them and flag any suspicious-looking moles, I was dismayed by just how unattractive I appeared on the monitor. At the end of the session, perhaps sensing my discomfort, the nurse gave me a copy of the images on DVD and a polite warning to keep them somewhere safe. I doubted anyone would be much interested in those particularly unflattering images, but it made me wonder, how would I feel if nude photographs of my own ordinariness were exhibited in public? <br />\""They were all women I knew - family and friends,\"" Dreyfus told me. \""Some of them came with their families to the opening night and were really thrilled. They were quite proud; there was a celebratory feeling. Others didn\'t come at all, for mobility reasons or because they clearly didn\'t want to see it. <br />\""One of the models was my great-aunty Carol, and an image showing her saggy breasts and open-heart-surgery scars was used on a news report to promote the show - she was really upset when she saw it on prime-time television. I felt terrible, and I asked her why she was so upset and she said, \'Because it reminded me of the pain that I\'ve been through in my body and all the operations I\'ve had.\' It wasn\'t the response I expected. I thought she was going to get cross with me, but she didn\'t at all, she didn\'t mind that all these strangers saw a photograph of her naked body.\""<br />\""Were you surprised at how strong her reaction was?\"" I asked. \""I was, but I could understand it. My first model was my nana. It took me years to convince her: I just applied subtle pressure every now and again.\"" Dreyfus laughed at the memory of her own insistence. \""But when I processed the film and made the contact sheets of her images, I cried. And I put them away for a whole year; I didn\'t look at them again. When it came to making some small prints in the darkroom, I was weeping over the chemicals because I was so close to her and I found the pictures ... \"" She hesitated. \""Well, it was the vulnerability in the ageing body. It was too much for me, and I broke down.\"" <br />While Dreyfus\'s exhibition largely focused on the bodies of older women, the impetus for the project was a commission to create artwork for the aged-care unit of Liverpool hospital in Sydney. In the catalogue accompanying Age and Consent, Dreyfus described how the hospital was disappointed with her initial work, finding it too challenging to display: \""There was an aversion to pictures that depicted illness and mortality, and an unwritten code that demanded I represent an institutionally sanctioned portrayal of the dignity and benignity of old age.\"" <br />Related: Why do some of us, like David Attenborough, live to 90? It\'s not luck | Alan Walker[2] <br />While she fulfilled her brief to the hospital, she decided to exhibit her rejected photographs, alongside enlarged images of the patients\' signatures. In one picture, a woman brings her hands to her eyes. Her jumper is pilled; a flash of light is the glimpse of her wedding ring, blurred by her hand\'s movement. Is she crying? Is she playing a child\'s game of hide and seek? Blocking out a world she doesn\'t want to see? In another, a man with his back to the viewer is bent forward in his chair. Striped pyjamas are peeping through the opening of his hospital gown. The stamp of the hospital is on the gown shoulder, reminding us that it will be laundered and worn again, by someone else. A patient care assistant carries a woman in his arms, his ID card clipped to his polo shirt, an ID bracelet around her ankle. The ruffle of her nightdress, her glasses large on her face. He holds her firmly, with confidence, and she holds herself the same way. <br />The signatures of the sitters were an integral part of the exhibition, leading the viewer to ask: when it comes to ageing, what have any of these people consented to? What have we consented to? Some mornings, if I drag myself out of bed early enough, I go swimming before work. And there\'s always one particular woman there at that hour, every morning, no matter the weather. She hangs her clothes in the changing rooms, leaves her walking stick on a bench, and walks to the outdoor pool and swims lap after lap. <br />I don\'t know how old she is, and it feels rude to ask. Which is a shame, because there are so many things I want to know, beginning with what it is like to be her age. A ridiculous question, I know: her age is probably more conspicuous to me than it is to her. She\'s in her 70s, I guess, or maybe 80s. And it strikes me that my nana died at 74 - an age that at the time seemed ancient in my childish comprehension, but sounds much too young to me now. <br />Among so many other things, I wish I had thought to ask her whether she liked to swim. And how did that needle really end up there, Nana, sitting so snugly between your knuckles?<br />This is an edited extract from Melanie Joosten\'s book A Long Time Coming: Essays on old age, published by Scribe and available from 30 May 2016.

12d972b69c,Take up beekeeping - So Md News (subscription),"Take up beekeeping | Outdoors<br />The winter blues have hit Southern Maryland.January and February always seem like the longest months of the year. The weather is dreary and cold. The sun itself is on vacation, and we\'re left waiting for its return. And nothing is worse this time of year than getting a cold.Do you load up on Vitamin C or try one of the medicinal options at the drugstore? Or maybe you follow the advice of an age-old proverb that advises a person to \""starve a fever and feed a cold.\""My favorite remedy is pretty simple - a cup of hot tea with lemon and honey. The heat and lemon help open the nasal passages, while the syrupy honey coats the throat. It doesn\'t cost much and provides relief.But I\'m not referencing the kind of honey you buy in a plastic bear off the shelf at the grocery store. No, I\'m talking about the good stuff that comes straight from the honeycomb, golden and flavorful, honey in the raw, the way Mother Nature intended it to be.Lucky for me, my sister has her own farm where she tends chickens, goats and - you guessed it - bees. She sends me two pints of the best honey every fall after she harvests her hives. I have to keep the jars on a high shelf in the kitchen, otherwise the kids eat it by the spoonful and it\'s gone before I even get a chance to enjoy it.You might be interested in beekeeping and this is the time of year to start getting ready. It might feel like January is a bit early to be planning and preparing, but the next few weeks are crucial for anyone who wants to get into beekeeping this spring.Maybe you want your own bees because of the recent news that honeybee populations are declining. Almost 90 percent of flowering plants depend on animals for pollination, with bees accounting for a big portion of that.If you grow your own fruits and veggies, having a beehive nearby will increase your garden\'s yield. How many times have you had to fertilize squash by hand or risk having another fruit wither on the vine because it wasn\'t fertilized? That won\'t happen if you have your own crew of bees visiting all the flowers in your garden.And if you want a hobby that will provide endless fascination, beekeeping will never get dull. Having 60,000 of these industrious insects in your own backyard will help you become a master of observation. You\'ll watch and learn about the different jobs bees have in the hive.We\'ve all heard the phrases worker bees and queen bee. With your own hive you\'ll be able to get firsthand knowledge of why bees get those titles. And you\'ll get more attuned to the world you are living in, paying attention to the cycle of the seasons, what\'s blooming and when and how much rain we\'ve had.I should put in a disclaimer here too that bees are not generally aggressive and do not normally sting unless provoked to the point that their lives are in danger or they think the hive is being attacked. Wasps, which are often confused with bees, are much more aggressive and likely to bite or sting. That said, anyone who keeps bees will get stung on occasion.Of course, getting honey straight from the comb is a good reason, too, although keep in mind you usually won\'t get enough production the first year of beekeeping to harvest any honey.And did you know that honey tastes vary depending on the region and time of year? Honey harvested earlier in the season is lighter and more delicate-flavored while later season honey is darker and has a stronger flavor. And of course the taste depends on what the bees have been visiting, which is strongly regionalized. Don\'t forget other products such as beeswax candles, certain lip balms, and beeswax furniture polish wouldn\'t be possible without bees.The upfront costs for beekeeping are significant when starting from scratch. The monetary commitment is around $500, but if you\'re pretty handy, you could possibly build your own hive and save a bit.You\'ll need at least one hive, and some experienced beekeepers recommend starting out with a second one, which adds a little to the bottom line. Just the bees alone have a hefty price tag of about $100 or more for a start-up colony.<br />There are a couple different kinds of beehives to choose from, each with their own pros and cons, and you\'ll have to decide which kind to use and where to install it on your property.You\'ll need to purchase basic tools like a smoker and bee suit. And then comes the fun part, you\'ll have to decide what kind of bees to order, and you\'ll need to do that soon because they sell out fast.There are two options, buying a nucleus, or nuc, or getting a package of bees. If you don\'t know the difference and which to buy (hint: a nuc only fits a Langstroth hive), taking a class and talking to experienced beekeepers will help you decide.While there are plenty of books about beginning beekeeping available nowadays, beekeeping is complicated. That\'s why it\'s a good idea to take a beekeeping class to help you make decisions and connect you with a whole wealth of information from local beekeepers who have experience keeping bees.In our area, the Association of Southern Maryland Beekeepers is holding a beginner\'s beekeeping course in February at the Calvert County Sportsman\'s Club in Prince Frederick.The class will meet from 9 a.m. to noon Feb. 11, 18, and 25. The cost, which includes a textbook, is $40 per person or $45 for a couple who shares a book.The class fills quickly, so if you are interested, contact Cheryl at cckenney.md@gmail.com[1] for enrollment information and to see if seats are still available.<br />References^ cckenney.md@gmail.com (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHCGubJLg7IDBPYcqRiA_vybpb_Lg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779350617386&ei=hhZ_WODrJYq3W6Wrp-AF&url=http://www.somdnews.com/independent/sports/outdoors/take-up-beekeeping/article_c07106ce-3da7-5d8a-a2db-00e42f17ef30.html,EN,,18/01/2017 08:02,2017-01-18 03:34:03+00:00,2149121cdb,So Md News (subscription),,,,,1484714043,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
daae5698b8,Map of your arteries so surgeons can spot danger blockages to stop amputation - Daily Mail,"Map of your arteries so surgeons can spot danger blockages to stop amputation<br />A \'road map\' that gives a detailed image of blood flowing through the legs could help patients at risk of amputation.The scan has been studied in patients with critical limb ischaemia (CLI), which occurs when blockages in the blood vessels to the legs are so severe they cause irreversible damage to the skin and muscle.This occurs as a result of peripheral arterial disease, when the arteries carrying blood from the heart to the legs become narrowed with a build-up of fatty deposits. These scans do not give any information about the amount of blood flowing in the arteriesThis affects one million people in Britain. Left unchecked, the arteries become increasingly furred up until insufficient blood supply causes permanent damage to the legs.Over weeks or months, reduced blood flow and oxygen supply cause ulcers and the skin turns blue/black in colour, indicating that critical limb ischaemia has set in. Typically, it\'s the foot that\'s affected.Currently, patients are given CT or MRI scans to identify the location of any blockages in the arteries.However, these scans do not give any information about the amount of blood flowing in the arteries or about the smaller blood vessels that supply the leg.If a blockage is found in a scan, a surgeon can operate to improve the blood flow by surgically bypassing the blocked artery or performing an angioplasty - where a wire mesh tube (a stent) is inserted to hold it open.But the surgeon can only tell if blood flow has been sufficiently restored by observing the effect on the patient\'s leg afterwards - whether the pain or ulcers are disappearing or the normal skin colour is returning. Tells doctors exactly how much blood flow there is throughout the leg This process can take weeks, by which time it is often too late to operate again and save the limb.However, the new technique, which has been developed at Guy\'s and St Thomas\' NHS Foundation Trust in London, tells doctors exactly how much blood flow there is throughout the leg and gives a detailed overview of every blood vessel\'s function.A recent study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, showed the new scan was able to accurately measure the amount of blood moving through leg muscle, and a British trial is planned within 12 months.The procedure, known as a BOLD-CMR, is a two-part scan - one before surgery to remove the blockage and one immediately after. The two images are then used by the surgeon to determine how much the blood flow has changed using a special formula - they get an instant result on a screen that tells them if the surgery has worked.This means that patients will no longer have to stay in hospital for weeks waiting for the results, and doctors can operate again much sooner if needed, thereby saving limbs from a risk of amputation if there is still a blockage.In the latest study, overseen by vascular surgeon Bijan Modarai, researchers showed the mapping technique could accurately measure how much blood was reaching the muscles in the legs of 34 people with CLI, before and after treatment, and in 22 healthy people.Now, an additional clinical trial is planned within 12 months to test its accuracy more vigorously in critical limb ischaemia.\'Being able to measure the flow of blood more accurately would be a step forward from the standard imaging we do at present,\' says Kevin Varty, a vascular consultant at Addenbrooke\'s Hospital in Cambridge.Meanwhile, drinking beetroot juice could help to improve blood flow.In a new trial at Wake Forest School of Medicine in the U.S., 24 patients with peripheral arterial disease will be given the juice or a placebo drink, twice a day for a week, and researchers will assess the effects on symptoms.The trial follows research showing that compounds called nitrates in the vegetable can dilate vessels and lower blood pressure.The researchers believe beetroot juice will boost blood flow and oxygen supply to the legs. ",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEa5m-s7ElwOXSOvbv-HvbSS6ZZdQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=ENI6V6HmEuONzAaJ46qYDA&url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3459279/Map-arteries-surgeons-spot-danger-blockages.html,EN,,17/05/2016 08:14,2016-02-22 23:35:21+00:00,15125d9a6f,Daily Mail,,,,,1456187721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dabd2e69fb,Proper diet reduces risk of lame cows - Grainews,"Proper diet reduces risk of lame cows<br />Recently, I conducted a barn walk in a 300-cow robot-milking dairy and within 10 minutes I spotted more than a half-dozen limping cows. I did not know what caused them to limp, but after I talked to the dairy manager, I discovered that lameness was a significant problem on his operation and several of these cows showed up as \""alarms\"" because they were not visiting the milking stations as programmed.<br />In this particular operation, I recommended he should identity lame cows immediately as well as set up an aggressive prevention program. That\'s because lameness in dairy cattle, whether it appears in a robot-milking barn or any other milking system is always an obstacle to good milk and other dairy performance.<br />I believe solving and preventing common lameness starts with the observation of the first limping cow. When a cow is seen limping, the producer should take the time to observe her general behavior to get some idea of why she is limping before proceeding with corrective action.<br />Leading causes<br />One of the leading causes of lameness in dairy cattle is common physical injury. Direct injury takes on different forms such as punctures, ulcers, abscesses, or deep cuts to the horn and sole. When the hoof is damaged, a protective barrier against hoof disease is broken, in which anaerobic (lives without oxygen) bacteria such as Fusobacterium necrophorum, (foot rot), strep and staph organisms are allowed to enter and thrive. Similarly, anaerobic pathogens such as Treponema strains commonly known as \""hairy heel warts\"" can also cause inflammation and painful lesions to the interdigital skin of the hoof.<br />Another leading cause of lameness in dairy cattle is laminitis, which is the inflammation of \""living\"" laminar corium tissues within the hard hoof. It often leads to abnormal horn growth and wear, which makes walking difficult and is very painful for the animal. Such laminitis is classified upon severity into three main areas, namely: acute, sub-acute and chronic laminitis.<br />Acute laminitis is the most visible. It is the severe lameness that we frequently associate with cattle limping up to the feed bunk. For example, sole abscesses can result from cracks or holes originating from laminar corium damage in the hoof sole. This damage allows foreign material to enter the hoof and an abscess may form due to infection. White line disease can be another form of acute laminitis in which hemorrhages and poo- quality horn formation along the sole white line lets foreign bodies such as grit and sand to manifest itself into severe lameness.<br />During sub-acute laminitis, the clinical signs of typical laminitis are often visible. This form of lameness is a degeneration of the laminar corium of the hoof which leads to increased hoof wear and greater hoof injury. Sole ulcers are associated with sub-acute laminitis, which is a loss of horn sole and unhealthy exposure of the laminar corium.<br />Lastly, I view chronic laminitis as an extension of sub-acute laminitis by which hoof damage has become irreversible. Permanent damage to the laminar corium allows complete separation of bone from the horn wall. These dairy cattle have very broad hooves with the classic ridges (associated with high-grain diets). Hoof growth is altered so extensively the cow may walk on her heels rather than normally on her toes.<br />Feeding program is #1<br />The lactation feeding program has one of the biggest impacts on the cause and prevention of laminitis in milking dairy cattle. Feeding high-grain diets, low-forage diets or finely chopped forages can lead to sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA), a major cause of laminitis. SARA has also been implicated in greater rates of hoof wear, greater risk of physical hoof injury and thus increased potential for viral or bacterial invasion within the hoof.<br />As a ruminant nutritionist, I balance dairy diets by meeting the nutrient requirements of lactation, while preventing SARA at the same time. This means pH levels in the rumen are maintained above 5.5-6.0 by limiting the amount of non-fibre carbohydrates (NFC) originating from starch enriched grains digested by the cows, and also by feeding enough effective forage fibre that promotes good rumen fermentation and acid-buffering capacity. I target dietary NFC levels between 33 to 38 per cent, while assuring a minimum of 28 per cent dietary neutral detergent fibre (NDF) is fed and with 3/4 of this NDF coming from forages.<br />With such amounts of limited grain, and adequate forage going into the dairy mixer wagon, I often employ other nutrients that help strengthen hoof hardiness that has been scientifically shown to prevent invading foot-disease.<br />For example, I instructed a dairy producer a few years ago to add four grams per head per day of zinc methionine to his lactation dairy premix, which in turn was added to his daily milking TMR. After seven months of zinc addition, a successful reduction in lameness was observed and recorded. Even the hoof-trimmer made the comment - the general hardness of the hooves in the cow herd improved.<br />Cleanliness is key<br />Aside from these nutritional preventative measures to combat lameness, I am also a big advocate in improving barn sanitation.<br />A dairy producer operating a 150-cow dairy near Edmonton with three robot stations takes a big firehose, every morning and washes the concrete pad and metal grate under each milking station. I also know he worked with his veterinarian to set up the proper number of footbaths and protocols in his barn. As a result, I find the feet of his cows cleaner than most milking cows from my other barn visits and his farm has experienced a low incidence of \'alarm\' cows due to lameness.<br />I guess that my friend figures that when it comes to healthy hooves, dairy cattle need all the help they can get. I can also help him and other dairy producers by setting up the proper dairy diets that keep lactation cows stand on their feed, eat lots of feed and produce lots of milk. <br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFpyzOZvgNlXGfF4MyBYzwWT-5SXg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=fsvGVvi5M5_Va8rLj4gG&url=http://www.grainews.ca/2016/02/17/proper-diet-reduces-risk-of-lame-cows/,EN,,19/02/2016 08:00,2016-02-17 19:47:57+00:00,09f6823154,Grainews,,,,,1455742077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
db1d6ba67b,Carthage teen looks forward in style after a cancer scare - Joplin Globe,"Carthage teen looks forward in style after a cancer scare | Lifestyles: Entertainment, Life and more<br />CARTHAGE, Mo. - \""I\'ve started to hate Miami,\"" says Noah Elliott, before changing tack with his next sentence and returning himself to 15-year-old normalcy. \""Of course, I like the beaches, and the girls are cute.\""Miami is where, this past August, Noah fought and won his second bout with ocular melanoma, a form of eye cancer. Since his diagnosis at the age of 7, and throughout this year\'s struggle with the disease, Noah has used his sense of humor and stoicism to overcome a host of medical challenges. When his vision declined in his right eye, a consequence of the first round of treatment, he could no longer play organized sports or march in the Carthage High School band. <br />Now, with his illness under control, Noah plays in the pep band - his instrument is the alto sax - and works crew for the marching band.He is thinking of becoming a music teacher. He took up weightlifting, too, and says he has begun to scare people because, \""I\'m really light, and I lift a lot.\""\""People who have followed his story have been absolutely amazed at how he\'s handled things,\"" said Stephanie Elliott, Noah\'s mother, \""and I couldn\'t be more proud.\""In an irony that befits Noah\'s lemons-to-lemonade spirit, Miami is also the port of call for the Elliott family\'s favorite cruise lines.After Noah\'s eye specialist moved from St. Louis to Miami during his seven-year remission, his family was able to get two things done at once during their visits to Miami: checkups and vacations. The two completely different tasks didn\'t really impact each other until a doctor\'s visit in January revealed a second growth in Noah\'s right eye. The Elliotts had already booked a weeklong cruise that was set to depart from Miami the next day. So off they went.Noah insisted there was absolutely no reason to waste a cruise.\""I kind of forgot about it,\"" he said. \""I wasn\'t going to let me bum everybody out.\""He spent the week hanging around on rope courses before returning to the mainland for a round of radiation therapy. For eye cancer patients, this involves holding radioactive material on the surface of the eye using a cup-shaped strip of gold.<br />Noah was forced to sit still through four days of treatment, unable to even move his eyes inside his head.It had worked before, however - giving him that seven-year remission. And it succeeded this time, as well - breaking down the tumor. But as the tumor disintegrated, pieces were still left in its wake.Traveling to Miami in August, the family faced a choice: attempt to clean out the debris left behind by the radiation treatment or remove the eye entirely from the socket.Noah himself made the call.<br />\""I just remember seeing my dad start tearing up for the second time in my life,\"" he said. \""I\'m like, \'Let\'s just get rid of this thing.\' It\'s causing way too much pain for me and my family.\""Noah\'s bout with cancer is one for the record books. First, Noah was only the second patient that his specialist has seen who developed a second tumor in the same eye. And second, at 7 years old, he was the youngest patient his doctor had even seen with the disease.The hospital that removed Noah\'s eye held on to the troublesome orb for further study. His doctor is planning to write up the case as part of a medical study.For his part, Noah isn\'t terribly concerned with being a \""John Doe\"" in that study.\""They\'re poking it right now with something,\"" he said, imagining the far-off laboratory. \""I hope (it\'s) with a cattle prod. My friends joke that it\'s in Area 51.\"" He\'s looking forward to its replacement, a glass orb that brings with it a host of exciting stylistic possibilities.\""He wanted a black eye, he wanted a gold eye, he wanted different colors in one eye,\"" his mother said. She then, turned to her son and made him an offer right there on the spot. \""I will buy you the matching set. You can get the funky color on your own.\""Noah and his friends plan to dress as pirates for Halloween this year. His new eye - perhaps a pearly white one, like an opal - will play a starring role.And he\'s already dreaming up ideas for next year\'s Halloween. He\'ll have his driver\'s license by then, and he says learning to drive with one eye has made him a better and more careful driver. By then, the novelty of the glass eye and the challenges of this past summer will be in the rearview mirror.\""I\'ve always talked about what kind of room I would make in a haunted house,\"" he said. \""I want to put a fog machine on the ground, and then bars on the ceiling that I can climb around on. And then I\'d put in a strobe light so one second you see nothing but smoke and then the next I\'m just there.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGh3vrZlcHmuBqgKTh-2c-ZwZ4XGg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=dcLoV7C_OcGlWPSKq9AM&url=http://www.joplinglobe.com/news/lifestyles/carthage-teen-looks-forward-in-style-after-a-cancer-scare/article_3c5984f7-1ff4-55e3-9fb1-5d5744b1e7b1.html,EN,,26/09/2016 07:04,2016-09-25 10:05:38+00:00,51fe179e08,Joplin Globe,,,,,1474805138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also known as javelinas or skunk pigs, they resemble pigs and wild boar[2]. However, the two actually belong to different, albeit closely related, families. Peccaries are social animals and often live in groups.<br />In January, 8-year-old Dante de Kort was watching a herd of five collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu[3]) behind his house in Arizona. One of them seemed to be ill.

db29ead288,Why Saturday Night Live Shook Things Up - The Atlantic,"Why Lorne Michaels Fired Taran Killam, Jay Pharoah, and Jon Rudnitsky From \'Saturday Night Live\'<br />Saturday Night Live has had roughly the same cast for the last three seasons; in the typical arc of the long-running series, this is when the series would be hitting its stride. Over its 41 seasons on the air, SNL has had peaks and valleys, but each new cast usually comes into its own after a couple of years building experience. This time around, that hasn\'t happened[1]. Perhaps as a result, the show announced Tuesday that it wasn\'t picking up the contracts of three cast members[2], a shakeup that suggests things aren\'t quite right at 30 Rockefeller Center.<br />Related Story<br />Where Saturday Night Live Failed This Season[3]<br />Taran Killam, Jay Pharoah, and Jon Rudnitsky certainly aren\'t the first cast members to be summarily let go by SNL\'s honcho, Lorne Michaels. For most of its tenure, Saturday Night Live was known for the ruthlessness of its reorganizations. But it has also enjoyed a near-unprecedented run of good fortune over the last decade: The transition from the late-\'90s cast led by Will Ferrell, Molly Shannon, and Jimmy Fallon to the mid-aughts ensemble fronted by Kristen Wiig, Andy Samberg, and Bill Hader was fairly seamless. The show\'s reputation for its hostile cliques changed considerably during this time, but, as the current firings suggest, the lightened mood only lasts as long as the sketches are funny. If history is any indicator, there\'s a chance that SNL\'s shakeup may not have been brutal enough.In 1995, perhaps responding to a slew of negative reviews, including a New York Magazine cover story about the show\'s \""decline and fall[4]\"", Michaels fired some of SNL\'s biggest stars, including Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, and Kevin Nealon. Even though he went on to A-list movie stardom, Sandler seems bitter about the manner of his departure to this day[5]. (\""Who knows?\"" he told The Daily Beast in 2014 when asked why he was fired.) In 2006, Michaels offloaded much of the show\'s cast[6] in the wake of the head writer Tina Fey\'s departure, paving the way for younger stars like Samberg, Hader, and Wiig to get more airtime and make the show their own.These purges were often exactly what the show needed, letting SNL reinvent itself every few years. In 2012, another turnover began. Over 2012 and 2013, Wiig, Samberg, Hader, Fred Armisen, and Jason Sudeikis all left the show, while repertory players like Killam and Pharoah were hailed as its new backbone. Pharoah, a master impressionist who plays everyone from President Obama to Kanye West, hasn\'t commented on his firing, but Killam sounded genuinely hurt in an interview[7] with Uproxx.<br />I was there for six years. I have not been anywhere in my life for six years. I don\'t know that the end of something that you\'ve committed that much time and energy to is ever going to feel \""great\"" ... You sign for seven years, so I had one more year. I had sort of had it in my head I would make this upcoming year my last year, but then heard they weren\'t going to pick up my contract. I was never given a reason why, really. I can assume until the cows come home.<br />Killam played one of the current cast\'s few memorable recurring characters-the snooty 1860s critic Jebidiah Atkinson[8]-and had a repertoire of impressions that included Brad Pitt, Matthew McConaughey, and Christoph Waltz. The 2011 debut of his Eminem impression[9], alongside Pharoah as Lil Wayne, was a remarkable breakout moment for the actor, and an apt metaphor for the arc of a performer on the show. Killam had been mostly backgrounded in his first season on the show; but suddenly he came alive, to raucous cheers from the audience, and his stardom was cemented.Still, he never quite became the leading man SNL was clearly looking for. The early creative promise of his sketches, like the audacious \""Jeunes de Paris[10],\"" performed (and written by Killam) entirely in French, leveled off. He was given big assignments like providing the show\'s Donald Trump impression; just as quickly, he was replaced, with Michaels bringing back former cast member Darrell Hammond (famed for his work as politicians like Bill Clinton and John McCain) to do the job instead. As is disappointingly common on SNL, the show has a bit of a white-guy logjam to solve-Michaels may have thought that newer performers like Beck Bennett and Pete Davidson needed more room to develop.Pharoah was hired strictly as an impressionist, but came into his own as a sketch performer, devising recurring characters like the wheezing high school Principal Frye[11]. With Obama soon to be out of office, one of Pharoah\'s most crucial roles would have been diminished; nonetheless, it\'s a step backward for the cast\'s diversity, unless SNL is looking to add new performers of color. Rudnitsky, a stand-up comedian, was added to the cast last year but never distinguished himself as a sketch performer, and was dogged by early controversy[12] over tasteless old jokes on his Twitter feed.SNL could need a more drastic revamping if it wants to see results.All of which raises the possibility that the show didn\'t go far enough with its overhaul. SNL was noticeably rusty last season, with its brightest spot involving a guest star, Larry David, playing Bernie Sanders. The show failed[13] to capitalize on the charged Republican primaries and the rise of Trump, delivering softball political humor and drawing criticism[14] for having the GOP candidate host an episode, seemingly lending him free publicity in a cheap ratings grab. A slightly slimmer cast could lead to more opportunities for its younger players, but SNL could need a more drastic revamping if it wants to see real results.The show has one undisputed star-Kate McKinnon, who has been around for four seasons and is already turning heads on the big screen. Her Ghostbusters co-star Leslie Jones also feels primed for a breakout, and has earned the love of SNL\'s parent network NBC for her passionate Olympics coverage on Twitter[15] (so much so that she\'s going to Rio to help cover the second half of the Games). Aside from that, the show\'s cast are mostly reliable utility players who\'ve had a few years to prove themselves, and have struggled to attract wider attention. SNL\'s Weekend Update anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che are still trying to figure out their chemistry, while the digital shorts made by Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett haven\'t drawn the viral appeal or online audience Andy Samberg enjoyed a decade ago.The stakes for season 42, then, are pretty high. In 2008, as the Obama/McCain election hit fever pitch, the show struck ratings gold and re-entered the national conversation; the fall of 2016 will be similarly potent. \""I think of change as just being part of the show. It has to be renewed every year, and you have to be building for the future,\"" Michaels said in an interview[16] with Indiewire this June. \""This is the first election in my lifetime where I can\'t tell you where it\'s going. For me, to be able to have a voice in it is important.\"" Perhaps this shakeup comes from Michaels being dissatisfied with SNL\'s voice so far. The recalibration could end up being what the cast needed-or it could be a portent of bigger changes to come.References^ that hasn\'t happened (www.theatlantic.com)^ three cast members (www.nytimes.com)^ Where Saturday Night Live Failed This Season (news.google.com)^ decline and fall (nymag.com)^ to this day (www.vanityfair.com)^ offloaded much of the show\'s cast (variety.com)^ in an interview (uproxx.com)^ Jebidiah Atkinson (www.nbc.com)^ debut of his Eminem impression (www.nbc.com)^ Jeunes de Paris (www.slate.com)^ Principal Frye (www.nbc.com)^ dogged by early controversy (www.theatlantic.com)^ The show failed (www.theatlantic.com)^ drawing criticism (www.nbcnews.com)^ passionate Olympics coverage on Twitter (www.usatoday.com)^ an interview (www.indiewire.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFY80oPu8DzpQIspfFRW-PbmNtWpQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779176685115&ei=D9CqV9D6BribzAaPqY7ABQ&url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/08/why-saturday-night-live-shook-things-up/495104/,EN,,10/08/2016 07:13,2016-08-09 16:02:07+00:00,e0a6a790e1,The Atlantic,,,,,1470765727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though the water level had been constantly rising for days, slowly but steadily, she did not anticipate that, by Saturday evening, her semi-pucca hut would get submerged in the swelling Ganga.\'Everything drowned\'\""The water rose swiftly and, while we still deciding on evacuation, it reached chest-high. We could not take out anything. Everything we had, drowned. Only our lives were saved,\"" says Ms. Sunita, sitting on a cot, her children, two of them still in their school uniform, by her side.After escaping the flooded Devipurva village in Unnao on a boat along with her family, Sunita, who belongs to a community of traditional boatmen, a Backward Class, took shelter on a bridge connecting the district to Kanpur\'s Bithoor. All that they, along with dozens of other families, have for shelter are makeshift tarpaulin tents. With little or no cash, they are surviving on relief material and food packets provided by the administration, even as the river remains in its swollen state.\""The last time we saw such was situation was in 2011. We had to evacuate to another area. There is nothing to shelter us except for this tarpaulin. If it rains heavily again, we won\'t have anything to protect us,\"" says another Mallah woman, also named Sunita. The flood damaged all her crops, mattresses and clothes. Depressed by the annual flood situation along the Ganga, she lashes out at the government for failing to provide a permanent solution.\""Every time there is a flood, they provide us food packets, that\'s all,\"" she says.The recent bout of heavy rainfall has caused havoc in parts of U.P., with at least 80 persons dead since September 1, and over 2,000 houses and huts damaged or submerged, with territory of over 1.12 lakh hectares affected.According to the Uttar Pradesh Disaster Management Authority, on Thursday evening, there were still 153 marooned villages and 805 flood-affected villages in the State, directly impacting over 5 lakh people. On Thursday, 18 deaths were reported, with four each in Unnao and Faizabad, and two each in Rampur and Gonda, and 158 homes were damaged.According to Relief Commissioner Sanjay Kumar, till 5 p.m., 47,470 people had been evacuated to safe spots, while 21,629 were living in 170 relief camps across the State.In Unnao alone, 32,453 persons were rescued from 17 villages and more than 12,000 people are currently living in 32 relief camps.\""I don\'t know how long we will carry on like this.

db339d1a48,Will Trump Reinstate Reagan\'s Abortion Rule: For International - NPR - NPR,"For International Familiy Planning Charities : Goats and Soda : NPR<br />President Ronald Reagan at a political rally.<br />UniversalImagesGroup/Getty Images<br />hide caption<br />toggle caption<br />UniversalImagesGroup/Getty Images<br />President Ronald Reagan at a political rally.<br />UniversalImagesGroup/Getty Images<br />It\'s a policy battle that has been playing out over three decades. In 1984, then-President Ronald Reagan imposed an anti-abortion rule - known as the \""Mexico City policy\"" after the city where he announced it. The rule blocked federal funding for international family planning charities unless they agreed not to \""promote\"" abortion by, among other actions, providing patients with information about the procedure or referrals to providers who perform it. Since then, every time the U.S. presidency has changed party hands, the incoming leader has reversed his predecessor\'s position on the ban. President Clinton lifted it in 1993. President George W. Bush reinstated it in 2001. And President Obama rescinded it once more in 2009. <br />Will President-elect Trump continue the pattern by reimposing the policy? Trump hasn\'t taken a public position thus far. But when it comes to several domestic abortion questions he\'s aligned himself squarely with anti-abortion groups. His pick for vice president, Mike Pence, is a staunch abortion foe - as is his nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, Georgia congressman Tom Price. Trump has also promised to appoint what he\'s called \""pro-life\"" justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, who presumably might favor overturning Roe v. Wade. And he has said he would sign legislation banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood\'s U.S. activities. (Those federal funds go toward services that Trump has praised Planned Parenthood for providing, such as birth control and cancer screenings. But he\'s said the organization should nonetheless be defunded because it uses other, nonfederal funds to perform abortions at its affiliated health centers.) <br />Based on these stances, when it comes to the Mexico City policy, \""it\'s widely expected that President Trump will put it back in place,\"" says Jennifer Kates[1], vice president and director of Global Health & HIV Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. At issue is not whether the United States can use foreign aid money to fund abortions overseas. U.S. law has prohibited that since 1973, when Congress adopted the so-called Helms Amendment. Rather, with the Mexico City policy, President Reagan took that prohibition a step further: He issued an executive order that barred funding for groups that \""perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.\"" The term \""actively promote\"" has been defined to include both taking public positions in favor of laws and policies that protect abortion rights as well as informational conversations between health care clinicians and their patients, notes Alison Marshall, director of advocacy for International Planned Parenthood Federation[2], which stands to lose funding under the ban. \""When a woman or girl - and bearing in mind this could be somebody who suffered from gender-based violence or who has been married as a child underage - would go to see a health provider it would mean the provider could not talk to them about abortion, could not provide information, could not provide a referral to another provider [to perform an abortion],\"" says Marshall. And so, she says, each time the policy - which opponents have dubbed the \""global gag rule\"" - has been imposed, a large share of the nonprofit groups that work in the field have opted to give up U.S. support. Among anti-abortion groups, however, there is staunch support for the Mexico City policy. Deirdre McQuade is a spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops[3], which is among the anti-abortion groups urging Trump to reinstate the ban. It \""embodies the modest, widely accepted proposition that abortion is not family planning and should never be promoted as such,\"" says McQuade. \""Without the Mexico City Policy in place, the U.S. is currently exporting the destruction of life as a solution to challenges faced by families in developing countries. Poor women in developing nations don\'t want help aborting their children. They\'re calling for food, clean water, housing, education and medicine for their families.\"" McQuade adds that organizations that provide \""authentic health care services that honor the dignity of poor women and their families,\"" including screenings for cancer and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, should have no trouble complying with the policy. And groups that choose to give up their federal funding could seek private support, she says. For instance, she contends that when President George W. Bush reinstated the policy, IPPF \""was able to raise millions of dollars from private sources quickly.\"" Marshall counters that \""it was enormously disruptive because we faced enormous budget cuts very suddenly. And not just for [our group] but for other nonprofit providers, clinics had to be closed, staff had to be laid off. We just weren\'t able to offer the family planning services to the women and girls who needed them.\"" Obama\'s reversal of the Mexico City policy was accompanied by a new U.S. focus on women\'s reproductive health in poor countries. According to the Guttmacher Institute[4], a research group that supports abortion rights, the U.S. budget for the 2016 fiscal year included $607.5 million in funding[5] for reproductive health internationally, enabling an estimated 27 million couples in poor countries to get access to birth control and preventing about 11,000 maternal deaths. A large share of that money goes to IPPF. If the Mexico City policy were to be reimposed, Marshall says, the organization would lose about $100 million over a two- to three-year period for services it provides to women in 20 developing countries. These services mainly include care that is not related to abortion. But Marshall says complying with the terms of the Mexico City policy in order to keep U.S. funding is not an option IPPF would consider. \""We\'d have to stop telling women and girls when they came into our clinic what their options are,\"" she says. \""And we can\'t do that.\"" The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment on this article.<br />References^ Jennifer Kates (kff.org)^ International Planned Parenthood Federation (www.ippf.org)^ U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (www.usccb.org)^ Guttmacher Institute (www.guttmacher.org)^ U.S. budget for the 2016 fiscal year included $607.5 million in funding (www.guttmacher.org)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNE5LJFOj94Q_-nHy-c_1abpnR3Q2g&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779295569358&ei=03dkWfjaKITtzAaGv714&url=http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/12/06/503187530/will-trump-bring-back-the-reagan-rule-about-abortions,EN,,11/07/2017 07:01,2016-12-06 12:42:05+00:00,6df579530d,NPR,,,,,1481031725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
db5aa39aad,Keeping zinc out by using prefermented rape seed - All about feed,"Keeping zinc out by using prefermented rape seed<br />The medicinal use of zinc oxide can be replaced by adding prefermented rape seed through pig diets, according to the 1st results of a Danish scientific study.<br />Researchers at the University of Copenhagen[1], Denmark, tested whether the inclusion of rape seed cake, prefermented with lactobacillus, could substitute 2,500 ppm zinc. After all, zinc oxide has to be phased out[2] in the entire European Union by 2022. Additionally, they wanted to know if the preventive effect on diarrhoea would be more pronounced if the cake would contain brown macroalgae species.<br />First results or the research were published late January at the university\'s pig event \'Up to Date 2018\'[3]. Effects of lactic acid producing bacteria are often used as probiotic supplements to promote gut health, the researchers explained there, but results had not always been convincing, hence the trials.<br />Trials start before weaning<br />The researchers tested these ingredients in piglet diets from 10 days prior to weaning until 91 days post-weaning, when the pigs were on average 33kg. The scientists hoped to find the effects on feed intake and growth rate both by the end of the grower phase and at slaughter.<br />The trials were conducted at a commercial farm in ?osice, Poland. In total 9 different dietary treatment groups were included. <br />Diets offered to the pigs<br />The following diets were offered; each treatment group had 50 piglets per pen. <br />No supplementation of zinc (negative control);<br />2,500 ppm zinc oxide (positive control);<br />8% of dry matter as prefermented rape seed;<br />10% of dry matter as prefermented rape seed;<br />Similar to treatment group 4 + 0.6% of dry matter brown algae product;<br />Similar to treatment group 4 + 1.0% of dry matter brown algae product;<br />12% of dry matter as prefermented rape seed;<br />15% of dry matter as prefermented rape seed;<br />25% of dry matter as prefermented rape seed.<br />The ingredients were products used from Danish company Fermentation Experts[4]. The prefermented rape seed is commercially available as EP100i and the brown algae product as EP900.<br />Results of prefermented rape seed in pig diets<br />The researchers reported that feed supplied by prefermented rape seed, when compared to the negative control (without zinc) led to an increased average daily gain (ADG) from 10 days prior to weaning until exit from the weaner unit. <br />In addition, the researchers reported that villi and enterocytes were had developed, with maximum effects at 8 and 10% dry matter. On top, the diets improved small and large intestinal barrier function and the small intestine\'s surface area, and it reduced the number of lost and eliminated piglets without reducing the diarrhoea incidence.<br />Young piglets on a farm in Denmark. Photo: Henk Riswick <br />When comparing the feed supplied by prefermented rape seed with the positive control (with 2,500 ppm zinc), the scientists noted that both average daily gain and feed conversion ratios were better, leading to heavier piglets at weaning and exit. This prevented mortality and the need for antibiotic treatments to the same extent as in the zinc approach, according to the research team.<br />Results for brown algae in pig diets<br />The researchers also stated that adding the brown algae to the feed led to increased piglet weight at weaning. It also decreased average daily gain from day 31 to 64 after weaning and therefore decreased the exit weight. The brown algae addition blocked the stimulating effect of the prefermented rape seed approach on villi length and enterocyte height, but not its effect on the intestinal barrier function.<br />Further results are expected after March 2018, when the pigs involved will be sent for slaughter.<br />The presentation [5]was given by Prof Mette Olaf Nielsen, Gizaw Dabessa Satessa and Rajan Dhakal, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

db785b9eea,Veterinarian Offers Dairy Bull Calf Care Tips via Social Media | Dairy ... - Dairy Herd Management,"Veterinarian Offers Dairy Bull Calf Care Tips via Social Media<br />Dairy bull calves sometimes don\'t get the same attention as their female counterparts since they leave the farm at an earlier age. A veterinarian from Ohio is hoping to change that perception offering advice through social media on how to keep male dairy calves on a successful path that leads to consumer avenues like veal or beef.  <br />Veterinarian Marissa Hake did a social media takeover for Mackinson Dairy Farm[1] on Oct. 27 sharing videos and photos of her day caring for veal calves. In the posts Hake offered tips on managing the health of dairy bull calves.<br />\""I\'m really excited to share with you what I do every day,\"" Hake says in the first video. She specializes in veal calf care within Indiana, Michigan and Ohio.<br />Hake says that veal production has changed in the past 30 years to improve the care and comfort of calves. Rather than being housed individually, calves are more predominately raised in groups of 5-10 cattle after getting a start by themselves for the first 6-8 weeks of age.<br />Veal calves are fed a milk-based diet, with milk that is fortified with additional vitamins and minerals. They also receive some grain and forage to help balance the diet. <br />In Hake\'s fourth post farm workers can be seen drawing blood from a few calves. The blood samples are being taken to monitor iron levels in calves and help reduce the risk of anemia. Hake says this is important because veal calves don\'t get as much iron because milk is very low in the mineral, so additional supplementation might be needed. <br />In a fifth video Hake discusses what she looks for from bull calves after they leave a dairy. <br />Hydration status is at the top of the list. If the eyes are sunken in or when doing a skin tent test the hide doesn\'t bounce back quickly it is vital to get fluids and electrolytes into the calf. <br />\""Another thing we check is for naval infections. Go down and grab the naval. Check for tenderness, swelling, drainage, heat. If the calf has a really big naval we want to get that treated,\"" Hake says. <br />Another test Hake performs on new calves is for total protein status. Testing for total protein status lets a producer and veterinarian know if passive transfer of immunity has occurred from colostrum. <br />The total protein status test can be done by pulling blood from the calf, spinning the blood in a centrifuge and measuring blood plasma with a Brix Refractometer. <br />\""This can be done on farm, it is super easy. Usually do it between 2 to 5 days old. It is the best time to get the most accurate result,\"" Hake says of total protein status testing.<br />To end the social media takeover at Mackinson Dairy Farm, Hake shares some additional facts on veal. For instance, veal calves average around 500 lb. when going to a meat processor making them older than pork or poultry animals when going to market. <br />\""Care on the dairy farm is very important for bull calves whether they move onto dairy beef or veal,\"" Hake says.<br />To follow Hake and learn more about the work she does caring for veal calves follow her on Facebook at Dr. Hake - Calf Vet[2].<br />References^ Mackinson Dairy Farm (www.facebook.com)^ Dr. Hake - Calf Vet (www.facebook.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNG-4R3rtuCAIORM61DNpw97pBq3Qg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779656756888&ei=_C34WbjnD8SZzAbMpIX4CQ&url=https://www.dairyherd.com/article/veterinarian-offers-dairy-bull-calf-care-tips-social-media,EN,,31/10/2017 08:01,2017-10-30 18:35:55+00:00,d4f07714c5,Dairy Herd Management,,,,,1509392155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
db85fabc26,Western Homestead: Your Winter Checklist - Cowboys and Indians,"Your Winter Checklist - Cowboys and Indians Magazine<br />Learn how to winter-proof your Western homestead.<br />The restful, relaxing days of deep winter-when nothing is growing and not much has to get done each day, besides livestock chores and keeping the wood box filled-are a welcome respite from the urgencies of the growing season.<br />Though parts of the country don\'t always experience a true winter-like the far southwest, most of Florida, and quite a bit of the west coast-many regions must routinely prepare for air temperatures below freezing, a ground that\'s frozen, and bursts of snow and ice storms[1]. Sometimes otherwise warm winter climates face unexpected weather changes and dips in temperature.<br />For me, the winter season is the perfect time for catching up on paperwork, finishing indoor projects, and planning ahead for a smooth spring. Here\'s a list of what to get done this winter, and how to prepare your Western homestead for the coming growing season and year ahead.<br />LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY<br />Check the animals twice a day, and give them water, feed, and clean bedding. Watch for coughs, lameness, or any other signs of illness-catching problems early makes them easier to solve.<br />If more than half of your hay or other feed is gone by mid-winter, find and buy some more to make sure you\'ll get through until spring. Hay gets more expensive the closer it gets to spring.<br />Order chicks, find out where you can get weaner pigs, or a new bull, ram, or billy if that\'s what you\'ll need for the coming season.<br />This is the best time of year to trap or poison rats and mice. Make sure that poison and traps are placed where pets, poultry, and livestock can\'t get at them.<br />GARDEN<br />Order seeds now, when selection and availability are at their best.<br />Review your notes from last year to plan the upcoming rotation, which vegetable varieties you liked or not, and identify where there were big insect, weed, or disease problems. Make plans for getting on top of those next year before things get out of hand.<br />ORCHARD<br />Order new trees for early spring delivery, as well as any needed pest controls.<br />Sprinkle wood ashes from the stove lightly at the drip line around the trees.<br />Begin pruning fruit trees in late winter, removing the water sprouts and branches that are too crowded or interfere with each other.<br />EQUIPMENT<br />Order or buy parts: belts, blades, chains, cotter pins, etc. Buy supplies such as grease, engine oil, lubricating oil, hydraulic fluid, and so on. Clean, sharpen, or replace worn tools.<br />WOODLOT<br />If you own trees (besides the ones in the orchard), now\'s the time to prune and thin for better growth. Leave the best ones and use the worst-the dying, sick, crippled, and stunted-for firewood.<br />If you have or can find a neighbor with a small sawmill, you can harvest some big trees and turn them into lumber.<br />When it\'s too wet, the snow is too deep, or it\'s just too darn cold to be out in the woods, treat yourself to some time in your wood shop. For me, the best part of winter is spending time in the woods or in my wood shop.<br />KITCHEN AND COLD CELLAR<br />Check over pumpkins, squash, potatoes, apples, onions, and any other stored fruits or vegetables once a week and remove anything that is starting to rot.<br />Herbs that were hung to dry last summer can be processed into flakes (I rub them through a colander) and put in a jar for easy use.<br />Fruits that were juiced at harvest and the juice frozen or canned because there was no time to do more can be made into jelly.<br />One last, very important note: with the wildfire season[2] slowing down, take the time now to protect your home from danger next season. Pick up woody debris near the house and burn it when it\'s raining or there\'s snow on the ground. Brush and high grasses and forbs near the house should be mowed or cut to the ground. Prune the lower branches of nearby trees and thin them so their canopies (the upper branches) aren\'t touching. This will slow or even stop fires from reaching your buildings.

db8efa73b1,Is there room in the party for pro-life Democrats? - Philly.com,"Is there room in the party for pro-life Democrats?<br />WEST POINT, Iowa - It takes less than five minutes to discover that family, public service, and community are the true treasures in Ron Fedler\'s life. And, of course, \""love and respect for country,\"" he says while sitting in his living room. This Lee County town is home to 966 people and the state\'s largest sweet corn festival. <br />It doesn\'t take much longer to realize that Fedler should be treasured by the Democratic Party. <br />Photos of his children, grandchildren, and nieces and nephews dot the walls of the modest red-brick home he built himself. <br />To the left of his easy chair is a framed black-and-white print of his parents and 11 of his 12 siblings. He notes, \""My older brother had already left for Vietnam and missed the family photo.\"" <br />Across the room, an 11-by-14-inch framed color photo of President John F. Kennedy sits atop a coffee table. It\'s Louis Fabian Bachrach\'s iconic 1961 official photograph of Kennedy at his White House desk, that innocent moment at the start of Camelot; a moment of promise before the Bay of Pigs, before the Cuban missile crisis, and before his assassination. <br />Fedler says Kennedy will always be his hero. <br />He is not one of those Democrats who fled his party in 2016 to vote for Donald Trump. He thinks the president is off-putting and erratic. But he understands why fellow Lee County Democrats chose Trump. <br />\""This goes beyond frustration and anger,\"" he explains. \""Experts fundamentally misread the voters\' motives who went from happily supporting former president Barack Obama to equally happily supporting Trump on election night. <br />\""They liked Obama, but many of his policies hurt them and their communities, and they wanted someone who they felt listened to them.\"" Trump filled that void, he says. <br />In 2012, Lee County cast 9,428 votes for Obama and 6,787 for Mitt Romney. Four years later, the numbers were nearly reversed, with 8,762 votes for Trump and 6,195 for Hillary Clinton. <br />Trump carried every precinct in a county long dominated by Democrats and unions. <br />In 2016, you had people who stopped believing in the more progressive policies of Washington Democrats, who are very different than Lee County Democrats. <br />Fedler is the perfect Lee County Democrat: born and raised there, and drafted at age 19 to serve as a radio Teletype operator with a secret crypto clearance. His clearances were so top-secret that he never told his wife where he was stationed or what he did. \""I made a pledge to my country not to divulge that information, and I will forever honor that,\"" he says. <br />The military brass were so impressed that they offered him an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. But he wanted to return to West Point, Iowa, so he respectfully declined. <br />After attending the local community college, he worked as a mason for four years, and then for an energy company, saving his money to buy Dugan\'s Corner Convenience Store, which he ran for 30 years. He eventually sold it and then worked as a correctional officer at Iowa State Penitentiary. <br />He won a seat on city council and served three terms as mayor. Next, he ran as a Democrat for the Iowa state House and lost. He ran again, and lost again. <br />Today, he\'s in his second term as a county supervisor. <br />His is a history of compromise, consensus building, and accomplishing projects. He is tireless, well-liked, and, more importantly, respected. <br />When he discusses the opening of the Iowa Fertilizer plant last month in Lee County, there\'s no \""I\"" mentioned, and no grandstanding over it being one of the largest private-sector projects in state history and the first world-class nitrogen fertilizer facility built in the United States in more than 25 years. <br />Of the elections he lost, he sounds sensible; of the ones he won, he sounds humble. \""What I do is not for me, it\'s for the community - we don\'t want our people ... our communities to fade away,\"" he says. <br />In short, he\'s what Democratic leaders should covet and how the party\'s candidates should model themselves. <br />In reality, Democrats up and down the ballot are divided, struggling, and searching for a unified message. <br />The folks at the top of the party aren\'t exactly role models for how to reach out to Middle America voters who fled the party in droves over the past eight years. You don\'t lose 1,100 down-ballot offices - state legislative, congressional and governor seats - by connecting with working-class voters. <br />According to Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, Fedler has no place in the party - not because he\'s white, male, and over 60, but because he\'s anti-abortion. <br />In April, Perez drew a line in the sand against candidates who oppose abortion rights. This is not the only reason Democrats lost so many offices, but it is a big one. It\'s elitist and tone-deaf, and it shuts out a great amount of support that should come their way. <br />Then there\'s Hillary Clinton. <br />As one Democratic strategist told me in an anguished email, \""Won\'t she please go away?\"" This from someone who supported her. <br />Last week, in yet another speech, Clinton vaguely admitted to some mistakes in 2016. But then she accused the party of failing to raise money or back her in any meaningful manner. <br />Democrats have history on their side for 2018: Ninety percent of the time, a president\'s party loses congressional seats in the midterm elections. <br />What they don\'t have are the right people in the limelight: Clinton blames everyone else; Perez is intolerant; and the party can\'t adopt a simple jobs message. <br />Go on a field trip to West Point, Iowa, and learn from the Ron Fedlers of the party. <br />Fedler isn\'t on Twitter. He works hard. He compromises. And he gets things done. And when he loses, he takes the blame. <br />Salena Zito is a CNN political analyst, and a staff reporter and columnist for the Washington Examiner.

12d4feb339,Keele Golf Course - an asset that was left to rot - Stoke Sentinel,"Keele Golf Course - an asset that was left to rot<br />Comments (1)<br />[1]<br />Something needs to be done to reverse the shocking state of disrepair at Keele Golf Course, says columnist Jenny Amphlett.It\'s hard to see any part of your home town fall into decline, but even more so when it\'s somewhere that holds special memories for you personally.That\'s how it feels now when I look at the mess that Keele Golf Course has become.It\'s a place where my family and I have spent many happy times over the decades, both out on the greens and in the club house. <br />It\'s where my brother held his wedding reception and we toasted his future with Guinness and Champagne cocktails. It\'s where we sat down to many family Christmas Day lunches and, in more recent years, it became our favourite curry restaurant.Between us, we\'ve spent thousands of hours out on those greens with either a golf club or a dog lead in our hands.I\'ve seen badgers, foxes, grass snakes, newts, dragonflies, toads, woodpeckers and more on that land.I\'ve collected pine cones and picked blackberries there with my little girl, and we\'ve played Billy Goats Gruff over the little bridges.Together we\'ve watched the geese, ducks and moorhens return to nest and rear their young each year, but the lesser spotted golfer hasn\'t been seen since the course was closed in 2014.Every time I visit now I feel a mixture of sadness at the loss of what it once was, and anger at what it has been allowed to become.Read more: Motorists face THREE MONTHS of disruption as A34 shuts[2]The clubhouse is boarded up and covered in graffiti, with thick weeds forcing up the flagstones.Benches, waste bins and the old golfer\'s bell have been stolen. Any bins that have been left behind are overflowing with uncollected litter and bags of dog waste.There are glass alcohol bottles strewn around burnt patches where people have lit makeshift fires.When I was there at the weekend, helmetless motorbikers were tearing across the once pristine grass.Invasive Himalayan Balsam weeds are now marching across the land like triffids. They reach well over head height in places, smothering other vegetation as they go, and they\'re heading towards the gardens of Silverdale homes that back onto the course.It\'s now hard to imagine that people were playing golf on this land just a few short years ago. Sadly I can\'t see any realistic way back to those times.Keele was once considered a golf course of such high quality that U.S. Masters winner Ian Woosnam considered taking it on and running it as a business. The deal fell through after a disagreement with the borough council over the finances involved.I was actually out on Keele Golf Course on one of the days Ian Woosnam came to visit. He and council officers zipped past us on golf buggies.To me, personally, it feels like the political will has never been there to retain Keele for golf when there is much more cash to be made from a housing development.I will never support the idea of Keele Golf Course being taken out of the green belt and turned into a housing estate. However, grudgingly, I now concede that some development may have to happen around the edges to pay for some sort of upkeep or maintenance for the rest of the site.It\'s in a shocking state and will only get worse if it\'s left to rot even further.Read more: Doctors issue advice to people suffering from hacking cough and cold[3]<br />References^ Comments (1) (news.google.com)^ Motorists face THREE MONTHS of disruption as A34 shuts (www.stokesentinel.co.uk)^ Doctors issue advice to people suffering from hacking cough and cold (www.stokesentinel.co.uk)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGD6g6pOfkZyNMnKenkrvs-Ilp_Hw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=pYt0WNitA8qQW625haAB&url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/keele-golf-course-an-asset-that-was-left-to-rot/story-30041827-detail/story.html,EN,,10/01/2017 08:05,2017-01-09 11:50:09+00:00,5b41d61294,Stoke Sentinel,,,,,1483966209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dbb790873b,New Israeli venture hopes to revolutionize small dairy farms in Vietnam - Jerusalem Post Israel News,"New Israeli venture hopes to revolutionize small dairy farms in Vietnam - Business & Innovation<br />A stone\'s throw away from the buzzing metropolis of Ho Chi Minh City, south Vietnam\'s array of small dairy farms sit tucked away among muddy dirt paths and lush fields of elephant grass - clinging to cultivation practices from decades ago.But with milk yield and quality lagging far below accepted standards, one Israeli-owned company hopes to revolutionize the sector.\""In Vietnam, more than 60 percent of the dairy industry is small household farmers - somewhere between four cows and 70 cows,\"" Ronen Zexer, a co-founder of a new enterprise called Smart Feed Solutions, told The Jerusalem Post on a Skype call last week.<br />\""These farms are utilizing technology and know-how that is equivalent to Israel back in the 1940s and 1950s,\"" Zexer said. \""These farmers do not have access to technology and to know-how and to the progress that was made in the dairy industry. At the same time, they need to compete in the market.\""Zexer, who in the past served as CEO of the dairy technology leader Afimilk and has consulted for the Israeli-Vietnamese TH Milk mega project, is heading a co-investment between Israeli and Dutch entrepreneurs in a new approach to the challenges of the dairy industry in developing countries.With so many Vietnamese workers dependent on the sector, yet continuing to rely on methods that date back 80 years, Zexer said that he intends to bring technologies and services to the farmers.\""The rural way of life is under great pressure. Farmers who cannot make a living are deserting the farms and moving to the city,\"" he said. \""The young generation does not want to come and take over.\""Zexer and his Israeli and Dutch investment partners established Smart Feed Solutions about a year ago, aiming to offer small household dairy farmers a total mix ration (TMR) forage - a balanced and nutritious cattle feed unavailable to the herds today. With construction now complete on a factory in Long An province, about two hours from Ho Chi Minh City (population more than 8 million), the company is ready to begin selling its product to local farms.Coupled with the feeding solution, Zexer said SFS will be offering a set of services to cope with the region\'s most pressing issues, such as data management, fertility problems, lameness- related illnesses, somatic cell counts (an indicator of milk\'s likeliness to contain harmful bacteria, and thus its food safety) and general husbandry needs.\""Almost all foreign companies who are involved in the dairy industry focus on the mega-project,\"" Zexer said.\""Smart Feed Solutions is taking a new approach. We are focusing on the market sector of small household farms that is seen as less interesting because the challenge of introducing technology is more difficult.\""More and more, big dairy companies such as Vinamilk, which purchase milk from local farmers, are demanding products of higher quality, Zexer explained. The price the farmer gets from Vinamilk and other firms depends on several factors, such as the presence of solids like proteins, fats and lactose in the milk, as well as the quantity of somatic cells - which can indicate infection in the cow, he added.As far as data administration is concerned, SFS will be using Afimilk\'s AfiFarm herd management software to analyze data collected by farmers and submitted to the firm, Zexer explained. While such data collection typically is automated in a modern farming setting, SFS will enable farmers to manually submit their data and then receive an analytical report generated on the company\'s server.For the time being, the company\'s focus will be the approximately 100,000 dairy cows in the vicinity of Ho Chi Minh City, Zexer said. The hope is that SFS can then replicate its services to other areas of Vietnam and to neighboring countries with similar needs.\""We believe that one year down the road, the farmers will see a significant change in the way they do farming and the results they see on the farms,\"" he continued.Acknowledging that the solution will not bring the dairy farmers up to the level of their Israeli colleagues, Zexer said that their productivity could improve by 40-50 percent.Statistics aside, Zexer recognized the difficulties he will likely face in convincing local farmers, who often have meager funds and methods that have been ingrained for generations, that they will benefit from buying the SFS feed and service package. The idea of paying more for feed and services in the short-term and reaping the benefits in the long-term could present an obstacle to some customers, as \""farmers by nature are conservative people,\"" he explained.Nonetheless, Zexer expressed confidence that the company would find the \""early adapters\"" that it is seeking.\""The biggest challenge we have is the cultural difference,\"" he said. \""As you can expect, some of the farmers are reluctant and say, \'No we cannot not.\' Some say that we want to see who else is doing it and make a decision. Some are saying, \'This is a huge issue, we are glad you guys came along to help us do better.\' \""You have people who have aspirations to improve their farm,\"" he added. \""The others will follow once they see the benefits and the pressure from the market.\""While focusing on the local dairy industry, Zexer said that SFS is simultaneously working on a project to export its forage to nearby countries like Korea and Japan. These countries and others in the region have highly developed dairy industries but import their forage products at a high cost across the Pacific Ocean, from the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and others, he explained.Although unique in its emphasis on small farms, SFS is not the first Israeli venture to enter the Vietnamese dairy sector.The $200 million TH Milk facility, which houses some 20,000 cows in central Vietnam, is the result of an agreement signed between Afimilk and the Vietnamese firm TH Milk in 2009. This enormous undertaking, which includes 12 milking parlors, is the largest Israeli dairy farming project in the world.Meanwhile, on a government- to-government level, an Israeli Dairy Demonstration and Experimental Farm has been operating just outside Ho Chi Minh City since August 2013. The farm, overseen by the Foreign Ministry\'s Mashav Agency for International Development Cooperation and the Agriculture Ministry\'s Center for International Agricultural Development Cooperation, houses 230 cows and provides a place for local farmers to learn about increasing milking efficiency and quality.Dagan Sadrinas, the Israeli manager of the demonstration farm, said SFS is choosing the \""right way\"" by offering the forage and services package to farmers. He stressed, however, that the company will \""need to educate the market.\""\""It\'s a difficult thing but it can be accomplished,\"" Sadrinas told the Post. \""When they will do it, they will prove the high value of these kinds of things - of foods and service and management.\""Education will be critical, as Vietnamese farmers are not accustomed to paying for such services and therefore must be able to accept that the high quality product will not lead to instant results, according to Sadrinas.\""The result will be in the long term,\"" he said. \""The farmers there don\'t know how to look in the long term. They care about today.\""While the company will need to demonstrate to the customers that the product is worthwhile, and may reduce profits when starting out, Sadrinas maintained his support for the idea and expressed his hopes that the vision succeeds.\""This is the beginning - they need to learn the market and the market needs to learn their product,\"" Sadrinas said.\""I think this is the right way for Vietnam... it\'s also a good name for Israel.\""Zexer is confident that in this market, the early adapters will boost the concept\'s popularity, leading more and more farmers to sign up for the services.\""We believe it can be done, it can be profitable for the farmers and for the investors in SFS and it will support important social values such as enhancing the rural way of life to reduce migration of farmers to the metropolitan areas and agriculture sustainability,\"" he said. \""These issues are critical for developing countries. We will improve the livelihood of many people involved in the dairy production chain.\""<br />Think others should know about this?

Graphic by Jason Drees/Biodesign Institute<br />Download Full Image[1]<br />\""We learned that our new process of antibody production is incredibly efficient. If the membrane protein is naturally immunogenic, we easily generated high levels of antibodies using the genes alone,\"" Hansen (pictured below) said. \""Rather than laboriously purifying the membrane protein and attempting to maintain the proper protein structure within detergents prior to immunization, we let the immunized host do the work for us.\"" <br />The new study also describes a method for expressing and purifying membrane proteins in a test tube and examining their binding activities with specific antibodies in blood extracted from gene-immunized mice.<br />Conventionally, producing an immune response to a foreign protein requires purification of the protein, which is then injected into an animal. The process is cumbersome, challenging and time consuming. In the current study, an immune response is instead produced by directly introducing a gene encoding the protein of interest.<br />Two of the membrane proteins produced in the study were also successfully introduced into membranes of the bacterium E. coli, through the process of recombinant DNA. Use of the specific antibodies present in blood from gene-immunized mice demonstrated for the first time that both membrane proteins could be recombinantly expressed in a live organism, correctly fold into proper 3-D structures and migrate to the membranes within E. coli. These results now facilitate the structural determination of these two critical virulence proteins.<br />The research, which appears in the current issue of the Nature Publishing Group journal Scientific Reports[2], promises to deliver new insights into the structure and function of membrane proteins of critical importance for medicine.<br />On the surface<br />Membrane proteins are implicated in innumerable functions in living organisms including cell signaling and communication, energy conversion and utilization, molecular transport and catalysis. Due to their involvement in a range of diseases, they have recently become primary targets for a new range of therapeutics. Indeed, more than 50 percent of all therapeutic targets are membrane proteins. The number is expected to rise as more is learned about membrane protein structure and function.<br />Despite their important role as the molecular interface in host/pathogen interactions as well as drug/cell relationships, membrane proteins account for less than 1 percent of the 100,000 unique protein structures presently catalogued. This is largely due to the serious challenges involved in producing, purifying and determining the structures of membrane proteins. Hansen and her colleagues outline new strategies to produce antibodies - specialized proteins produced naturally by the immune system in response to pathogens or other threatening biological agents.<br />In the current study, they describe the use of a gene gun to introduce DNA information into a mouse. The handheld device uses a burst of gas to propel gold particles impregnated with circular DNAs known as plasmids into the skin in mice. The gold particles are known as micronanoplexes. The gene gun technology was pioneered and developed by Stephen A. Johnston, co-director of the Biodesign Center for Innovations in Medicine.<br />The genetic material introduced via the gene gun is taken up by mouse dendritic cells and translated into membrane protein in dermal tissues and lymph nodes. The mouse immune system responds by producing specific antibodies capable of binding to the membrane proteins. While the basic technique of genetic immunization has been in use for some time, the study marks the first description of the broad applicability of this approach to membrane proteins, as well as the first application of DNA-gold micronanoplexes to stimulate antibody production.<br />Bacterial and viral menaces examined<br />Results showed that genetic immunization successfully produced antibodies specific to 12 out of 17 membrane proteins from two Biosafety Level 3 pathogens: Francisella tularensis and African swine fever virus (ASFV). F. tularensis causes the disease tularemia. It is a widely studied infectious pathogen notorious for its ability to invade numerous cell types and cleverly evade the immune system. It is one of the most pathogenic bacteria on Earth, capable of causing a fatal infection with as few as 10 cells. African swine fever virus is carried by arthropods. Infection in pigs causes a lethal and untreatable hemorrhagic disease that has devastated swine populations in areas of Africa and Eastern Europe.<br />Investigations of endogenous disease proteins produced by these organisms are difficult, requiring specialized safety facilities and protocols due to the potential danger they pose to researchers. The new method described permits the production of these pathogens\' membrane proteins and associated antibodies through DNA-based approaches, permitting the safe handling of biological material without risk of infection.<br />Once antibodies to specific membrane proteins have been produced in the mouse, the group sought to characterize the resulting mouse blood or sera. To do this, a new system known as in vitro translation in the presence of hydrophobic magnetic beads (IVT-HMB) was developed. Here, a small quality of membrane protein is produced in a test tube, simultaneously extracted using hydrophobic beads, then screened against the sera extracted from gene-immunized mice. Detection of a resulting signal in two types of diagnostic tests or assays (ELISA and Western blot) established the presence in the mouse sera of antibodies specific to each membrane protein. The IVT-HMB method represents a powerful streamlining of the production of membrane proteins, precluding the arduous process of isolation and purification traditionally required.<br />Stepping-stone to protein structures<br />Using X-rays to image tiny crystals of proteins is a powerful method to determine detailed protein structure, but the technique faces many challenges, including the difficulty of producing and purifying proteins that assemble properly. The current research marks a starting point for further structural characterization of membrane proteins, using such techniques as cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography.<br />Petra Fromme, a co-author of the new study and director of the Biodesign Institute\'s Center for Applied Structural Discovery, highlights the power of the new research: \""The range of antibodies produced through techniques like genetic immunization opens the door to high-resolution molecular images of important membrane proteins,\"" she said. \""The resulting antibodies assist structural determination in a variety of important ways, identifying properly assembled proteins, helping to induce proteins to assemble with other proteins into well-ordered crystals and stabilizing or trapping proteins in active states that can be imaged using X-rays.\""<br />In the next phase of research, the group plans to produce monoclonal antibodies using the same immunization process. These are essential as co-crystallization binding factors or ligands, used for the structural determination of membrane proteins via X-ray crystallography. The authors further note that the monoclonal antibodies produced through genetic immunization techniques offer attractive candidates for future therapeutics against a broad range of diseases.<br />This study was a combined effort of faculty in the Biodesign Institute, including Debra Hansen from the Center for Innovations in Medicine (CIM), Center for Applied Structural Discovery (CASD) and the School of Molecular Sciences (SMS), Kathryn Sykes from CIM and Petra Fromme from CASD and SMS, along with their teams of researchers and students, including: research scientists Mark Robida, Andrey Loskutov and Tien Olson, researchers Felicia Craciunescu, John-Charles Rodenberry and Hetal Patel and graduate student Xiao Wang from CIM and postdoc Katerina Dörner from SMS.<br />All of the necessary clones (plasmid DNAs) for applying this approach are available through the DNASU Plasmid Repository, which is housed in Biodesign\'s Center for Personalized Diagnostics.<br />This work was funded by the NIH (NIGMS) under the PSI:Biology program, as part of the MPID (Membrane Proteins in Infectious Diseases) U54 grant, directed by Petra Fromme.<br />References^ Download Full Image (asunow.asu.edu)^ Scientific Reports (news.google.com)<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGPNfXvDZcx4NUTOBCIBfMG_3-amg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779052335498&ei=SanSVumBAp_Va4fQkpgF&url=https://asunow.asu.edu/20160224-images-asu%25E2%2580%2599s-lunar-reconnaissance-orbiter-camera-featured-new-exhibition-smithsonian%25E2%2580%2599s,EN,,28/02/2016 08:01,2016-02-24 17:50:41+00:00,3c4acf1de1,Arizona State University,,,,,1456339841,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dbd4c1e8bd,Medical board asked to drop anti-abortion boss as president - WHIO,"Medical board asked to drop anti-abortion boss as preside<br />Updated: Tuesday, September 06, 2016 @ 12:50 AMPublished: Monday, September 05, 2016 @ 1:38 AMBy: <br />AP White House Correspondent<br />Columbus <br />- Two months from Election Day, Hillary Clinton has a clear edge over Donald Trump in nearly every measure traditionally used to gauge success in presidential races.<br />She\'s raising huge sums of money and flooding airwaves with television advertisements. A sophisticated data team with a history of winning White House contests is meticulously tracking voters in key battleground states. Clinton also has multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win in November - so many that she could lose Ohio and Florida and still become America\'s first female president.<br />But Trump\'s campaign believes there are pockets of voters eager to be persuaded not to back Clinton. While Trump squandered a summer\'s worth of opportunities to court those voters, his campaign heads into the fall suddenly confident in its ability to make up lost ground.<br />Trump aides were gleeful Friday over the release of FBI notes regarding Clinton\'s controversial email practices while secretary of state. His campaign plans to come out of the Labor Day weekend wielding the report as a warning about the Democrat\'s judgment.<br />Getting Trump to make that kind of consistent case against Clinton has been a herculean task for much of the campaign. But advisers say he\'s more receptive to his new leadership team\'s more scripted approach, mostly because it\'s coincided with a tightening in the public polls he monitors obsessively.<br />\""There\'s a renewed focus on Hillary Clinton and her problems, which I think has been beneficial,\"" said Matt Borges, the chairman of Ohio\'s Republican Party. \""He\'s got to sustain this for another couple weeks.\""<br />Still, Trump aides acknowledge that the brash businessman needs to do more to address his own shaky standing with voters.<br />Trump\'s campaign has spent no general election money on positive, biographical ads, despite having plenty of cash to do so. Efforts to highlight a warmer side of the New York real estate developer at the GOP convention were quickly overshadowed by flaps of his own making. He\'s also angered anew Hispanics voters, a fast-growing segment of the electorate that Republicans are desperate to draw from, by holding fast to his tough immigration policies.<br />\""He\'s running up against a population trend and a demographic reality,\"" said Steve Schale, a Florida-based Democratic strategist.<br />If Trump can reshape the race, he\'ll need to do so quickly. Early voting begins in some states this month. North Carolinians can start submitting absentee ballots Friday. In Ohio - a state no Republican has won the White House without - people can start voting on Oct. 12, a week before the last of three presidential debates.<br />Both campaigns expect enormous audiences for the debates. Clinton, who has been in intensive study sessions with her debate team in recent days, is sure to face higher expectations from voters. Trump\'s political inexperience leaves him with a lower bar to clear.<br />Privately, Republican leaders say it will take more than strong debates for their nominee to alter a race that appears to be leaning in Clinton\'s favor. While Trump publicly maintains support from numerous high-ranking GOP officials, a striking number of discussions among Republicans in Washington often begin with an assumption that Clinton will be president come January.<br />Trump advisers vigorously dispute that the race has slipped from their grasp. They contend most Americans are just now tuning into the presidential campaign in a serious way.<br />\""We\'re very much on schedule to do what we need to do to turn out the vote for Mr. Trump,\"" said Bob Paduchik, Trump\'s Ohio state director and one of the most experienced operatives on the Republican\'s staff. Paduchik said Trump\'s efforts heading into the fall are focused primarily on rallying \""disaffected Democrats and independents.\""<br />Clinton\'s campaign has long argued that Trump is overestimating the number of voters willing to switch from voting Democratic in presidential elections to Republican. But Clinton aides are monitoring movement toward a pair of third party candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party\'s Jill Stein.<br />\""There\'s no question you\'ve got two candidates who are both underwater on their favorables right now,\"" Joel Benenson, Clinton\'s chief strategist and pollster, said by way of explaining the appeal of Johnson and Stein. \""I think it\'s important as this gets closer that people understand the stakes and the importance of their vote.\""<br />Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine will have an all-star stable of Democrats making that case on their behalf through the fall.<br />President Barack Obama is expected to spend much of October campaigning for Clinton, focusing in particular on increasing turnout among young people, blacks and college-educated whites. Vice President Joe Biden will camp out in working class areas of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton\'s vanquished primary rival, will be rallying the young voters and liberals who backed his campaign.<br />Trump will be largely on his own, with the exception of running mate Mike Pence and a few loyal supporters such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. In the battle for control of the Senate, most Republicans in competitive races have stayed away from Trump.<br />Democrats now see a clear path to taking back control of the Senate, with party leaders identifying Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as favorable opportunities to pick up seats. Democrats are also confident that if Clinton wins in some of the most contested state such as New Hampshire, North Carolina and Nevada, she\'ll bring along the party\'s Senate candidates.<br />There are bright spots for Republicans in the Senate contests. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio is running a campaign that mirrors Clinton\'s more than Trump\'s - disciplined, well-funded, and heavily centered on data - and appears on track to hold his seat, even if Clinton carries the state in the presidential race.<br />___<br />Associated Press writer Chad Day in Washington contributed to this report.<br />___<br />Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHXc4blkkLEwhEsJqLph9rHl_yd_A&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779193605205&ei=embOV5CAGtWNzAakwZyYCg&url=http://www.whio.com/news/medical-board-asked-drop-anti-abortion-boss-president/n93qm83SHnw6frSQn3P72O/,EN,,06/09/2016 07:09,2016-08-22 15:45:48+00:00,95c728a7b8,WHIO,,,,,1471887948,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ff123b8533,A sea of red in a state of blue - Effingham Daily News,"A sea of red in a state of blue | Local News<br />It\'s a warmer-than-usual March morning in rural Beecher City when Dallas Buzzard and his wife, Sherry, welcome a group of coffee drinkers to their home. On the kitchen table sit two boxes of locally made glazed doughnuts.The group includes Dallas\'s brothers, Virgil and Ronnie Buzzard. His sister, Mary Jo, and her husband, Bruce Kessler, are also here. They\'re joined by Virgil\'s wife, Vicki.The men get together nearly every morning, usually to talk about their plans for the day. But on this first Saturday of March, they delve into politics. Their bent is deeply conservative; their support for President Donald Trump unabashed.<br />A white ball cap sits on Bruce\'s head: \""Presidential Coalition\"" is inscribed on the front, \""Trump Team\"" on the back.When someone mentions the news media, eyes roll.\""CNN and MSNBC, you flip it on any time during the day or night, and they\'ve got somebody they\'ve brought in to put Trump down,\"" says Dallas, 78, a retired railroad worker. \""Some is justified, maybe to a certain extent, but not 24/7.\""Bruce, his brother-in-law, sees something more sinister behind the talk on cable news and elsewhere.\""It seems like there is a movement out there to put Trump down at every turn,\"" says the retired state worker, 82, who lives in Altamont. \""But he\'s really done a lot for the country, in the year that he\'s been in there. I think he\'s a man with a vision and he knows how to go after it.\""Dallas mainly tunes in Fox News. But he\'ll sometimes surf to CNN and other channels.\""To see what they\'re putting out, and see if their tilt has ever changed,\"" he explains. \""Which it hasn\'t. If you take over the news media and you\'re the one feeding people information, they\'re going to believe it. And if you can fool part of the people part of the time, as Lincoln said, that\'s usually good enough.\""I\'m thinking Fox News is one that will show both sides. Not that I agree with them all the time, but where else is there somebody who will stand up and say, \'Hey now, let\'s see if we\'re really putting out the truth, or are we putting out a position that is our position?\'\""Dallas admits the president isn\'t perfect. But who is?\""I think there was only one perfect man,\"" he says. \""Jesus.\""No resident of the White House will ever be perfect, members of the coffee klatch agree.\""If you dwell on his inadequacies, his weak points, which he has - if you dwell on that, that means that\'s all you\'re looking for,\"" Dallas observes. \""You\'re not looking for the good side. And this is the side you never hear from the media.\""Some of the things negative are true. But they never put out the positive.\""Tax cut enthusiasmIn January, Effingham business owner Tony Griffith told his 65 full-time employees that he would give each of them a $1,000 bonus. Griffith owns Griffith Trucking in Effingham, which also incorporates the moving company Broadway Express. He also owns Heartland Peterbilt in Effingham, which sells and services trucks, and Heartland Classics in Effingham and Newton, which sells classic cars.The announcement came just days after Trump\'s State of the Union address, in which he made the case that the tax reform he pushed and a Republican Congress passed was the reason companies across the country boosted wages, awarded bonuses and increased benefits.In Effingham, it would have been difficult to find an employee of Griffith\'s who didn\'t celebrate the positives of a Trump presidency.\""I\'m excited for my employees,\"" Griffith said at the time.He anticipated he would save about $100,000 under the new law.\""This gives them hope that they are not just working at some hum-drum job, paying them the same until they die,\"" Griffith said.\""I\'ve never really had anything like this happen before,\"" said 24-year-old Brian Roberts, who lives in Stewardson in Shelby County. \""It\'s the first job I\'ve ever had to get any kind of bonus or anything.\""Husband and wife Kristi and Rich Stoddard were also enthusiastic. With three children, they said it was a more than welcome gesture.\""Anytime your paycheck increases, it\'s definitely a good thing for your family,\"" said Kristi Stoddard. \""It\'s nice to see they\'re putting money back into the middle class.\""\""We\'ll be able to pay more bills,\"" added her husband. \""We might be able to go out for dinner. Do the little things we might not be able to do until this kicks in. Honestly, your paycheck, you know where it\'s going even before you get it. Now we have a little extra.\""A blue voiceYou can count Brian Poelker among that tiny percentage of Effingham County residents who didn\'t vote for Trump.The retired teacher lives in Heartville, just south of Effingham. He\'s been bothered by a lot of Trump\'s comments. Unlike the coffee-drinking friends up in Beecher City, Brian thinks the media has been fair.\""I enjoy \'Morning Joe\' (on MSNBC), and they kind of do both sides there,\"" he says. \""They have Republicans on there, as well. I think people need to look at what is said and evaluate it. I don\'t have a problem with the news media. I read it, and I try to evaluate what\'s there based on what\'s said. In my opinion, I think there\'s liberal and conservative and they\'re going to present their side.\""Brian, 65, voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. While that puts him decidedly in the minority around these parts, it doesn\'t make him uncomfortable.\""Effingham County has always been very Republican, as far as their votes are concerned,\"" he says. \""So? That\'s why you vote. That\'s why you live here. You get your vote.\""Brian taught science in public education for over 30 years near Peoria, and at Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, before retiring a year-and-a-half-ago. Public education is one of the issues he\'s most passionate about.\""That\'s one of the things that disappointed me during both his campaign, when I think he came out really negative about public education, and in his inauguration,\"" says Brian.He retrieves a note from his pocket. A quote from Trump\'s inauguration speech is scribbled on it:\""An education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.\""\""That bothered me,\"" Brian says. \""That really, really, bothered me.\""You ask Mr. Doan if we have an education system flush with cash,\"" he adds, referring to the Effingham Unit 40 school superintendent. \""I don\'t think we do.\""Brian has also been bothered by Trump\'s comments about women, a disabled reporter, and the use of nuclear weapons.\""Of course you know the one statement, with \'grabbing the ...\' That bothered me,\"" he says. \""When he came out talking about the disabled reporter and made fun of that guy. When there was a protestor at a demonstration and, I\'m paraphrasing, \'Beat him up. I\'ll pay the legal bill.\' That stuff bothers me. Or when he said, \'How many nukes do we have here? Why don\'t we use them?\' I really hope he has enough people working for him to temper some of the comments he makes.\""Brian\'s background as science teacher colors his perception of the president\'s views on the environment.\""I don\'t think he took much account of the research scientists ... especially when it comes to climate change,\"" he says. \""That\'s a long-term problem, and I didn\'t think Mr. Trump took long-term views of much of anything.\""He supports \""responsible\"" gun control.\""I think background checks need to be tougher,\"" he says. \""If you\'re just a normal person, taking the courses and stuff and doing what you\'re supposed to do, a law-abiding citizen, whatever, if you pass everything, OK.\""I don\'t like these magazines that hold all these rounds,\"" he adds. \""I don\'t like military weapons in the civilian population.\""Church and GunsThe group of coffee drinkers near Beecher City meets every day, as long as the Buzzards\' garage door is open.\""If they\'re shut, then that means we\'ve gone to a doctor or something and then they go on down the road to Virgil\'s,\"" explains Dallas.Sunday is reserved for church-going. Some in the group head to Kaskaskia Church or the Methodist Church in Beecher City, others to one in nearby Cowden, or the Church of Christ in Effingham.\""We never could get along,\"" Bruce Kessler quips about their church affiliations.<br />\""We\'re diversified,\"" adds his wife, Mary Jo.Regardless of religious affiliation, they all look askance at a push to remove \""In God We Trust\"" from a government building in Wentzville, Missouri. They recall a woman speaking on television in favor of its removal.\""She wasn\'t making any sense,\"" says Mary Jo. \""But she wanted that removed and didn\'t think any place should have anything about God on it - our currency, or anything.\""And I thought, \'Where have you been?\' This constitution was built by our forefathers, who spoke that God is supposed to be intertwined in this government. And it\'s not had that, I mean it has, but it\'s getting farther and farther away.\""\""And then the guns!\"" she suddenly exclaims, drawing a few knowing chuckles from her friends. \""We believe in guns.\""\""They\'d love to take them away,\"" says Sherry Buzzard.Bruce and Mary Jo Kessler say they have reason to stand firmly in support of the right to bear arms. In 2008, their home was invaded by two men.\""One had a gun and one had a knife,\"" Bruce recalls. \""And it wound up they was going to take all our jewelry, money, anything of value. They put me down on the floor and Mary Jo on the floor and had a knife to her throat.\""And the steel off the barrel of that gun was up against the back of my head, and believe me, I was doing a lot of praying. I just asked for a moment to equalize it, and God gave it to me.\""Bruce told one of the men to feed his dog some lunch meat. When the man went to the refrigerator, Bruce could see that he didn\'t have a gun.\""So I bounded into my bedroom, where I had the gun,\"" Bruce says. \""And he said I made a big mistake and at that time he pried open the door and I kind of had it blocked and once he saw I had the gun, the game was over.\""Gun control? The Buzzards and Kesslers aren\'t fans of the idea.\""If they\'re used right, they don\'t hurt a thing,\"" Bruce says. \""It ain\'t the gun that actually does the damage, it\'s somebody behind them.\""Dallas attends the local Tea Party meetings at the Culver\'s fast food restaurant in Effingham.He also mails out sample ballots ahead of elections, with a voter guide attached.The voter guide portion is put together by the Illinois Family Institute, and includes the message, \""Boldly bringing biblical principles to public policy in the Land of Lincoln.\""It lists 12 questions or issues that range from the banning of counseling for minors \""who suffer from unwanted same-sex attraction and gender dysphoria,\"" to last year\'s state income tax increase, defunding Planned Parenthood, Medicaid-funded abortions, and sanctuary state status.<br />It tells voters which statewide candidates support or oppose each issue.Common ground?In the 2016 general election, nearly 75 percent of registered voters turned out in Effingham and Shelby Counties, a whopping number that underscores the passions that race generated.But in other elections, the turnout has typically been much lower.\""You\'d like to have more people vote, but people make choices,\"" says Brian Poelker, the Heartville Democrat. \""You choose to vote, you choose not to vote. That\'s your choice. It\'s the way it goes.\""Brian and the Buzzards certainly have different views. But they seem to share some common ground.For example, both frown upon big money in politics and think the state\'s 8,000 units of government could be consolidated.\""I think that stuff needs to be looked at,\"" says Brian. \""Illinois has got more units of government and school districts and all the other than any of the other states - and probably more than several states put together, in some cases.\""\""When you get million and billionaires in there, then they can put out ads that are lies,\"" says Dallas. \""Let\'s don\'t call them untruthful or deceitful, let\'s call them lies.\""The Buzzards and Poelker also think there should be more compromise and less gridlock on the national level and in Illinois, where a two-and-a-half-year budget impasse finally came to an end last summer at the cost of a controversial income tax increase.\""I think people in government need to sit down and look at, \'We\'ve got this problem, what can we do to solve it?\' and I think discussions like that need to be ongoing,\"" says Brian.\""I guess I\'m partial or biased, but it seems to me like the Democrats\' idea of compromise is doing it their way,\"" says Dallas.He also casts a wary eye on some Republicans. More than two dozen broke with Republican Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner last year to approve the income tax increase, which Rauner opposed. Dallas and others call them \""RINOS,\"" or \""Republicans In Name Only.\""\""Cavaletto is gone,\"" Dallas says, referring to John Cavaletto, R-Salem, who initially voted for the tax increase and has chosen not to seek re-election. \""He voted wrong, so he\'s out the door.\""Rauner himself has lost the support of Dallas. The governor won the state by just over 50 percent of the vote in 2014. In Shelby County, he took over 70 percent of the vote from Democrat Pat Quinn and nearly 77 percent in Effingham County.Things have changed in the minds of some voters. Rauner signed legislation allowing sanctuary cities and Medicaid-covered abortion.\""That\'s why I could never vote for Rauner again,\"" says Dallas. \""Someday I might be judged. Well, I know I\'ll be judged. And I don\'t know if God will say, \'Were you a part of killing babies or not?\' Or, \'What did you do to not encourage it?\'\""Abortion may be the issue that those who gather for glazed doughnuts at the Buzzard table are most passionate about. Many say it\'s the thing that no longer permits them to vote for any Democrat.\""I used to,\"" admits Virgil Buzzard. \""I used to a lot. Both ways. I went for the guy.\""The others nod.\""Depending on what they stood for,\"" says Virgil\'s wife, Vicki.\""It seems like they all backed Obama, and as far as I\'m concerned, he\'s a communist,\"" adds Virgil.\""It\'s the platform,\"" says Sherry Buzzard. \""If the Democrats are for abortion, they\'re all that way.\""\""It\'s right in the Democrats\' platform, a woman can kill her own baby anytime she wants to and she needs help paying for it,\"" Dallas says. \""Now that\'s in the Democrat party platform.\""\""Which means we pay for it,\"" says Sherry. \""We\'re paying for a baby to be killed.\""Lincoln Day DinnerDallas, Virgil, Bruce, and Mary Jo attended Effingham County\'s Lincoln Day Dinner on March 4, which featured Rauner and his GOP opponent in the March 20 Illinois primary, State Rep. Jeanne Ives, R-Wheaton.\""Like many of you, I helped elect Bruce Rauner,\"" Ives told the local crowd. \""I believed him when he said he had no social agenda. I believed him when he said he was going to be the conservative reform governor and take on the political ruling class. And then very quickly, I became disappointed.\""The Buzzard brothers planned to vote for Ives.\""He\'s a Democrat,\"" Virgil says of Rauner. \""He\'s not a conservative.\""\""A wolf in sheep\'s clothing,\"" adds Mary Jo.\""He might as well get on his Harley and leave the state of Illinois,\"" Bruce suggests.Contact Keith Stewart at keith.stewart@effinghamdailynews.com[1] or 217-347-7151, ext. 132.<br />References^ keith.stewart@effinghamdailynews.com (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGm2heetnLMNe-gmBnUkM5zy9qqnQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779850301634&ei=9zK_WuC-NMTIWNiHiKgI&url=http://www.effinghamdailynews.com/news/local_news/a-sea-of-red-in-a-state-of-blue/article_41cc4dfd-42e7-5747-a51b-71c70ec0c502.html,EN,,31/03/2018 07:01,2018-03-30 23:02:52+00:00,6df579530d,Effingham Daily News,,,,,1522458172,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ff62c11df1,"Antibiotics In China, Local Practice Turns Global Health Menace - Worldcrunch","Antibiotics In China, Local Practice Turns Global Health MenaceWorldcrunch<br />ZHAOQING - On a pig farm near Zhaoqing, in south-western China, dozens of lifeless pigs float in the murky, stinking waters of a pond surrounded by banana trees and vegetable patches. One of the animals is still struggling, assailed by a school of catfish. Ahead, still visible in the fading daylight, is a row of seven buildings with slanted roofs at the foot of a lush hillside, where more than a thousand sows and their piglets are kept.<br />What happens inside is a secret as access is restricted. But there are signs to indicate dubious practices. Dead or ailing piglets are thrown into the pond, even though it\'s illegal to do so. It is quicker and cheaper. A few dozen meters away, a sow lies on a mud track, awaiting the arrival of the insurance firm that must make its assessment.<br />This is one of hundreds of pig farms set up in recent years in Zhaoqing following a shift away from the provincial capital, Guangzhou (also known as Canton), where such facilities were deemed too polluting. The arrival of the farms has altered the local landscape. Bulldozers are now at work widening a strip of red earth to clear space for a second road.<br />Ying Guang-Guo, a professor at the Canton Geochemistry Institute tasked with overseeing the province\'s big cities, has arrived with his team to study this newly polluted zone. But his biggest concern is an invisible danger, namely the large amounts of antibiotics[1] contained in pig excrements flowing into the pond. The farm\'s young manager, the son of a Communist Party member, is evasive. He initially claims to use antibiotics only when sows are pregnant. But then he admits using authorized products on sick animals.<br />Our scientist grins behind his glasses as he listens. He is 52 but looks younger. And he doesn\'t believe a word he hears. In fact, he tells us, the farm probably uses about 5 kilograms of antibiotics a year, a considerable amount, and through procedures that are likely illegal.<br />The government recently published a list of pharmaceutical products authorized only with prescription, and presumably destined only for sick animals. This includes Colistin, used for people as a last resort. But as I was writing this report, Colistin could be readily purchased on Alibaba[2], China\'s leading online store, allowing people to buy them as they please. Indiscriminate use<br />Abusing antibiotics in animal farming is common in China. To supply meat[3] to a population of over 1.4 billion, animals are raised, as elsewhere, on an industrial scale, in restricted spaces and with sanitary conditions that weaken their health. In order to prevent illnesses and reduce mortality, farmers stuff them preventively with antibiotics mixed into their food. The antibiotics also hasten animal growth, adding a further incentive. This particularly concerns pig farms, but also numerous duck and fish ponds located alongside the highway linking Canton and Zhaoqing.<br />The life of these antibiotics does not end here, as waste waters channel them into streams, rivers and lakes. Our pig farm pond, which spills over when it rains abundantly, \""contains a lot of it,\"" says our researcher, who collects mud samples from lakes and waterways across the country. <br />There is no regulation in China, he says, on treating waste-waters from farms. As filtering systems are expensive, many small farmers pour their wastewater directly into rivers. The farm we visited had just installed a purification system in a building near the water, which was being tested. But the rather simple mechanism could not cleanse the water completely of antibiotics. Only 20% of Chinese farms use these simple systems, the Canton Geochemistry Institute found in a paper published last May.<br />Abusing antibiotics in animal farming is common in China, especially in pig farms - Photo: Paula Bronstein/TNS/ZUMA[4]<br />This was the first in-depth study on the presence of antibiotics in China\'s environment. The results were shocking. It revealed \""alarming\"" consumption levels and a \""relatively high\"" concentration in nature, especially in the three regions with the most people and farms: Canton and the Pearl River delta, the Yangtze delta region[5], and Beijing and Tianjin in the north.<br />Deadly resistance<br />China, which has a fifth of the world\'s population, consumes half the antibiotics produced worldwide. The country ingested 162,000 tons in 2013, divided about equally between animals (52%) and people (48%). \""It\'s a big educational problem,\"" says Ying Guang-Guo. \""The Chinese have very little information on how to use antibiotics.\"" Doctors prescribe them merrily and people can get them without prescription in small clinics (though hospitals are stricter). <br />This overuse has become a health threat. Bacteria naturally develop resistance to the antibiotics they absorb, but with massive use \""in the past 10 years, resistance by some bacteria has risen fast [in China] and is now above levels seen on average throughout the planet,\"" says Ying Guang-Guo.<br />The evidence is that the mcr-1 gene, resistant to the most potent antibiotic Colistin and able to go from one bacterium to another, was first spotted in China in 2015 before appearing in the United States. If nothing is done, so-called \""super bug\"" infections could kill up to 10 million people a year by 2050, Britain\'s Review on Antimicrobial Resistance[6] has found. <br />Yin Guang-Guo adds that antibiotics can create a vicious circle of pollution[7] affecting both food sources and drinking water. Researchers at the Canton Institute measuring the use and discharge of the main 36 antibiotics in 2013 estimated that about 54,000 tons of antibiotics made it into the country\'s waters.<br />Around 80% came from animal, especially pig and poultry farms. Even if its study has yet to find a conclusive link between this and increased germ resistance, \""antibiotic pollutants have a negative impact on the ecosystem,\"" says Yin Guang-Guo, adding this would inevitably affect our health.<br />Another study by the University of Fudan, cited in the Chinese press, suggests that children in Shanghai and in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were frequently exposed to small doses of antibiotics found in their food and environment. Traces have been found in the urine of almost 60% of children. Some of the antibiotics detected have been out of use for decades.<br />Solving the problem requires greater public awareness, stricter rules for doctors and small clinics and better water treatment. But to deal with so-called super bugs, there also needs to be research into new antibiotics.

ff6e34d815,Simpler technique yields antibodies to a range of infectious agents - Arizona State University,"Simpler technique yields antibodies to a range of infectious agents<br />Antibodies, (seen in green, red and orange) bind with specific membrane proteins present on the cell surface. Graphic by Jason Drees/Biodesign Institute<br />Download Full Image[1]<br />\""We learned that our new process of antibody production is incredibly efficient. If the membrane protein is naturally immunogenic, we easily generated high levels of antibodies using the genes alone,\"" Hansen (pictured below) said. \""Rather than laboriously purifying the membrane protein and attempting to maintain the proper protein structure within detergents prior to immunization, we let the immunized host do the work for us.\"" <br />The new study also describes a method for expressing and purifying membrane proteins in a test tube and examining their binding activities with specific antibodies in blood extracted from gene-immunized mice.<br />Conventionally, producing an immune response to a foreign protein requires purification of the protein, which is then injected into an animal. The process is cumbersome, challenging and time consuming. In the current study, an immune response is instead produced by directly introducing a gene encoding the protein of interest.<br />Two of the membrane proteins produced in the study were also successfully introduced into membranes of the bacterium E. coli, through the process of recombinant DNA. Use of the specific antibodies present in blood from gene-immunized mice demonstrated for the first time that both membrane proteins could be recombinantly expressed in a live organism, correctly fold into proper 3-D structures and migrate to the membranes within E. coli. These results now facilitate the structural determination of these two critical virulence proteins.<br />The research, which appears in the current issue of the Nature Publishing Group journal Scientific Reports[2], promises to deliver new insights into the structure and function of membrane proteins of critical importance for medicine.<br />On the surface<br />Membrane proteins are implicated in innumerable functions in living organisms including cell signaling and communication, energy conversion and utilization, molecular transport and catalysis. Due to their involvement in a range of diseases, they have recently become primary targets for a new range of therapeutics. Indeed, more than 50 percent of all therapeutic targets are membrane proteins. The number is expected to rise as more is learned about membrane protein structure and function.<br />Despite their important role as the molecular interface in host/pathogen interactions as well as drug/cell relationships, membrane proteins account for less than 1 percent of the 100,000 unique protein structures presently catalogued. This is largely due to the serious challenges involved in producing, purifying and determining the structures of membrane proteins. Hansen and her colleagues outline new strategies to produce antibodies - specialized proteins produced naturally by the immune system in response to pathogens or other threatening biological agents.<br />In the current study, they describe the use of a gene gun to introduce DNA information into a mouse. The handheld device uses a burst of gas to propel gold particles impregnated with circular DNAs known as plasmids into the skin in mice. The gold particles are known as micronanoplexes. The gene gun technology was pioneered and developed by Stephen A. Johnston, co-director of the Biodesign Center for Innovations in Medicine.<br />The genetic material introduced via the gene gun is taken up by mouse dendritic cells and translated into membrane protein in dermal tissues and lymph nodes. The mouse immune system responds by producing specific antibodies capable of binding to the membrane proteins. While the basic technique of genetic immunization has been in use for some time, the study marks the first description of the broad applicability of this approach to membrane proteins, as well as the first application of DNA-gold micronanoplexes to stimulate antibody production.<br />Bacterial and viral menaces examined<br />Results showed that genetic immunization successfully produced antibodies specific to 12 out of 17 membrane proteins from two Biosafety Level 3 pathogens: Francisella tularensis and African swine fever virus (ASFV). F. tularensis causes the disease tularemia. It is a widely studied infectious pathogen notorious for its ability to invade numerous cell types and cleverly evade the immune system. It is one of the most pathogenic bacteria on Earth, capable of causing a fatal infection with as few as 10 cells. African swine fever virus is carried by arthropods. Infection in pigs causes a lethal and untreatable hemorrhagic disease that has devastated swine populations in areas of Africa and Eastern Europe.<br />Investigations of endogenous disease proteins produced by these organisms are difficult, requiring specialized safety facilities and protocols due to the potential danger they pose to researchers. The new method described permits the production of these pathogens\' membrane proteins and associated antibodies through DNA-based approaches, permitting the safe handling of biological material without risk of infection.<br />Once antibodies to specific membrane proteins have been produced in the mouse, the group sought to characterize the resulting mouse blood or sera. To do this, a new system known as in vitro translation in the presence of hydrophobic magnetic beads (IVT-HMB) was developed. Here, a small quality of membrane protein is produced in a test tube, simultaneously extracted using hydrophobic beads, then screened against the sera extracted from gene-immunized mice. Detection of a resulting signal in two types of diagnostic tests or assays (ELISA and Western blot) established the presence in the mouse sera of antibodies specific to each membrane protein. The IVT-HMB method represents a powerful streamlining of the production of membrane proteins, precluding the arduous process of isolation and purification traditionally required.<br />Stepping-stone to protein structures<br />Using X-rays to image tiny crystals of proteins is a powerful method to determine detailed protein structure, but the technique faces many challenges, including the difficulty of producing and purifying proteins that assemble properly. The current research marks a starting point for further structural characterization of membrane proteins, using such techniques as cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography.<br />Petra Fromme, a co-author of the new study and director of the Biodesign Institute\'s Center for Applied Structural Discovery, highlights the power of the new research: \""The range of antibodies produced through techniques like genetic immunization opens the door to high-resolution molecular images of important membrane proteins,\"" she said. \""The resulting antibodies assist structural determination in a variety of important ways, identifying properly assembled proteins, helping to induce proteins to assemble with other proteins into well-ordered crystals and stabilizing or trapping proteins in active states that can be imaged using X-rays.\""<br />In the next phase of research, the group plans to produce monoclonal antibodies using the same immunization process. These are essential as co-crystallization binding factors or ligands, used for the structural determination of membrane proteins via X-ray crystallography. The authors further note that the monoclonal antibodies produced through genetic immunization techniques offer attractive candidates for future therapeutics against a broad range of diseases.<br />This study was a combined effort of faculty in the Biodesign Institute, including Debra Hansen from the Center for Innovations in Medicine (CIM), Center for Applied Structural Discovery (CASD) and the School of Molecular Sciences (SMS), Kathryn Sykes from CIM and Petra Fromme from CASD and SMS, along with their teams of researchers and students, including: research scientists Mark Robida, Andrey Loskutov and Tien Olson, researchers Felicia Craciunescu, John-Charles Rodenberry and Hetal Patel and graduate student Xiao Wang from CIM and postdoc Katerina Dörner from SMS.<br />All of the necessary clones (plasmid DNAs) for applying this approach are available through the DNASU Plasmid Repository, which is housed in Biodesign\'s Center for Personalized Diagnostics.<br />This work was funded by the NIH (NIGMS) under the PSI:Biology program, as part of the MPID (Membrane Proteins in Infectious Diseases) U54 grant, directed by Petra Fromme.<br />References^ Download Full Image (asunow.asu.edu)^ Scientific Reports (news.google.com)<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNG7ZMIyILU01Ry3BhsXHRmVQhAWiQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779052923097&ei=uAbQVoD3AovZa5amgYgO&url=https://asunow.asu.edu/20160225-simpler-technique-yields-antibodies-range-infectious-agents,EN,,26/02/2016 08:03,2016-02-25 18:59:35+00:00,375d7e138b,Arizona State University,,,,,1456430375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

976a3539c8,Breeding goats for sale brings the cash home - Daily Nation - Daily Nation,"Breeding goats for sale brings the cash home<br />By ELIZABETH OJINAMore by this Author<br />[1]A few metres from Riat Centre in Seme, Kisumu County sits the home of Moses Omondi, who has specialised in dairy goat farming. A section of his 1.5 acres hosts four goat sheds measuring about 4 by 3 metres each.We find one of his workers finishing cleaning the sheds. Later, he takes nine lactating cows for milking at another shed.\""We don\'t mix the goats, the does stay separately and so do the bucks. We keep 34 goats in total, 15 are adult and the rest are kids,\"" says Omondi, who mainly keeps the German Alpine breed.The 39-year-old says he had an option of going for the Saanens or Toggenburgs but he did not since he couldn\'t get the genealogy of the animals he wanted from the farmers.The German Alpine breed is a moderate feeder producing two to three litres of milk on average daily, but with better management, it can even hit four litres. <br />\""I get 18 litres of milk a day from the nine goats. Each produces between two to three litres a day that I sell for Sh90 a litres,\"" says the farmer, who sells the milk to local residents.Unfortunately, people in the region do not appreciate the value of goat milk. \""So I ensure I take good care of the kids well which I sell later getting some good income. I sell young bucks when they are seven to 12 months old at Sh20,000 for breeding purposes,\"" says Omondi, who has registered his animals with Kenya Stud Books, where he also gets high quality pedigree bucks for his breeding business.COMFORTABLE IN THE DRY AREAOn the other hand, in-calf does which are on demand in HomaBay, Vihiga, Kakamega, Siaya and Kisumu counties go for Sh25,000.He feeds his animals on napier grass and shrubs such as lucerne, acacia, calliandra and desmodium thrice a day. He also mixes nutritious salt licks in water.\""The bulk of the feed are the shrubs which are locally available, cutting the cost of production in the intensive zero-grazing system,\"" says the father of two.Omondi started the venture in February 2008 after paying a visit to a dairy goat farm in Embu. He bought two does and a buck at Sh20,000 each.\""I went for goats because they could live comfortably in this area, which is dry. I then set up the sheds which cost Sh50,000,\"" says Omondi, who has two employees and lost two animals to pneumonia when he was starting.Pneumonia is an acute illness that renders an animal too weak to feed and dies in 72 hours if treatment is not offered.The disease is caused by poor hygiene and bad structures that expose the goats to harsh weather. Symptoms include general body weakness, cough, hyperpnea and nasal discharge accompanied by fever. One should quarantine the affected flock and treat them immediately.<br />Related Stories<br />Fri Dec 19 19:50:35 EAT 2014<br />Juma started the venture with 30 indigenous goats but he realised they were uneconomical.<br />The sleuths from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commissions (EACC) were in search of documents<br />The 2016 election cycle pitting the Republican nominee against the former secretary of state has<br />References^ More by this Author (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHf2n5U4-rU7YXI3m3zkPLUcn_MPA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779248621722&ei=-gcLWIriFo_WzAbE1aLAAw&url=http://www.nation.co.ke/business/seedsofgold/Breeding-goats-for-sale-brings-the-cash-home/2301238-3425140-8wgaul/,EN,,22/10/2016 07:02,2016-10-21 15:35:10+00:00,2149121cdb,Daily Nation,,,,,1477071310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is because medical opinion does not currently support reducing the age of viability below 24 weeks.<br />\""We fully understand that some parents whose baby was born dead before 24 weeks find it very distressing that they cannot register the birth. However, it is important to recognise that there are also many parents who would be distressed if they had to register the birth in this way.<br />\""We acknowledge that whatever the definition of stillbirth is, there will be those who fall just below it. Therefore, there will always be some parents who find this definition to be an additional source of distress at a deeply painful time. Sands is concerned that any changes to the way in which stillborn babies are registered (for example by issuing a birth and death certificate instead of a certificate of stillbirth) would make it harder to monitor stillbirth trends and causes.<br />\""At Sands, we know from the many thousands of parents we support that having keepsakes of their baby is very important to them. When a life is so short, there are few opportunities for creating memories. Sands, therefore, encourages all hospitals to offer the option of a Certificate of Birth to parents of all babies who are born dead before 24 weeks.

An investigation has been launched into how the incident took place. <br />A teenager has been killed after he was accidentally shot in the head by his grandfather during a hunting trip on the opening weekend of France\'s season (stock image)The boy\'s death is the second to take place on the opening weekend of France\'s hunting season after a 57-year-old man was killed when he fell into a ravine in the country\'s south western Alpes-Maritimes region on Saturday.And in the Var region, in the south east, another man and his 12-year-old son were injured when they were hit by stray bullets. Their injuries were not fatal.The incidents will likely fuel campaigns for a change in France\'s hunting laws.The head of the Association for the Protection of Wild Animals (APWA), Pierre Athanaze, told The Local[3] previously: \'Hunting needs to be stopped on Sundays, because this is the most dangerous day. \'There are more and more people heading out into the countryside on a Sunday, whether it\'s for walking, mountain biking or collecting mushrooms.

976299a601,Scientist on mission to save endangered antelope in Kenya :: Kenya ... - The Standard (press release),"Scientist on mission to save endangered antelope in Kenya :: Kenya<br />Hirola, the world\'s most endangered antelope.You may not know that Kenya  is home to the hirola, the world\'s most endangered antelope found nowhere else on earth today, having been virtually cleared in neighbouring Somalia where incessant conflicts exposed them to extreme danger.<br />Popularly referred to by scientists as \'living fossils\' because of their small numbers, the remaining 500 or so mostly beige (hirola is Somali for beige) shy, slender, antelope distinguished by their long faces and distinctly ringed horns  that reach up to 70 centimeters (28 inches in length) are the only link between the genus Beatragus antelopes and extinction.<br />Hirola\'s unmatched distinction is perhaps most pronounced by enlarged pre-orbital glands beneath its eyes giving it a unique \'four eyes\' or bespectacled look absent in all other antelope species. A white line or chevron passes from one eye to the other across the animal\'s slightly convex forehead.<br />According to Dr. Abdullah Hussein Ali, an ecologist with the National Museums of Kenya who has dedicated much of his time researching on the rare ungulates to secure their dwindling natural habitat in an effort to salvage them from extinction, the hirola has been listed as one of the \'Top 100\' Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) mammal in dire need of enhanced conservation attention.<br />He says if the hirola joins the Dodo, a flightless Mauritian bird hunted to extinction about 300 years ago, it  would go down as the first mammal genus in Africa to disappear from the surface of the earth and only the second in the world since Australia\'s Tasmanian wolf in 1936.<br />What has contributed to the graceful hirola\'s dwindling numbers from approximately 17,000 in the 1970s to just over 500 today?<br />ALSO READ:<br />Woman trampled to death by rogue elephant[1]<br />The pain on Ali\'s face is palpable. \""Habitat loss stemming from the extirpation of elephants, overgrazing by livestock, fire suppression lead to  nearly 251% increase in tree cover according to Ali\'s recent research published in the Journal of Applied Ecology. This subsequently led to decline of grasses that hirola and cattle depends on.  Additionally, frequent drought in the hirola\'s geographic range also favored trees over grasses<br />Researcher Dr. Ali at work in the wild. (Photo: Courtesy)\""In particular  a 98 per cent decline in elephant numbers throughout hirola geographic range in North Eastern Kenya might have triggered tree encroachment,\"" he says, quoting research findings that elephant numbers in North Eastern region  have dropped from 7,725 in 1978 to less than 100 today, hindering the maintenance of grasslands on which hirola and other grazing animals depend.<br />\""It has been established that overgrazing reduces fuel loads that subsequently reduce fire frequency,\"" he says and explains that fires and elephants kill shrubs that hamper the growth of short grasses on which hirola feed.<br /> \""Fires make grasses to sprout afresh. Hirola are known to follow the progress of newly sprouting grasses on the savannah and grass lands,\"" clarifies Ali.<br />Ali says declines in hirola population have coincided with an increase in browsing livestock (goats and camels) and decrease in grazing livestock such as cattle as a coping mechanism to the landscape change and from a shift in traditional Somali nomadism to sedentary pastoralism.<br />He describes the decommissioning of Arawale national reserve, the only protected area dedicated to saving hirola due to lack of funds as regrettable because this was the only formally protected area for hirola in their entire native range.<br />More recent threats according to Ali include the   lawlessness and conflicts in hirola\'s natural habitat on the plains along the Kenya Somalia border. Not only have the animals been killed by individuals with illegal firearms including Al Shabaab bandits, a swelling Kamba population with an irresistible urge for wild meat has exacerbated the problem.<br />ALSO READ:<br />Human-wildlife conflicts rising, KWS warns[2]<br />He says the collapse of the Somalia government in 1991impacted negatively on the hirola as an influx of refugees into Kenya disrupted movement in their corridor.<br />\""With the influx and the absence of a functional government in Somalia came lawlessness that heightened poaching to near decimation of the once innumerous elephants that felled trees in their feeding, hence thinning tree cover as they roamed the thickets for food.  Their sheer presence guaranteed more open spaces suitable for grass to flourish. The hirola thrive on grasslands.<br />Ali says the hirola conservation programme in which he is engaged incorporates efforts to conserve elephants alongside manual clearing of trees and grass seedling in hirola habitats. \""This undertaking is in collaboration with international partners. We hope that besides triggering the recovery of hirola, it will   have a knock on effect on improving local livelihoods,\"" he says.<br />\""We are also educating communities on the benefits of reduced livestock herds to tackle the menace of overgrazing that has impacted adversely on the hirola,\"" says Ali.<br />What attracted him to the hirola? \""I grew up seeing these elegant creatures and I have watched them dwindle over the years. So, when confronted with a choice for my PhD dissertation work at the University of Wyoming, I quickly settled for the hirola,\"" says Ali, currently a post-doctoral fellow at Utah State University in the United States with a focus on identifying ideal conditions under which hirola habitat can be restored.<br />He says past hirola conservation has been prohibitive because of historical issues such as the Shifta war in the mid-1960s that made their geographical range a no-go zone for scientists and the perennial mayhem in Somalia.<br />\""Besides, many people view Somalis and the northern Kenya region with suspicion and are reluctant to work among them. Lack of infrastructure and negative perceptions about insecurity in Somali populated areas that are the natural hirola range have only made matters worse,\"" he laments.<br />ALSO READ:<br />The magic of Lewa[3]<br />Ali is optimistic that solutions for hirola recovery are at hand. \""It all rests with the people,\"" he says with a smile. \""Among the Somali, hirola are indicators of healthy rangelands. Local communities welcome them. We are working with these communities to find solutions that that will boost the numbers of this creature whose image appears on the seal of Garissa County Government.<br />Effervescently he adds, \""we are hopeful for the recovery of the species because we now understand the problem better and have our eyes on solutions.<br />References^ Woman trampled to death by rogue elephant (www.standardmedia.co.ke)^ Human-wildlife conflicts rising, KWS warns (www.standardmedia.co.ke)^ The magic of Lewa (www.standardmedia.co.ke)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFFjHtGR7UPpncRPIPlf9ZkkVip7g&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779419274410&ei=zIPTWIDGPIWoWo3qnOgL&url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001232512/scientist-on-mission-to-save-endangered-antelope-in-kenya,EN,,23/03/2017 08:14,2017-03-13 07:54:10+00:00,d4f07714c5,The Standard (press release),,,,,1489395250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99d8474dd6,Stronach family feud worsens as brother Andrew sues sister Belinda - Automotive News,"Stronach family feud worsens as brother Andrew sues sister Belinda<br />Belinda and Frank Stronach. Photo credit: Donald Weber/Getty Images via Bloomberg<br />The family feud that\'s tearing apart one of Canada\'s richest families is getting nastier.<br />Former Magna International CEO Belinda Stronach -- already the target of a $397 million lawsuit filed by her billionaire father Frank Stronach -- is now being sued by her brother Andrew. He says he\'s lost trust in Belinda and wants her removed from a family trust and replaced by his father.<br />The suit claims Belinda and trustees \""have undertaken a number of improvident and costly investments that have resulted in significant losses.\"" As a result, \""the Stronach Group now finds itself in a liquidity crisis and is actively attempting to sell off valuable real estate and other assets.\""<br />Andrew Stronach\'s lawsuit, filed Nov. 1 in Toronto, is the latest twist in an increasingly bitter dispute that erupted after Frank Stronach left Canada in 2013 for a brief foray into politics in his native Austria -- handing control over a key trust to his daughter, now 52, and trustees such as Alon Ossip, a former Magna executive.<br />Since November 2013, the lawsuit says, Belinda Stronach has controlled various trusts and companies that form the Stronach Group and hold most of the wealth created by the Magna founder. Andrew, whom the lawsuit says \""has dedicated his life to agricultural pursuits,\"" owns 23 percent of the Stronach Group through his own trust.<br />This year, as the dispute intensified, Andrew made numerous attempts to obtain \""a proper accounting\"" for the trust -- such as the three most recent financial statements.<br />\""To date, Andrew\'s proper and reasonable requests for information have been ignored, or only partially answered after lengthy delays and following repeated requests for disclosure,\"" according to the lawsuit filed with the Ontario Superior Court.<br />{{title}}<br />{{abstract}}<br />Read more ><br />{{/content}}<br />\'Complete breakdown\'<br />As a result of Belinda\'s conduct, \""there has been a complete breakdown in trust and confidence\"" between Andrew, his parents and the so-called \""Belinda trustees,\"" according to the lawsuit. \""Andrew has no confidence in the willingness or ability of the Belinda trustees to discharge properly, or at all, their duties as trustees.\""<br />No statement of defense against either lawsuit has yet been filed.<br />\""The filing on behalf of my brother is an extension of my father\'s legal pursuit against me and my children, and the allegations remain just as untrue,\"" Belinda Stronach said in a statement Monday. \""We will be responding formally in due course. It saddens me greatly that we have reached this juncture in our family.\""<br />Paul Deegan, a spokesman for Ossip, called the claims \""wholly without merit. Mr. Stronach and his lawyers have been provided with detailed financials of the trusts and subsidiary corporations. They have also been offered access repeatedly to key individuals in the organization to answer any questions and provide additional information. This is a Stronach family dispute that should be resolved by the family.\""<br />In the original suit, Frank Stronach, 86, claims Belinda is starving his grass-fed cattle farm of financing, selling off assets over his objections while using company funds to bankroll an extravagant lifestyle of parties, vacations and limousine rides.<br />Magna origins<br />Frank Stronach, who built Magna into a global auto-parts giant from a one-man shop, and his wife Elfriede say their relationship with their daughter has suffered a \""complete breakdown.\"" The lawsuit against her is a \""last resort\"" after trying for 20 months to find a settlement, according to a 73-page statement of claim filed in a Toronto court on Oct. 1.<br />The couple are seeking C$520 million ($397 million U.S.) in compensation from Belinda, Ossip and her two adult children, Nicole and Frank Walker, whose father Don Walker is the current CEO of Magna. They want Belinda and Ossip removed from the management of various family companies and trusts.<br />Key to the lawsuit are what Frank and his wife say were \""covert\"" and \""unlawful\"" actions to appropriate family assets from at least 2011 until November 2016 -- when the suit says Belinda and Ossip took the view that Frank was no longer in control of the family empire.<br />\""Belinda and Alon have asserted control over the Stronach Group in an oppressive manner and have taken steps to shut the rest of the Stronach family out of the family\'s business,\"" Frank\'s says in the suit.<br />Hormone free<br />Frank Stronach\'s post-Magna life has included a stint as a member of parliament in his native Austria from late 2013 to early 2014, the development of Adena Farms, a Florida-based agricultural business dedicated to producing hormone-free, grass-fed beef and a golf and country club in Florida that included restaurants serving all-natural foods. Stronach is worth about $1.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.<br />After demanding that Frank \""take immediate steps to rein in or terminate\'\' expenditures associated with Adena and other ventures, Belinda and Ossip moved to \""impair, undermine and dismantle\"" the agricultural businesses -- cutting off funding, canceling leases and laying off employees, according to the Oct. 1 suit. As a result, Adena Farms has been \""placed in a precarious position and may never reach its full potential.\""<br />Separately, the suit alleges Belinda, who ran Magna from 2001 to 2004, has appropriated more than $70 million to maintain her lifestyle over the years, \""routinely\'\' asking to be reimbursed for \""hundreds of thousands of dollars\'\' of personal expenses -- including parties, vacations, limousine rides, and expensive meals.<br />That included the C$10 million purchase and refurbishment of a personal office in Toronto -- at a time when the Stronach group was suffering from liquidity issues, an \""irresponsible\"" and \""extravagant\"" move when Magna and related companies already have offices nearby in Aurora, Ontario.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH_WiyrwYA2ZGAl1eDZ5RdYUaKE_g&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=dZ3iW8iyEdH8zAaJzaP4Ag&url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20181106/COPY01/311069949/stronach-family-feud-worsens-as-brother-andrew-sues-sister-belinda,EN,,07/11/2018 08:07,2018-11-06 13:19:00+00:00,51fe179e08,Automotive News,,,,,1541513940,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99d97828cf,Inside Japan\'s racehorse breeding empire - The Japan Times,"Inside Japan\'s racehorse breeding empire<br />Harry Sweeney has his hand up a horse\'s backside. The mare looks put out by this intrusion. Her eyes dart about nervously and she shifts her weight before accepting five thick human digits probing her insides. After feeling the uterus and the swelling of the ovaries, Sweeney\'s arm, slick with mucus and excrement, reemerges. He doesn\'t even need to look at the monitor. \""She\'s pregnant,\"" he confirms, smiling.<br />As well he might. Foals bred on Sweeney\'s Hokkaido farm, Paca Paca (the onomatopoeic sound of a trotting horse), have sold for more than $1 million (¥102 million). In 2012, Deep Brillante, born on this farm, won the Japanese Derby, the country\'s most prestigious race. Sweeney later sold her sister for $1.79 million. The clump of cells inside the belly of this timorous mare could one day be worth a pile of cash.<br />Given the high stakes, owners strive to improve the odds by employing the services of proven winners. Deep Impact, one of Japan\'s best-loved and most famous racehorses, is also one of the country\'s leading live sperm donors. Hundreds of times a year, the stallion is trundled off from his home in a farm a few hours from Paca Paca to inseminate another unsuspecting mare. If this union produces a foal, Deep Impact\'s owner, Katsumi Yoshida, is rewarded with ¥30 million. So successful has the thoroughbred been that Deep Impact is currently earning ¥6 trillion (almost $60 million) a year. And at 14 - middle-aged for a horse - the stallion is still young enough to sire hundreds more children, as long as the spirit - and the body - is willing.<br />Not every horse performs on cue. Breeding is a hit-and-miss affair: foals can turn out to be sickly or deformed. Mares and stallions can be temperamental, or worse: One of America\'s most iconic racehorses, Cigar, won almost $10 million in prize money and was twice voted horse of the year in the 1990s. However, his performance on racecourses was not matched in the stable: None of the 34 mares he squired became pregnant. Cigar, it turned out, was shooting blanks.<br />Racing utopia<br />Horse racing in Japan appears at first glance to have its best days behind it: Attendance at racecourses is down by more than half from the 14 million people who went in the late 1990s, when betting revenue peaked.<br />Yet, the domestic industry is still big business, with annual betting turnover of more than $25 billion (about twice that spent in the United States) and some of the more prestigious races and richest purses in the world.<br />Not bad for a country where gambling is, with noted exceptions, illegal.<br />The country\'s most popular race, the Japan Cup, regularly attracts more than 100,000 people to Tokyo Racecourse in Fuchu, one of the planet\'s largest stadiums. The nation\'s online betting system has 3.4 million subscribers, according to the Japan Racing Association (JRA). One estimate is that a fifth of the bets placed on horses in the world are made in Japan. \""It\'s a kind of racing utopia,\"" Sweeney concludes.<br />Most strikingly of all has been the evolution of breeding over the past two decades. From being largely also-rans in international competition, Japan-bred horses are now among the fastest and strongest in the world, thanks largely to mixing with foreign bloodlines (see sidebar). American horses, once the ones to beat, haven\'t won the Japan Cup since 1991. The last time the race was won by a horse from outside Japan was more than a decade ago.<br />Japan-bred horses not only dominate the domestic sport, they increasingly win abroad too. Instead of Kildare or Kentucky, elite breeders send mares to Hokkaido to mate with Japanese stallions.<br />This success hasn\'t been achieved without controversy. Like anywhere, only a fraction of the horses bred will ever have the star power of a Deep Impact; tired stallions are injected with testosterone to get them back in the mood, claim animal rights groups. And once stud fees fall, life can end with a trip to the butcher\'s yard.<br />One each way<br />Despite - or perhaps because of - these riches, the industry is famously strictly run. The JRA, a public company, operates Tokyo Racecourse and the rest of the country\'s largest tracks. It licenses trainers, vets and jockeys, runs betting shops and the country\'s two big training centers.<br />Acting under the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the JRA sends 10 percent of its annual turnover (about $2.48 billion) back to the government coffers. Legislation dictates that the money must be used to pay for livestock breeding, and public and social welfare.<br />The quasi-government control has mostly kept the sport out of the hands of gangsters, conmen and illegal syndicates. It is also the \""great difference\"" between Japan and other parts of the world, says Hiroshi Ito, head of the JRA\'s International Planning Division.<br />Elsewhere, he points out, betting shops, courses, races and training farms are often run separately.<br />\""In the United States, racecourse ownership is (organized) by states; each racecourse in America is for profit and they have to compete against each other,\"" Ito says. Profits generated in Japan are plowed back to the facilities, breeders and trainers. In the long term, that improves the industry.\""<br />Visitors to Japan are often stunned by what they see on the biggest racetracks. In addition to the sometimes obsessive fans who follow particular horses and riders, families and young couples crowd the biggest races. The bread-and-butter of the industry is the paltry ¥200 entry price paid into courses and the small wagers made by millions of ordinary punters (two-thirds of the bets are made online or on smartphones).<br />\""(There is) a reverence for the horse and for the sport that hasn\'t existed in the West for decades,\"" wrote Ryan Goldberg, an American journalist in December 2014.<br />The reverence does not extend to what happens after the animals have outlived their usefulness. About 90 percent of former racehorses in Japan end up in slaughterhouses every year, according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The victims include some of the biggest stars, says PETA, including Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, who was \""disposed of,\"" aged 19, in 2002.<br />\""They are killed, cut apart and end up as food for dogs and humans,\"" PETA claims.<br />Ito says the JRA and farms in the private sector have retraining programs to help retired racehorses become riding horses. He notes, however, that such programs don\'t cover every racehorse in the country.<br />Many fans like to believe their equine heroes have been put out to pasture but the industry shares little of their romanticism.<br />\""It\'s a fact of life that 5,000 to 7,000 racehorses come into the world every year and they have to leave,\"" Sweeney says. \""The most important thing for me is that it\'s done as humanely as possible. The lives of sheep, pigs, dogs and horses are all equally valuable.\""<br />Foreign racehorse breeder tastes industry success<br />A quarter of a century ago, Harry Sweeney was a horse doctor in Ireland when he was asked to bring his veterinarian skills to Hokkaido.<br />\""(It was) very dark days for the Irish economy,\"" recalls Sweeney, 55. His main interest in attending the interview in Dublin, however, was not the prospect of a new job but a night in posh accommodation.<br />\""There were very few five-star hotels in Ireland at the time and I thought it would be the only opportunity I\'d ever get to stay in one,\"" he says, laughing at the memory. When his future Japanese employers promised him six times his then-salary to become a farm manager, however, he took the offer. He and his wife, Anne, found themselves in Hokkaido\'s snowy farmland. Their few neighbors spoke little English.<br />It was, says Sweeney, \""tough\"": no internet, cellphones or satellite TV. The Japan Times regularly arrived five days late; he had to follow the 1991 Gulf War with a shortwave radio stuck to his ear.<br />Still, the couple enjoyed the adventure and stayed on for five years before moving to a larger farm. They studied Japanese and had four children, all boys.<br />Eventually, opportunity knocked again. In the go-go years of the 1980s, wealthy Japanese bought trophy foreign mares, along with golf courses, skyscrapers and film studios. As the economy tanked in the 1990s, Sweeney thought some might be willing to sell.<br />\""I remember thinking \'I will broker these mares for repatriation and get a fine commission for it,\'\"" he recalls.<br />That was Sweeney\'s entry into the racehorse business, and his battle with the forces that control it. He began buying foals, rearing them and putting them up for auction in the United States. It was a gamble, he admits.<br />\""We had some spectacular success and some frightening losses,\"" he says.<br />All was going reasonably well until he turned up with $20,000 at a Japanese auction to buy a racehorse.<br />There was \""total pandemonium,\"" recalls Sweeney. After nine years in Japan, he had snagged a bureaucratic tripwire: No foreign national had ever been allowed to buy a racehorse in his own name.<br />\""I was apoplectic and demanded to know why,\"" he recalls.<br />The bottom line, he was told, was that racehorse owners were required to own farms ... but foreign nationals were banned from holding agricultural land.<br />\""Conventional wisdom was that it was impossible for a foreigner to own a farm, and to become a racehorse owner,\"" he says. \""I started to investigate and saw a way around it - not to buy the farm in my own name but in the name of a Japanese registered company.\""<br />Not one to take no for an answer, Sweeney bought his farm though a legal backdoor that involved appointing two Japanese directors. Then he bulldozed his way through other obstacles, eventually winning a coveted license from the Japanese Racing Association.<br />He considers the latter his greatest achievement. The JRA, he points out, is an elite club of just 2,000 racehorse owners - and he was at the time the only non-Japanese member.<br />Sweeney\'s 225-hectare farm is a short drive from where he first began working 26 years ago. Over the years he has had some remarkable successes.<br />One of his first originated during a family trip to Ireland, when he spotted a mare galloping in the mountains and took her back to Japan. In 2001, a colt produced by the mare won one of Japan\'s most elite races. He subsequently sold a half-brother for $750,000.<br />\""We grew from there, buying better horses, better quality,\"" he says.<br />In 2012, Deep Brillante, bred on Paca Paca, won the Japanese Derby. Sweeney subsequently sold his sister for $1.79 million. Last year, eight young horses fetched more than $2 million at a single sale.<br />The Irishman finds himself at the center of an industry with betting turnover greater than the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland combined, and 24,000 horses in training - the third-largest number in the world.<br />For years, he and his family of four boys have split their time between Hokkaido and their second home in Ireland. Still, a quarter of a century after leaving home, Sweeney\'s love affair with Japan is still fresh.<br />\""I like it here; it\'s a fantastic horse industry, structure, racing and prize money,\"" Sweeney says. \""I love the farm, the scenery, people and the food. I think I have a wonderful life: a home in Ireland and a home here.\""<br />Among his innovations has been to leave yearlings (immature horses) out in the snow, a decision that raised eyebrows in the industry.<br />\""We were the first in Japan to do it,\"" he says. \""They\'re healthier; they grow better, stronger muscles.\""<br />Sweeney says that once the farm produced its first Derby winner, \""our neighbors copied us.\""<br />The \'new superpower\' of domestic horse breeder<br />The home of horse breeding in Japan is Hokkaido and its undisputed kings are the Yoshida brothers.<br />Katsumi, Teruya and Haruya Yoshida between them midwife over a fifth of the 7,000 foals born annually in Japan, and nearly half of the horses that compete in the biggest races. Rumor has it that despite their close working relationship, the brothers are at odds.<br />\""If they\'re sitting in the same room, they\'ll be on opposite sides,\"" says one insider.<br />The family patriarch, Zensuke, began racing horses in the 1930s. His son Zenya revolutionized domestic bloodlines when he imported (at a cost of about $10 million) the winner of the 1989 Kentucky Derby to breed with local mares. Sunday Silence and the Japanese horses he bred with was a gene match made in heaven. He became Japan\'s greatest stallion, helping to completely change the phenotype of Japanese horses.<br />Sunday Silence\'s offspring have won most of Japan\'s and many of the world\'s top races, according to the Japan Bloodstock Information System database. Their estimated collective earnings top ¥80 billion and include Deep Impact, which Katsumi Yoshida bred and sold for $600,000. After he won the Japanese Triple Crown in 2005, the Yoshida brothers bought him back for more than $50 million, less than what he now earns in a year from squiring foals.<br />Makahiki, also sired by Deep Impact, won the Japanese Derby in May, earning a prize of ¥200 million. The Yoshida family owns or has a stake in most of the nation\'s other top stallions, including King Kamehameha, Harbinger and Just a Way, once the world\'s top-rated thoroughbred horse. Their successes abroad include Rulership, who won the Queen Elizabeth II Cup in Hong Kong in 2012, and Gentildonna, winner of the Dubai Sheema Classic two years ago.<br />The origins of the Yoshida empire date back to 1993 when Zenya died.<br />Zenya\'s sprawling operation was divided between the brothers, with Katsumi, taking over the branch that would become the Northern Farm.<br />Katsumi\'s greatest contribution to Japanese breeding has been to scour the racehorse farms of Europe, America and Australia for quality mares, says Murray Johnson, a veteran Japan-based commentator and expert.<br />\""It wasn\'t a high priority to have horses brought in before,\"" Johnson says.<br />Horse sales at Northern Farm and the other Yoshida stables now bring in the best trainers, and the richest buyers from across the world.<br />At a two-day auction last year, Katsumi sold 165 horses for a total of ¥6.8 billion ($55.1 million at 2015 prices). A single colt sold for more than $2 million.<br />Britain\'s Racing Post, the industry bible, calls the Yoshidas \""the new superpower of breeding.\""<br />\""If there were plans for a Disney World of bloodstock, it could open almost immediately on the island of Hokkaido in Japan,\"" it wrote in August 2015.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHdgu41o4cp20TUpP_x8lP1_EDSYA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=sk-5V8DbIOvPzAaSqL2AAQ&url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2016/08/20/more-sports/horse-racing/inside-japans-racehorse-breeding-empire/,EN,,21/08/2016 07:11,2016-08-20 12:08:05+00:00,f391c0214d,The Japan Times,,,,,1471702085,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9a023f467e,"Burgers may need higher cooking temperature to be safe from E. coli, University of Alberta researchers say - National Post","Burgers may need higher cooking temperature to be safe from E. coli, University of Alberta researchers say<br />University of Alberta researchers are concerned after finding E. coli bacteria survived recommended temperatures for cooking meat.<br />Lynn McMullen, a food biologist, and other researchers at the U of A\'s Agri-Food Discovery Place, have been performing experiments on E. coli after one of students found the bacteria in cooked beef. McMullen said that should have been impossible.<br />\""We had a huge collection of strains of E. coli that came from meat processing plants, and we decided to screen and see if any were heat resistant,\"" McMullen said.<br />\""So our student came back and said \'This one survives 70 minutes at 60 C,\' and I said, \'Wrong, E. coli doesn\'t do that. Something\'s wrong.\' \""<br />Most E. coli strains heated to 60 C are typically killed in less than a minute, McMullen said. The heat-resistant strains survived at that temperature for more than 70 minutes.<br />The heat-resistant bacteria survived at 71 C, the temperature long recommended by Health Canada to cook beef.<br />Collaborators from Alberta Health Services, who have worked with McMullen, have found that some of the bacteria in those made ill by E. coli have the same heat-resistant genetics as the strains studied at the University of Alberta.<br />\""We know that approximately two per cent of all of the E. coli that are in the databases have the genetics for heat resistance,\"" McMullen said.<br />Salt also makes E. coli bacteria heat resistant, though McMullen and the other researchers don\'t know why.<br />Though McMullen and the other researchers haven\'t discovered what temperature will ultimately kill all E. coli, McMullen recommended using a thermometer and cooking meat at 71 C to 73 C. \""It doesn\'t matter when you\'re grilling any ground meat, you should be using a thermometer.\""<br />E. coli bacteria comes in two forms, as pathogens and non-pathogens.

9a04563b38,Cumbria police warn dog owners against sheep-worrying - NW Evening Mail,"Cumbria police warn dog owners against sheep-worrying<br />DOG owners have been warned to stay in control of their pets as lambing season starts in earnest across Cumbria.<br />Police are urging owners to keep their dogs on a lead when in the vicinity of livestock.<br />This year, there has already been a spate of sheep-worrying incidents by dogs, which have injured and in some cases killed sheep. <br />Pregnant ewes are especially vulnerable, with the cost to farmers being much greater if they are harmed. <br />Superintendent Gary Slater of Cumbria Police said: \""Worrying is a very serious issue and one that the police take seriously.<br />\""It can lead to significant consequences for sheep and therefore farmers, and can be so easily prevented by owner\'s keeping their dogs on a lead.<br />\""The issue of sheep worrying is more pertinent to highlight at this time of year, as lambing season approaches.\""<br />Under the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953, sheep-worrying constitutes attacking and chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering as well as abortion or diminution in produce.<br />The law also states that farmers have the right to shoot any dog that is \""at large\"" i.e. not on a lead when in the presence of sheep, even if no attack has yet occurred.<br />Supt Slater added: \""A dog does not have to physically attack livestock to cause harm; even chasing them can cause distress and easily cause a pregnant sheep to miscarry lambs.<br />\""We have provided posters for farmers to display to remind dog owners of their responsibilities. <br />\""We will be taking a proactive approach and positive action against those that allow the offence to occur.\"" <br />By law, dog owners can be charged with an offence for sheep worrying and if convicted could face a fine of up to £1,000. <br />In some cases the Local Authority may also apply for an order to have the dog euthanised. <br />In 2016, the cost to UK farmers as a result of sheep worrying was an estimated £1.4 million whilst in Cumbria there were 31 reported incidents.<br />Cumbria Police also received 44 complaints of sheep attacks last year, and in half of these cases one or more sheep were killed. <br />Last week the Evening Mail reported that a sheep was seriously mauled by a dog and left fighting for its life in the Haverigg banks area.<br />Attacks on two pregnant ewes on Walney in January also resulted in one of them giving birth to a dead lamb and two weeks later six sheep were killed at a nearby caravan park. <br />Anyone who wants to report an incident of sheep-worrying should call Cumbria Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFB9nJUCc4gZZlOjZQ9FyZ9b7RRBw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779392389169&ei=a0etWMipFIrHWav9s5gH&url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/Cumbria-police-warn-dog-owners-against-sheep-worrying-139222aa-76c2-448e-9516-8251acf1000c-ds,EN,,22/02/2017 08:10,2017-02-21 07:02:11+00:00,95c728a7b8,NW Evening Mail,,,,,1487664131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9a1d43d762,Pigs reduced to cannibalism in shocking conditions caught on camera by Bristol vegan group - Bristol Post,"Pigs reduced to cannibalism in shocking conditions caught on camera by Bristol vegan group<br />Pigs have been reduced to feasting on the rotting carcases of other animals on a farm in Warwickshire in shocking conditions caught on camera by a Bristol-based charity. Maggot-ridden piglets discarded in a skip, skulls found in pens and dead pigs with rotting wounds being eaten by other livestock were just some of the grisly scenes discovered by animal rights group Viva![1] during an undercover investigation at Hogwood Farm, near Stratford-upon-Avon, this month. Founder Juliet Gellatley was reduced to tears during a two-day visit to the site, comparing it to a \""surreal vision of hell\"". The conditions at Hogwood Farm, which houses up to 15,000 pigs, have since been reported to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). <br />A dead pig lying in a pen at the farm<br />(Photo: Viva!)<br />\""Pigs were so tightly crammed into a disgustingly dirty industrial unit that it was hard to walk through them,\"" Juliet said. \""Many were covered in lacerations and all were smeared in filth.

d747ded2d1,Pebble Beach: Who pays to move dead whale? - Monterey County Herald,"Who pays to move dead whale?<br />Pebble Beach >> It is still not known who exactly would be responsible for removing the dead humpback whale that washed up near Bird Rock on Saturday.Justin Viezbicke, stranding network coordinator for National Marine Fisheries, said Tuesday the agency has no funding available for removal of whale carcasses. \""It always comes down to resources and we don\'t have the money for removal,\"" he said.If Pebble Beach residents who live in the area would like to have the whale removed, Viezbicke said, they would have to contact the landowner. That, apparently, would be the Pebble Beach Corporation. A spokesman at Pebble Beach Lodge, however, said the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary would have jurisdiction. <br />Calls to the sanctuary office were not returned.A team from Moss Landing Marine Laboratories took samples from the dead whale to determine the cause of death. Viezbicke said he was not aware of any other necropsy plans by the team.Jim Harvey, director of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, said the whale is a female between a year and 2 years old and is between 36- and 40-feet long.\""We have no idea what caused its death,\"" Harvey said.He said the whale had shark bites on it, indicating it was dead before washing ashore. The investigating team, a professor and a graduate student, were not able to see any distinguishing marks on the whale\'s fluke that would match any identification records. It is resting upside down.<br />Harvey said he has suggested that National Marine Fisheries set aside a pot of money to pay for removing dead whales. Those funds have run out, he said.Removing the whale will be expensive, he said, because the carcass is in a rocky area that would prevent large equipment from reaching it. Attaching a line to the whale and trying to pull it out to sea also would be difficult, he said, given its location.Eventually, the carcass will start to decay and smell, then it will break up.\""These kinds of things have the ability to create their own story,\"" he said.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNF4waofyupjIVHdVWAAEESJVWTKyA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779567239875&ei=e3mBWaj1Go6qWomKtvAO&url=http://www.montereyherald.com/environment-and-nature/20170801/pebble-beach-who-pays-to-move-dead-whale,EN,,02/08/2017 07:04,2017-08-01 23:24:09+00:00,ece86a9f0a,Monterey County Herald,,,,,1501637049,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will publish Chance Agency\'s cyberpunk taxi-driving adventure, Neo Cab, and alien-ocean-exploration game, In Other Waters, from Jump Over the Age.<br />The new label has launched a sale with discounts on all of its games across multiple stores and platforms, including Steam, GOG.com, Humble Store, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch to celebrate the metamorphosis.<br />Above: Orwell is back with a dystopian story.Image Credit: Osmotic Studios<br />Former THQ executive Chris Wright founded Surprise Attack 2011 as an indie games marketing consultancy, and it is celebrating its fifth anniversary as a publishing label this month. It is best known for Hacknet, Orwell, and Screencheat.<br />Wright started the Melbourne, Australia-based company after the closure of developers Blue Tongue and THQ Studio Australia.<br />Wright said in an email that the label has always had a taste for the surprising, but it published a diverse and eclectic range of projects, such as party first-person shooter Screencheat, steampunk mini-golf adventure Vertiginous Golf, quick-time quick-draw dueling game Western Press, and the award-winning surveillance thriller series, Orwell.<br />As Fellow Traveller, the company will now focus entirely on working with developers that are pushing the boundaries of what games can be and exploring new ways for the medium to approach narrative. Upcoming titles include the lonely goat-farming game The Stillness of the Wind; VR echolocation thriller Blind; and Genesis Noir, a noir adventure set before, during, and after the Big Bang.<br />\""The indie scene has matured and evolved since I started Surprise Attack in 2011. Back then, the idea of an indie publisher was seen as an oxymoron, but today, there is a large and mature group of indie labels with more launching all the time,\"" said Wright, managing director of Fellow Traveller. \""Just like the indie record labels that inspired us to start the company, we want to build a reputation for a particular flavor of game. We believe this is the next step for indie labels to help developers stand out in an increasingly crowded market and help gamers find the kind of game they love. We\'re all about the weird and the wonderful and pushing the boundaries of how games tell stories. We hope to attract both the developers and gamers who are into our kind of game to join us on this journey.\""<br />Fellow Traveller\'s upcoming slate of games and its expected publication dates include: The Stillness of the Wind from Lambic Studios, Q3 2018; Blind from Tiny Bull Studios, Q3 2018; an unannounced game, Q3 2018; Neo Cab from Chance Agency, Q1 2019; The Invisible Hand from Power Struggle Games, Q1 2019; an unannounced game, Q1 2019; an unannounced game, Q2 2019; In Other Waters from Jump Over the Age, Q1 2020; and Genesis Noir from Feral Cat Den, Q1 2020.<br />Fellow Traveller has seven full-time and part-time employees. Aside from a small, five-figure round, the company is self-funded.<br />In an email, Wright said, \""We expect to still have a fairly wide mix of genres, art styles, gameplay types on the label. Often, the games we\'re signing have a unique gameplay interaction that doesn\'t 100 percent fit into a standard genre - Orwell for example. The sort of game that definitely falls outside of our new focus would be things like arcade games, multiplayer party games, anything that is driven more by mechanics or action or where narrative is not important.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFablGhTtRRBzdBA_V-sFaMKTrFMA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779974620402&ei=8fNWW5j3Kc-2zAbHl6WQBQ&url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/23/orwell-indie-publishing-label-surprise-attack-games-rebrands-as-fellow-traveler/,EN,,24/07/2018 09:37,2018-07-24 00:00:57+00:00,7e768e403e,VentureBeat,,,,,1532397657,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e61a075119,Cows dying slow deaths from obstructed bowels in UP - India Today,"UP: Eating polybags and non-biodegradable waste, cows suffer from obstructive bowel syndrome : India, News<br />At a time when the Yogi Adityanath government in UP is likening the opposition of their version of \'Hindutva\' with sedition, the cows, which are the most revered animals in Hinduism, are dying a slow and painful death in the state from eating polybags and other non-biodegradable waste.The Yogi government is coming down hard on cow[1] smugglers in the state and all district magistrates in UP have been given special instructions to make suitable arrangements for the housing of stray cows in \'Gaushalas\'. But even in these gaushalas, no attention is being paid to what the cows are eating.Consequently, all over UP, cows are suffering from obstructive bowel syndrome from eating polybags, fed to them by the same cow-worshipping crowd that claims that the cow is the mother of man. Yesterday, in a major surgery of a cow\'s abdomen, doctors retrieved 60 kilograms of polythene and other waste in the veterinary hospital at Kosi Kotwan near Mathura. The cow had been brought to the hospital from a Gaushala operated by a charitable trust.Devi Chitralekha, the principal volunteer and trustee at the Gaushala told India Today that the cows have not been eating anything for the past several days, so it was brought to the hospital where an x-ray of its abdomen revealed a lot of waste choking the cow\'s digestive tract.When the cow was taken for surgery, it was revealed that its entire digestive tract was stuffed with polythene and other waste, which included metal foils used in wrapping food. The total weight of this waste extracted from the cow\'s abdomen was about 60 kg. Following the surgery, the cow is recovering and is also eating now.Senior citizen and social activist Uma Shanker Sharma said that although the cow is called \'mother\', but the fact is that most of the people who raise these cows, leave them to graze in the garbage heaps instead of giving them proper food every day. Most of the cows that eat from garbage heaps scattered all over the city are suffering from various ailments connected to the consumption of organic and inorganic waste materials and die sooner than their usual age.He said that polythene has been banned all over UP, but no efforts are made to control the sale and purchase of polythene in the state, so in the end, all this polythene ends up in the garbage heaps and then in the cow\'s belly, making them sick. If the UP Chief Minister really thinks about the welfare of cows, he should put a strict ban on polythene all over the state, he said. Also, he demanded that those who leave their cows to roam around on the roads instead of keeping them in a healthy and safe environment inside their premises, should be prosecuted and the cows sent to cow-shelters where they are subjected to regular medical tests and treatment as needed.References^ cow (indiatoday.intoday.in)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHIreAKC2-AbLc1xULTSuAyod7dVg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=90UNWsCIEsr6zAbs7KmIBA&url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cow-deaths-up-yogi/1/1090140.html,EN,,16/11/2017 08:01,2017-11-15 11:11:45+00:00,c9593f6e51,India Today,,,,,1510747905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e641ee98d9,The Anti-Abortion Movement Has Made a Deal with the Devil (Trump ... - Broadly,"The Anti-Abortion Movement Has Made a Deal with the Devil (Trump)<br />As Washington D.C. filled with tens of thousands of abortion opponents last week, there was a jubilant feeling in the air. Though the annual March for Life was ostensibly a massive protest against the continued existence of legal abortion in America, movement leaders were also celebrating a year of victories, most of them due to President Donald Trump. It was impossible to miss the number of patriotic ski caps and and scarves-usually a rare sight at anti-abortion protests-as well as the occasional iconic red ball cap, and even a \""Make Unborn Babies Great Again\"" sign meant as an homage to the new commander in chief. It is undeniable that the anti-abortion movement has reached a new peak in political power. There are anti-abortion majorities in the House and Senate. And although almost every single anti-abortion rights political organization in the nation opposed Trump during the Republican primary, he has carried out their will with surprising efficacy in office. Not only has he kept his promise to oppose legal abortion if elected, he\'s also eagerly embraced his new \""pro-life\"" stance with the sort of fervor only a newly minted convert can project. In just his first full year in office, Trump has stacked his administration[1] with key opponents to abortion rights and birth control, reversed a number of Obama-era orders on state funding of reproductive health clinics, cut funding[2] to foreign family planning groups that even mention abortion, extended legal protections[3] to medical staff that refuse to provide abortions or other sexual health services for religious reasons, and stacked the judiciary-including by appointing a far-right Supreme Court nominee[4]-so thoroughly that the ramifications will be felt for decades. It\'s a positive-and very unexpected-turn of events for anti-abortion activists, who initially approached Trump\'s candidacy as simply saving themselves from a Clinton presidency. Little could they expect that the same man who once praised Planned Parenthood[5] for helping low income and uninsured women access healthcare, who claimed to grab women \""by the pussy,\"" and whose treatment of women has been so well-known and shockingly degrading that the public no longer bats an eye to hear he was allegedly spanked with copy of Forbes magazine[6] during an affair that took place shortly after his wife gave birth, to suddenly materialize as the pro-life movement\'s savior. Some unusually patriotic anti-abortion protesters at the March for Life. All photos by Robin Marty \""Because of President Trump, we have had more pro-life legislation come out than any president since Reagan. He\'s done even more than Reagan!\"" announced Brian Gibson of Pro-Life Action Ministries, an action group located in Minnesota and Florida. Gibson was addressing a crowd of roughly 150 people protesting the D.C. Planned Parenthood the morning before the actual march, an annual tradition arranged by Priests for Life. It was a theme that was repeated throughout the D.C. events, from the protest to affiliated conferences. Introducing Trump, who addressed the march via live satellite feed, Vice President Mike Pence called him \""the most pro-life president in American history... a tireless defender of life and conscience in America.\"" Some anti-abortion leaders went as far as to suggest that he was the greatest gift the movement could have hoped for. \""I was told during the campaign by some advisors of his that he would do what past pro-life presidents had done and more,\"" said Father Frank Pavone of Priests for Life. \""He tries to push things further than before. Not just reinstating the Mexico City Policy [which punishes foreign NGOs for discussing abortion] but expanding it. Not just addressing the March for Life but doing a whole event. You see these steps that he\'s trying to take to do extra. He\'ll do some things in the future that will be creative and even surprising.\""One prominent activist, who asked not to be named, said that none of the other Republican candidates in 2016 would have gone as far as Trump: While they may very well have made the same executive decisions, Trump has appointed prominent anti-abortion leaders and consultants to key staff positions, creating a veritable pro-life All Star bench-one that no other conservative likely would have replicated. (Particularly important, the activist said, was the choice of the virulently anti-abortion[7] Pence as VP.) This very well may be true. The addition of anti-abortion activists in key positions all throughout the administration has created a body in which it has become increasingly difficult to see any difference between the White House and the movement itself. That became increasingly obvious during the events surrounding the March, where, for the first time in history, three of the highest ranking officials in the country-the President, Vice President and Speaker of the House-all addressed the Marchers live, and, in Speaker Paul Ryan\'s case, in person. In the day leading into the March, Students for Life president Kristan Hawkins and some of her chapter leaders visited the White House and had an exclusive roundtable meeting with Pence and his wife Karen, and afterward numerous movement leaders[8] attended a \""Pro-Life VIP\"" reception at the old executive office building. The rapport between the administration and the anti-abortion movement is the coziest it\'s ever been, and only seems to be growing cozier. But while many anti-abortion activists applauded the President and relished in the power that being so close to the administration offered, not every activist was so unconditionally excited by their new bedfellow. Rev. Pat Mahoney, a former leader of the extreme anti-abortion group Operation Rescue and now director of the Christian Defense Coalition, finds himself divided over the movement\'s growing ties with President Trump. Despite being close to the administration-Mahoney had actually been invited to attend while the President spoke in the Rose Garden-he remains uncomfortable with Trump\'s rhetoric beyond \""life issues\"" such as abortion or religious freedom. \""I\'m glad any president will speak on ending the violence of abortion and standing for human rights injustice,\"" he told Broadly. \""But I\'ve been very vocal speaking out about his comments on \'s-hole\' or \'s-house.\'\"" The language itself was far less offensive, he continued, than the fact that the President appeared to imply Americans prefer immigrants \""from countries that are predominately white than we do from countries that are brown or black, which is deplorable.\"" \""I\'ve said for years that perhaps the greatest problem with the pro-life movement is that we connect so closely to the Republican Party,\"" Mahoney added. Destiny Herndon-de la Rosa, president of New Wave Feminists, a younger, often irreverent feminist anti-abortion group, was more blunt: \""We stop looking like we support women when we support a guy who grabs pussies.\"" According to Herndon-de la Rosa, the pro-life movement\'s leaders made a big mistake deciding to tie themselves so tightly to the administration and the GOP in general. Promising to end abortion is the quickest, easiest way to engage a massive voter base, she explained, sounding slightly conspiratorial, and if abortion were finally made illegal, that tool would be lost. \""Sure, they got [Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch appointed]-they got their 30 pieces of silver for getting Trump elected, he comes to speak at your pro-life march, but one of their big things was defunding Planned Parenthood, and he hasn\'t done that,\"" she said. \""I don\'t think they are in a big rush to overturn Roe or any of these other things they claim to be doing. I don\'t see that happening. So yeah, they have all the power, but they aren\'t going to do jack shit about it.\"" Is the GOP using the pro-life movement? Is the movement using the GOP? Either way, both of them have one thing in common: They threw their lot in with the flawed and now highly unpopular President Trump, and their opponents aren\'t going to let disentangle themselves from that association. \""The anti-choice movement says time and time again that they are so proud to have Donald Trump-the same man who called women bimbos, pigs, dogs, slobs, said that he could grab us by the you-know-what-by their side. They own this president,\"" said Kaylee Hanson Long, the national communications director for NARAL Pro-choice America. \""They own his policies, they own his rhetoric, and they made that decision back in 2016 when they stood right by him unapologetically even though they knew what kind of person he was. They are certainly tied together; they are one and the same.\"" Now just a court case away from potentially overturning Roe v. Wade or, even more alarmingly, just one or two states from having enough Republican-controlled legislatures to pass a constitutional amendment banning abortion, the anti-abortion movement has massive political clout and the ability - if they wanted to - to push for the most extreme anti-abortion laws in history. But they got there by embracing the most divisive, problematic president in the country\'s history, and they could pay the price of that alliance when the midterms come, as the political landscape very well may shift again. Maybe that\'s the true legacy of getting into bed with Donald Trump: You never know what will happen once you\'re between the sheets.References^ stacked his administration (broadly.vice.com)^ cut funding (broadly.vice.com)^ extended legal protections (broadly.vice.com)^ far-right Supreme Court nominee (broadly.vice.com)^ who once praised Planned Parenthood (www.cnn.com)^ allegedly spanked with copy of Forbes magazine (www.vice.com)^ virulently anti-abortion (www.vox.com)^ numerous movement leaders (www1.cbn.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFVuYQxkDIfoRCtbb1amYsSiQ1WSQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779784299990&ei=uslyWrjjOsi-W9PNsfAN&url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/yw5y75/the-anti-abortion-movement-has-made-a-deal-with-the-devil-trump,EN,,01/02/2018 08:01,2018-01-30 17:47:03+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,Broadly,,,,,1517338023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e64ac98154,Doctor of an equine kind: Arrowhead Veterinary Clinic cares for large animals in southern Utah County and beyond - Daily Herald,"Doctor of an equine kind: Arrowhead Veterinary Clinic cares for large animals in southern Utah County and beyond | Payson News<br />\'He\'s good,\"" shouts Dr. Mike Walburger.The bull he had just vaccinated and tagged is released from the squeeze chute and charges out into the corral, a farm dog chasing it towards the other bulls. Walburger readies himself for the next bull as it\'s coaxed into the squeeze chute. He along with his assistant and two of the owners of the farm in Levan are there to help Walburger process approximately 30 bulls during the house call.After about an hour and a close call with a wild bull, Walburger finishes up his work and heads back to his clinic in Payson. It\'s just after noon, and he has been working since before the sun came up, and will work for several more hours.<br />\""We don\'t have a 9 to 5, we have a \'from eyes open to eyes closed kind of a job,\'\"" said Walburger with a laugh.Walburger, a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, is the chief physician at the Arrowhead Veterinary Clinic, located at 4279 W. 12800 South just south of Payson. The clinic specializes in caring for large farm animals, primarily cows and horses, though it also occasionally services smaller animals.Walburger and his assistants are able to care for animals at the clinic, or at the homes of their owners. The clinic serves large-animal owners in Utah County primarily from Provo southward, but house calls can take Walburger and his crew further away to neighboring Juab and Sanpete counties if the proper facilities are available.Working with numerous farmers and ranchers in the rural areas of southern Utah County, Walburger and his staff have a close relationship with the farming community, especially the beef industry.\""I get a lot of satisfaction in knowing that these guys, I mean ultimately, these animals end up in our food source,\"" explained Walburger. \""Growing up I had a hand in that, we raised beef, and these guys do the same. I guess I take a little pride in that I\'m helping to provide a safe, wholesome food source for the American consumer, in kind of a stretch.\""While growing up on a farm around Mountain View in Alberta, Canada, it became readily apparent to Walburger that he wanted make working with animals his life\'s work.\""I was a farm kid then, and that\'s just what I wanted to do: I wanted to do large animals,\"" recalled Walburger. \""Dogs and cats are great, I enjoy doing those as well, but I have a passion for large animals and the farmers.\""Upon graduating high school, Walburger attended Montana State University for his undergraduate degree and then continued on to Kansas State University to earn his veterinarian degree. After graduation, he practiced in Idaho for a year and then moved to Spanish Fork to a three-doctor clinic where he practiced for the next 17 years. Just recently, the practice splintered apart, and Walburger started his own practice: the Arrowhead Veterinary Clinic.However, the current location of the clinic is temporary.\""Right now, we\'re in the process of getting a new place built,\"" Walburger said. \""The late Lewis Feild and his family has allowed us to be there. It\'s just been awesome to work with that family and to be in that spot.\""The location features stalls to house horses, squeeze chutes and working facilities to hold and process cows, which allows the clinic to be able to handle the majority of issues that arise with large animals.\""There\'s not very many of those in the county at all, so when the opportunity came to move there, well that was a great thing,\"" said Walburger.Despite looking for a more permanent location, the clinic will look to stay in the Payson area. \""We\'ll stay right close here,\"" said Walburger. \""The majority of our clientele is still there.\""For Walburger and his crew, there\'s never a typical day at the office.\""There\'s an unpredictability about it,\"" explained Walburger. \""It\'s not really the same thing every day, and that in of itself is refreshing, it allows you to not get too droned out.\""The clinic handles a plethora of large-animal issues such as colic and belly aches, physical injuries and lameness, regulatory procedures including vaccinations and tagging, birthing animals, and putting them down later in life if they cannot withstand their aliments.The work they do depends on the season, and springtime is the busiest season. \""We make all of our money between February and May,\"" said Walburger.Spring generally consists of lots of cow-related calls and regulatory procedures such as vaccinations and checking if bulls are fit to breed for another year.Walburger and his assistants are constantly running from case to case, animal to animal. Through it all, Walburger does his best to keep things positive.<br />\""We try not to get too wound up, and sometimes it\'s hard,\"" he said. \""We\'ve just got to have a good time.\""Whether it be singing \""Goodnight Sally\"" to a horse as he sedates it to work on its teeth, or breaking into \""We\'re off to see the wizard...\"" as he hops into his pickup to head south to vaccinate bulls, Walburger does his best to keep the often hectic atmosphere of his job light.While he hustles from case to case, he has several helping hands to keep him on track.\""It\'s really just a tribute to the staff and keeping everything organized,\"" Walburger said. \""You see them bustling around and making sure that we go do the work, but then they keep working to organize the paperwork and keep everything done. The help that I have is just amazing.\""\""If I\'m not working, I\'m playing with my own horses,\"" said Emmy Richardson, one of Walburger\'s assistants. \""I\'m always around some sort of animal, but I spend most of my time at the clinic.\""Richardson has been working full-time at the clinic for the past three years and hopes to one day have her own cow farm. \""I just learn what I can here and try to remember it,\"" she said.Though recently cows have been the most frequently cared-for animals at the clinic, horses account for the majority of the clinic\'s services.\""Just being a part of the horse industry and athletic-type animals is just fun,\"" said Walburger. \""Being involved with the kids in the 4-H, and the FFA, giving little seminars, and being able to see my clients take our patient, their horse, and go win a competition - to have that be something we\'re a part of and they allowed us to be a part of that, that\'s pretty cool.\""Utah is a hotbed for equestrian talent, and working with horses allows the clinic to be a part of the equine industry. \""We\'ve been able to do work for the premier rodeo athletes that travel up and down I-15,\"" he said.For a man who\'s been around farms his whole life, Walburger summed up his job by saying, \""It\'s an extension of the lifestyle really. It\'s just right.\""\""There\'s an unpredictability about it. It\'s not really the same thing every day, and that in of itself is refreshing, it allows you to not get too droned out.\"" - Dr. Mike Walburger, Arrowhead Veterinary Clinic",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNE30MglEZD3bCtm5CS9C7jLHWKOWQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=jETjWLDRM4XHWf7cs7gJ&url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/south/payson/doctor-of-an-equine-kind-arrowhead-veterinary-clinic-cares-for/article_d3837501-a2df-509c-9586-65423a12abe3.html,EN,,04/04/2017 07:00,2017-04-03 12:05:49+00:00,09f6823154,Daily Herald,,,,,1491228349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12bf7cd095,QE2 program helps patients breathe easier - TheChronicleHerald.ca,"QE2 program helps patients breathe easier<br />Tony White says when his respiratory illness makes him hungry for air, fear can seize what\'s left of his breath.<br />\""If you can\'t breathe, you become very tense and anxious about things. It\'s almost like a person drowning really,\"" says White, 74, a Halifax resident who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as COPD.<br />White says a home-based pilot program provided by the Queen Elizabeth II hospital is reducing the cycle of anxiety and the problems he has with being breathless that his illness creates.<br />\""It gives a lot of hope,\"" he says.<br />The program - dubbed inspired by the Capital District Health Authority - ranges from teaching participants to administer their own medicine to talking over concerns with a chaplain as the incurable disease progresses.<br />The illness is most often caused by smoking and progressively takes away the ability to comfortably inhale as tiny air sacs in the lungs deteriorate. A 2009-10 study by the Public Health Agency of Canada estimates about 770,000 Canadians have been diagnosed with the illness.<br />In later stages, many patients need an oxygen supply, infections increase and the inability to exhale stale air leads to increasing discomfort and distress.<br />The Halifax program is using home visits, regular telephone contact and written plans to help about 70 patients who have moderate to severe versions of the illness, or who had prior hospital visits over the past year due to the illness.<br />Respiratory therapists have examined White\'s rate of oxygen exchange. They have shown him shoulder relaxation methods and ways to move his body that use less energy. He\'s been given instruction on ways to improve the use of medicine that he inhales.<br />It\'s also given him an advance prescription for antibiotics that allowed him to treat an infection that might have quickly spiralled out of control.<br />\""An appointment with the doctor (for the prescription) might have taken two days and two days could be crucial,\"" says White\'s wife and caregiver, Cathy.<br />The team care White receives includes chats with Rev. Cathy Simpson, a chaplain who was recently visiting to help White complete a written plan for his treatment and care when he nears the end of his life.<br />\""I want to die in peace,\"" White says, adding that completing the personal directive is one more way to keep mastery of your own life while you still can.<br />Dr. Graeme Rocker, head respirologist at the Capital District Health Authority, says the community-based treatment approach improves care while saving money for Nova Scotia\'s health system.<br />After their first year of the project, which he launched last winter, the first 27 patients have seen a significant drop in visits to emergency and time spent in hospital, compared to the year before.<br />\""For the most part, the patients who have been through our . . . program are not coming back to emergency. We\'ve cut their admission rate by approximately 70 per cent,\"" says Rocker.<br />He estimates the $200,000 per year cost of the pilot program has already saved about $500,000 in acute care costs as hospital stays are eliminated.<br />Joanne Young, a respiratory therapist with the program, says she observed during a decade at a home health care service in New Brunswick that simple techniques can sometimes change a housebound patient\'s life.<br />Shortage of breath - known as dyspnoea - can be worsened by anxiety, and the more tense the patient becomes the more it disrupts the breathing function, she says.<br />\""It\'s a hugely mental thing . . . there\'s a large part of it that is in your head. . . . All of the anxiety and tension actually disturbs your lung mechanics.\""<br />Meanwhile, Rev. Simpson spends long hours in conversations with patients, and the banter leads to insights to help improve their health and their level of hope.<br />\""I don\'t particularly like sitting around,\"" says White, a former Royal Air Force pilot, during one of the chats.<br />Soon, the conversation shifts to a discussion of White\'s desire to be able to climb a few steps to a relative\'s home, rather than waiting in the car while his wife goes inside.<br />Simpson relays that information to Dr. Rocker, who can explore changes to therapy that might make the extra step a possibility.<br />Dr. Darcy Marciniuk, head of the respirology division at the Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon, says the Halifax efforts to bring more treatment to the community reflect a wider trend in treatment of chronic illnesses.<br />The Saskatoon hospital operates a program called LiveWell for the management of respiratory and some other chronic illnesses.<br />One element of the program is organizing gatherings outside the hospital for patients to share advice about their chronic illnesses. There are also exercise classes tailored to respiratory diseases at a nearby field house and in satellite sites.<br />The program\'s nurses regularly follow up with patients who are discharged from the hospital, and Marciniuk stays in touch with family physicians of patients he\'s tracking.<br />Like Rocker, he\'s reporting major drops in hospital readmissions.<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEYhAIyMAzhb3SIOWyqUVcpguRAAw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=17594019323275&ei=hIu8VqDsENrya6_SssAJ&url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/80849-qe2-program-helps-patients-breathe-easier,EN,,11/02/2016 13:25,2012-04-04 08:27:42+00:00,89284ea485,TheChronicleHerald.ca,,,,,1333535262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e665447c22,SQU gets patent for invention to treat snakebite cases - Muscat Daily,"SQU gets patent for invention to treat snakebite cases - Oman<br />The patent application was filed last year with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) according to a statement by the university.<br />The invention is an ethanolic extract of fruits from the Ajwa date palm to treat local haemorrhage and oedema caused by snakebites.<br />Commenting on the invention, Prof Jabri said that it is the result of more than ten years of research work. \""It relates to a novel treatment for snake envenomation. It is an effective treatment using ethanolic extract of the fruit from the Ajwa date (Phoenix dactylifera L)<br /> palm to treat local haemorrhage and oedema induced by snake bites.\""<br />The importance of this invention is related to the fact that there are more than 5.5mn snakebites annually across the globe, which usually results in almost 2mn envenoming resulting in more than 95,000 deaths.<br />Envenoming by snakes such as Echis ocellatus<br /> and Naja naja nigricollis<br /> is responsible for several clinical complications of severe systemic and local pathology.<br />For example, E. ocellatus<br /> leads to inflammation (such as swelling, blistering and necrosis) and haemorrhages due to both metalloproteases and ecarin (an enzyme that activates prothrombin). Also, envenoming by Naja naja nigricollis<br /> induced clinical complications different from that caused by E. ocellatus<br />. These include local necrosis, haemorrhage, complement depletion, and respiratory arrest or paralysis.<br />Prof Jabri said that although several efforts have been made for effective remedial and preventive methods, there is currently no adequate treatment for local haemorrhage, oedema and necrosis caused by snake envenomation.<br />Intravenous administration of anti-venom, prepared from antibodies (IgG) of venom-immunised horses or sheep, is an effective treatment for systemic envenoming. However, anti-venom is of limited effectiveness against the effects of local haemorrhage and oedema that develop rapidly after a snakebite.<br />Research to develop treatment for local haemorrhage, oedema and dermonecrosis is therefore of clinical priority and has focused on the application of natural or synthetic inhibitors of snake venom potent molecules.<br />\""The rational of the current invention was, therefore, to search for an agent that fulfil the drawbacks associated with the current anti-venom. Luckily after a long period of investigations, the inventors came up with an adequate and a novel method that results in the treatment of local hemorrhage caused by snake venoms. This not only prevents death but also other clinical complications associated with snake envenomation.

eedc59ded9,Ferocious Fires Spark Concern Over Major Health Consequences - KSTP,"Ferocious Fires Spark Concern Over Major Health Consequences<br />Short-term exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen existing asthma and lung disease, leading to emergency room treatment or hospitalization, studies have shown.<br />Increases in doctor visits or hospital treatment for respiratory infections, bronchitis and pneumonia in otherwise healthy people also have been found during and after wildfires.<br />Some studies also have found increases in ER visits for heart attacks and strokes in people with existing heart disease on heavy smoke days during previous California wildfires, echoing research on potential risks from urban air pollution.<br />For most healthy people, exposure to wildfire smoke is just an annoyance, causing burning eyes, scratchy throats or chest discomfort that all disappear when the smoke clears.<br />But doctors, scientists and public health officials are concerned that the changing face of wildfires will pose a much broader health hazard,<br />\""Wildfire season used to be June to late September. Now it seems to be happening all year round. We need to be adapting to that,\"" Dr. Wayne Cascio, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cardiologist, said this week.<br />In an overview published earlier this year, Cascio wrote that the increasing frequency of large wildland fires, urban expansion into wooded areas and an aging population are all increasing the number of people at risk for health problems from fires.<br />More from KSTP:<br />Fire Death Toll at 56 and Counting in Northern California<br />Dogs and Portable Morgues: Search Intensifies in California Wildfire Zone <br />Northern California Fire Officials Begin Agonizing Search for Dead<br />Wood smoke contains some of the same toxic chemicals as urban air pollution, along with tiny particles of vapor and soot 30 times thinner than a human hair. These can infiltrate the bloodstream, potentially causing inflammation and blood vessel damage even in healthy people, research on urban air pollution has shown. Studies have linked heart attacks and cancer with long-term exposure to air pollution.<br />Whether exposure to wildfire smoke carries the same risks is uncertain, and determining harm from smog versus wildfire smoke can be tricky, especially with wind-swept California wildfires spreading thick smoke hundreds of miles away into smoggy big cities.<br />\""That is the big question,\"" said Dr. John Balmes, a University of California, San Francisco, professor of medicine who studies air pollution.<br />\""Very little is known about the long-term effects of wildfire smoke because it\'s hard to study populations years after a wildfire,\"" Balmes said.<br />Decreased lung function has been found in healthy firefighters during fire season. They tend to recover but federal legislation signed this year will establish a U.S. registry tracking firefighters and potential risks for various cancers, including lung cancer. Some previous studies suggested a risk.<br />Firefighters battle a fire along the Ronald Reagan (118) Freeway in Simi Valley, Calif., Monday, Nov. 12, 2018. <br />AP/Ringo H.W. Chiu<br />Balmes noted that increased lung cancer rates have been found in women in developing countries who spend every day cooking over wood fires.<br />That kind of extreme exposure doesn\'t typically happen with wildfires, but experts worry about the kinds of health damage that may emerge for firefighters and residents with these blazes occurring so often.<br />Whether that includes more cancer is unknown. \""We\'re concerned about that,\"" Balmes said.<br />Regular folks breathing in all that smoke worry about the risks too.<br />Smoke from the fire that decimated the Northern California city of Paradise darkened skies this week in San Francisco, nearly 200 miles southwest, and the air smelled \""like you were camping,\"" said Michael Northover, a contractor.<br />He and his 14-year-old son have first-time sinus infections that Northover blames on the smoke.<br />\""We\'re all kind of feeling it,\"" Northover said.<br />Classes were canceled Thursday in at least six universities in Northern California as smoke from the fire continued to blanket all nine counties of the Bay Area. Some were closing all buildings but others, including Cal State East Bay said libraries, health centers and dining halls would stay open.<br />At Chico State University, 11 miles from Paradise, ash was falling this week and classes were canceled until after Thanksgiving.<br />\""It\'s kind of freaky to see your whole town wearing air masks and trying to get out of smoke,\"" said freshman Mason West, 18. \""You can see the particles. Obviously it\'s probably not good to be breathing that stuff in.\""<br />West returned home this week to Santa Rosa, hard hit by last year\'s wine country fire, only to find it shrouded in smoke from the Paradise fire 100 miles away. West\'s family had to evacuate last year for a week but their home was spared.<br />\""It\'s as bad here as it was in Chico,\"" West said. \""It almost feels like you just can\'t get away from it.\""<br />Smoke has been so thick in Santa Rosa that researchers postponed a door-to-door survey there for a study of health effects of last year\'s fire.<br />\""We didn\'t feel we could justify our volunteer interns going knocking on doors when all the air quality alerts were saying stay indoors,\"" said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a public health researcher at the University of California, Davis. The study includes an online survey of households affected by last year\'s fire, with responses from about 6,000 people so far.<br />Preliminary data show widespread respiratory problems, eye irritations, anxiety, depression and sleep problems around the time of the fire and months later.<br />\""Conventional thinking is that these effects related to fires are transient. It\'s not entirely clear that\'s the case,\"" Hertz-Picciotto said.<br />Researchers also will be analyzing cord blood and placentas collected from a few dozen women who were pregnant during the fire, seeking evidence of stress markers or exposure to smoke chemicals.<br />They hope to continue the study for years, seeking evidence of long-term physical and emotional harms to fire evacuees and their children.<br />Other studies have linked emotional stress in pregnant women to developmental problems in their children and \""this was quite a stress,\"" Hertz-Picciotto said.<br />It\'s a kind of stress that many people need to prepare for as the climate warms and wildfires proliferate, she said.<br />\""Any of us could wake up tomorrow and lose everything we own,\"" she said. \""It\'s pretty scary.\"" <br />Join the conversation on our social media platforms.<br />Share your comments on our Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages.<br />Credits<br />Associated Press <br />Updated: November 15, 2018 01:53 PMCreated: November 15, 2018 01:35 PM<br />Copyright 2018 - KSTP-TV, LLC A Hubbard Broadcasting Company",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHuVCEtV7OVCZ8YGnAVYn7tohzSFA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52780103527355&ei=PX3uW6jyG8zmzQaC7oOQAQ&url=https://kstp.com/medical/ferocious-fires-spark-concern-over-major-health-consequences-/5146291/?cat%3D12678,EN,,16/11/2018 08:16,2018-11-15 18:55:50+00:00,ae68d3d05a,KSTP,,,,,1542311750,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eedd7f8100,Researchers identify chemical compound that inhibits Ebola virus - Medical Xpress,"Researchers identify chemical compound that inhibits Ebola virus<br />Ebola virus. Credit: NIAID<br />An organic chemical compound shows effective antiviral activity against Ebola virus and several other viruses, according to a study led by Georgia State University.<br />The researchers found benzoquinoline inhibited the ability of Ebola virus[1] to multiply and reproduce in cell culture. The findings are published in the journal Antiviral Research.<br />Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that causes severe disease in humans. The largest outbreak on record for the filovirus family was caused by Ebola virus in West Africa between 2013 and 2016, resulting in more than 28,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths.<br />Only experimental treatments were available, and survivors, including health care workers, are at risk for persistent infections from the virus remaining in sites that can tolerate foreign substances without eliciting an inflammatory immune response, such as the eye and testes. There are no approved drugs to treat Ebola virus or other filovirus infections, so there is a critical need for new therapeutic approaches. A potential antiviral target is the viral machinery and activities involved in carrying out RNA synthesis for Ebola virus.<br />\""This work provides a foundation for the development of novel antiviral agents to combat Ebola virus,\"" said Dr. Christopher Basler, director of the Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State and a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Microbial Pathogenesis.<br />In this study, the researchers screened a library of 200,000 small molecule compounds to identify potential inhibitors of Ebola virus RNA synthesis. They identified 56 hits that inhibited Ebola virus activity by more than 70 percent, while showing less than a 20 percent chance of being toxic to cells. They discovered three chemical structures with potent antiviral activity against Ebola virus in cell culture.<br />Human lung epithelial cells and human embryonic kidney cells were exposed to several viruses, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and Zika virus, and the antiviral effects of the three chemical structures were observed.<br />One of these chemical structures[2], benzoquinoline, showed antiviral activity[3] against Ebola virus and was also active against another deadly filovirus, Marburg virus. Benzoquinoline was also effective against vesicular stomatitis virus[4] from the rhabdovirus family, which can infect insects, cattle, horses and pigs, and Zika virus, which is spread to humans by mosquitoes.<br />\""This study is part of a larger effort to find new therapies to treat highly dangerous Ebola virus infections,\"" said lead author Dr. Priya Luthra of Georgia State.<br />Explore further: <br />Ebola virus exploits host enzyme for efficient entry to target cells[5]<br />More information:<br />Priya Luthra et al.

f2836d39ef,"Palm, soybean oil markets moved higher last week - Born2Invest","Palm, soybean oil markets moved higher last week<br />The markets of palm oil, soybean oil and canola had a good week as these three experienced increases. The palm oil market received some boost with the help of strong outcomes concerning its export earlier this month.<br />Wheat<br />US markets were lower last week in all three markets. The trade remains concerned about demand even though the weekly export sales report was strong last week. Export demand appears to be in line with USDA projections for the year. Traders do not appear all that concerned with the slower than normal planting progress for crops in the Great Plains and Midwest as there is plenty of Wheat available around the world. The US looks to plant fewer acres to wheat again this year, meaning that the US will have less area planted to wheat than seen over the last 100 or more years once again this year. The weekly charts show that futures moved close to some support areas again last week.<br />Australia has started to see some rains that have started to break the extreme drought seen in wheat country. However, it is close to harvest time now, so the rains might not be all that beneficial as big rains now could damage the quality of what will be a very small crop. Even so, Australian prices have moved lower and Australian Wheat is providing more competition for sales in the Far East for the US now.<br />US wheat remains very competitive in world markets due to reduced production from about all origins except for Russia. Russia has been selling aggressively and has set the world price, but US prices are just as cheap right now. This is due to the weaker futures along with the weaker US dollar. Wheat prices are cheap enough now and need not go lower. A big rally will probably be difficult without better and sustained demand.<br />Weekly Chicago Soft Red Winter Wheat Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Chicago Hard Red Winter Wheat Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Minneapolis Hard Red Spring Wheat Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Corn<br />Corn closed lower and oats closed a little higher for the week as the US corn harvest expands in much of the Midwest. The export sales report on Thursday was very strong for corn and was a reason to buy the market, but traders seem much more interested in the harvest and the potential for increasing supplies. Basis levels remain very weak but are starting to improve again as transportation logistics become easier. The Mississippi and Illinois rivers have been low due to lack of rainfall and barge transportation has been difficult and very expensive.<br />There has been some significant rain in the Midwest over the last couple of weeks, with more seen over the weekend, and river levels should be improving. A lock on the Ohio River was closed for emergency repairs and that caused transportation problems on that river system, but has now been repaired. Basis levels throughout the Midwest have reacted to the improved situation, although they remain generally weak as it is still harvesting time.<br />The market is hearing more harvest results as activity moves north into central parts of the Corn Belt and also gets active in the east. Yields have been generally strong, but the harvest pace has been a little slow as producers have been concentrating more on getting the soybeans harvested and letting the corn dry in the fields. Many producers in central and eastern areas are now about done with the soybeans harvest and will now concentrate on corn.<br />Weekly Corn Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Oats Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Soybeans and Soybean Meal<br />Soybeans and soybean meal were lower on Friday in reaction to ideas of strong harvest progress and big crops being harvested. Soybean Meal also suffers from weak demand due to strong competition from DDGS in the market and on ideas that crush levels can remain strong due to the need to produce soybean oil on reduced Argentine imports. The US government moved to impose punitive duties on Argentine soybean oil imports into the US recently, then has tried to move mandate levels to reflect the reduced feedstock supply. The latter move has failed as the government said Friday that mandate levels will be maintained or expanded and not cut back in any way.<br />Harvest weather should be good this week in the Midwest after weekend rains as forecasts call for cool and dry conditions. There are still forecasts around for weather patterns to change in Brazil and bring some badly needed rain to the north and drier conditions to the south and into Argentina. The US harvest has been more active in areas east of the Mississippi River and is starting to finish in these areas, while areas to the west of the river are expanding.<br />The yield data generally runs behind year-ago levels, but are still very strong overall. Basis levels have started to improve as the river levels move higher due to recent rains, although basis levels have been weak in the Gulf of Mexico. It remains too dry for best planting in the northern half of Brazil, while the southern half of Brazil and the northern half of Argentina get too much rain. It is planting time for Soybeans there, but progress is very slow right now. Ideas are that the weather patterns there can start to change and more favorable planting weather will be seen near the end of the month.<br />Weekly Chicago Soybeans Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Chicago Soybean Meal Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Rice<br />Rice closed higher on Friday, but lower for the week. The daily charts still show futures prices locked in a short-term trading range. The sales report last week was strong and were especially strong for long grain into Latin America. That demand news has been great for the market. Latin American buyers in recent years have complained about the quality of the US crop and have bought more and more from Brazil or elsewhere in Latin America. The strong sales now show that the US quality is very good this year and also that the US is featuring competitive prices into these regions.<br />Domestic cash market conditions are generally quiet. The Delta harvest is about over and as farmers are holding out for higher prices. California has significant harvest progress to make now. Reports from the country indicate good to very good yields and quality for the Delta as the harvest comes to a close in most areas. Yields in California right now are lower than hoped for as the late start to planting appears to have created a short season and less yield potential. Domestic cash quotes have held generally steady amid little interest in the Delta and are called firm in California.<br />Weekly Chicago Rice Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Palm Oil and Vegetable Oils<br />Palm oil futures moved a little higher last week, and weekly charts show that the market remains in a trading range. The market moved higher as data released by the private sources showed that exports for the first half of the month were very strong. Both showed that exports this month are at least 10% higher than last month. China is back and buying now and demand could get stronger.<br />Canola was higher on a weaker Canadian dollar and despite increased farm selling and active harvest activity. Farmers have started to more actively sell and deliver as the harvest starts to move into its final stages. Yield reports yet imply a good but not great crop in just about all areas of the Prairies.<br />Soybean oil was also higher. The US government moved to impose punitive duties on Argentine soybean oil imports into the US recently, then has tried to move mandate levels to reflect the reduced feedstock supply. The latter move has failed as the government said Friday that mandate levels will be maintained or expanded and not cut back in any way. Ideas are that US domestic soybean oil demand can stay strong.<br />Weekly Malaysian Palm Oil Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Chicago Soybean Oil Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Canola Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Cotton<br />Cotton was lower last week as a big crop of good quality is being harvested. Even improved export sales could not support the market last week as the amount sold was not exceptional for this time of year at under 400,000 bales. The classing report released on Friday shows that quality is holding after the hurricanes seen in Texas and the Southeast this summer. The harvest still has a long way to go, but the quality is good and there is a lot of cotton that will have to come to the market sooner or later. Futures appear to be turning trends down again, and tests of 6500 December and perhaps near 6000 December are possible now.<br />Harvest is more active and will continue to expand as more and more of the crop comes to maturity. Bolls are opening now in just about all production areas, but harvest remains a little behind normal. West Texas conditions are called good and the Southwest should be good despite hot weather this year. There is strong production potential in Asia, and mostly in India and Pakistan due to improved monsoon rains. However, the rains were variable, with some areas getting flooding rains and others, not enough rain. Some rains are expected in most areas this week amid relatively moderate temperatures. Chinese growing conditions are good. Areas in southern Russia and surrounding nations are in good condition.<br />Weekly US Cotton Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice and Citrus<br />FCOJ closed higher and appear to be developing a trading range. The market has not been able to fill a gap left in reaction to Irma and the losses seen in Florida as a result of the devastating storm. Futures are still reacting to the USDA reports that showed big production loss potential from the hurricane, but not the losses expected by the trade. USDA is expected by many to show further dramatic cuts in production in coming reports.<br />Ideas remain that the orange groves are badly damaged in Florida due to Irma. Crops in many areas were almost completely destroyed. Other areas suffered losses of 50% or more of the crop. Some growers say that trees will be stressed again next year due to the winds and rains from Irma. The demand side remains weak and there are plenty of supplies in the US. Trees that are still alive now are showing fruits of good sizes, although many have lost a lot of the fruit. Brazil crops are stressed from the hot and dry weather.<br />Weekly FCOJ Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Coffee<br />Futures were lower in New York and in London last week, with commercials scale down buyers and speculators still the best sellers, but now on both sides of the market. The trends are down on the charts in New York as traders look at the potential for a big crop in Brazil. London trends are sideways. The Brazil weather and tree condition is the main fundamental reason for lower New York prices but could become the major reason to buy the market soon.<br />Rains appeared in Brazil a couple of weeks ago, then it turned dry again. These rains promoted flowering, and some reports indicate that flowering has been very good. Other areas have seen good flowering but might not see much fruit as the trees have defoliated due to earlier stress. The current dry period is causing some to wonder if the flowers will start to abort.<br />There are some forecasts for rains early this week, but amounts and coverage forecasts have faded as the event draws closer. The rains will need to continue and be in good amounts as it has been very dry and trees have been stressed for a ear or more in some cases. Some were stressed after the production last year, while others suffered due to the dry and cold winter. Even so, improved weather now could mean a very good crop, although most likely not a huge crop of over 50 million bags.<br />Cash market conditions in Central America are more active as the next harvest continues. There is coffee to sell and offers are on the table for the next crop. Differentials have been stable but weak in the region. Colombia has reported some difficult growing conditions, but exports have held well as production appears to be good. Differentials have been stable and relatively strong.<br />Weekly New York Arabica Coffee Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly London Robusta Coffee Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Sugar<br />Futures were a little lower in New York and in London, and price trends remain sideways in both markets. Both markets held support areas on the weekly charts, but remain locked in sideways trends as ideas of big production go against hopes for improved demand. Brazil has been hot and dry, but some rains are in the forecast for early this week. No one is talking about production losses yet, but many are watching the situation. The market expects firmer prices over time as the Indian harvest could be delayed due to wet conditions that would delay sugarcane harvesting.<br />There are questions about the Indian production this year as the distribution on monsoon rains was not uniform. Some areas saw flooding rains while others got well below normal totals. The monsoon is starting to recede now. Overall upside potential is limited as there are still projections for a surplus in the world production, and these projections for the surplus seem to be getting bigger over time. Production potential in Thailand seems strong as monsoon rains have been better than last year. However, buying from the Far East has often gone to India lately as Thai differentials have been high.<br />Weekly New York World Raw Sugar Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly London White Sugar Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Cocoa<br />Futures closed a Little lower on Friday, but higher for the week in response to positive demand news from as the North American grind data last week and the European grind data the previous week. The North American data did show an increase in demand, but not as much as some traders had hoped for. The trends are now up in New York and in London on both the daily and weekly charts, although the weekly charts show that some important resistance is just ahead at about 2180 New York December.<br />Traders saw positive grind data from Asia on Friday. World production ideas remain high. Harvest reports show that good to very good production will be seen this year in West Africa. Ghana and Ivory Coast expects a very good crop this year. Nigeria and Cameroon are reporting good yields on the initial harvest, and also good quality. The growing conditions in other parts of the world are generally good. East Africa is getting better rains now. Good conditions are still seen in Southeast Asia. Traders talk of increased demand to go against big world production as prices are now attractive for grinders and chocolate manufacturers.<br />Weekly New York Cocoa Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly London Cocoa Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Dairy and Meat<br />Dairy markets were sharply lower again last week and Milk futures made new lows for the move. The Global Dairy Auction was weaker last week. USDA reports ample supplies, but good to very good demand in just about all parts of the US. Milk and cheese demand has been mixed, but Butter demand has weakened and prices in this market have moved sharply lower. Demand is good for cream, but cream has generally been available to meet the demand.<br />Cream demand for butter has been very good. Demand for ice cream has been mixed depending on the region but is holding well due to mild weather in much of the US. Cheese demand still appears to be weaker and inventories appear high. US production conditions have featured some abnormally hot weather in the west that is hurting milk production. Production in the rest of the country has been strong.<br />US cattle and beef prices were lower, but futures held up trends. Beef prices remain firm, and cattle traded about #2.00 per hundredweight higher last week. Ideas are that packers are still enjoying very strong margins at this time and can afford to pay more for cattle. This did happen last week. The beef market was somewhat better last week to support ideas that prices for cattle could continue to improve.<br />Cattle prices were steady to slightly weaker in early dealings and amid lighter than expected volume. It is the threat of increased supplies down the road that keeps the packers from buying aggressively. Feedlots are full, but ideas are that the big offer of cattle has passed. The monthly cattle on feed report on Friday showed big placements, so prices should move lower this week in both live cattle and feeder cattle futures.<br />Pork markets and lean hogs futures were higher. Ideas are that futures are reflecting the weaker supply and demand fundamentals now, but the overall market seems to be improving. Demand has been improved for the last couple of weeks and this has affected pricing. There are still ideas of bug supplies out there, but the market seems to have the supply side priced. The weekly charts show that the market is trying to form a low at current prices, and futures have been cheap enough that a low is possible at this time. The weekly charts suggest that futures are completing an important bottom in prices at this time.<br />Weekly Chicago Class 3 Milk Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Chicago Cheese Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Chicago Butter Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Chicago Live Cattle Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Feeder Cattle Futures © Jack Scoville<br />Weekly Chicago Lean Hog Futures © Jack Scoville<br />-<br />DISCLAIMER: This article expresses my own ideas and opinions.

0e5b57ee6d,What Is PU (Polyurethane) Leather Vs Real Leather - Science Trends,"What Is PU (Polyurethane) Leather Vs Real Leather - Science Trends<br />There are different kinds of products referred to as \""leather\"", but do you know the difference between PU leather (polyurethane leather) and real leather? Polyurethane leather is a leather-like polymer substance made out of polyurethane, a type of plastic. Meanwhile, real leather comes from the hide of animals.That\'s the basic difference between polyurethane leather and real leather, but let\'s take a closer look at the two different forms of leather.Characteristics of Polyurethane LeatherThere are various types of artificial leather, and PU leather is only one kind. Other kinds of artificial leather include PVC leather. Some forms of faux leather are even made out of substances like oak trees and kelp. Polyurethane leather was created to have the same look and feel of leather, but without using actual animal skin.The most common way of creating PU leather is to use the plastic polyurethane coating and apply it to a base made out of fiber (usually polyester). PU leather might be combined with real leather in a form called bi-cast leather. Bi-cast leather may use a split leather base which is then covered with a PVC or PU layer.Photo: Holger Casselmann via Wikimedia Commons, CC 3.0Polyurethane leather typically has the same general feel of leather, but it\'s typically a little lighter than genuine leather. Polyurethane isn\'t quite as durable as real leather and tends to tear more easily, though it also doesn\'t crack or fade when exposed to sunlight as some real leathers can. This is why it is frequently used for automobiles.Polyurethane leather can also be produced in a wider variety of colors, patterns, and styles than real leather can. It\'s also easy to apply a glossy finish to it. In terms of maintenance, PU leather rarely requires much maintenance and can usually just be wiped down with a damp rag.Polyurethane leather may have some environmental benefits over real leather. PU leather obviously doesn\'t require animals to create, and unlike real leather, it doesn\'t need to be tanned. The tanning of leather can create considerable pollution from the chemicals used to create it, such as chromium and ammonia. On the other hand, PU leather isn\'t as biodegradable as real leather.In contrast to real leather, PU leather isn\'t as breathable. It\'s more breathable than other types of synthetic leather, such as PVC, however. While real leather tends to get better looking and softer over time, this isn\'t true of PU leather, which will maintain a consistent look and feel throughout its life. Finally, PU leather tends to be substantially cheaper than real leather.You can usually distinguish PU leather from genuine leather by checking either the price or the label. The price will usually be much cheaper on PU leather items, and if the item has a label on it, it may say PU or Polyurethane. A close look at the item may also reveal if the leather is genuine or artificial, as the pores of the animal\'s skin are only present on real leather. Finally, try smelling the leather item, if there\'s a distinct plastic-y smell, it is probably PU leather.Characteristics Of Genuine LeatherGenuine leather is made from the skin of animals, frequently cows, deer, and horses. The skin of the animal needs to be tanned to be turned into useable leather, and this is done at a tannery. There are various kinds of tanning processes, chrome tanning and vegetable tanning are the most popular.Chrome tanning is typically regarded as the most efficient process and it uses the chemical chromium sulfate to make the leather more durable.Leather is used in a wide variety of items, from clothes to books to furniture. Genuine leather can last a long time, and it typically gains a pleasing patina as it ages. Genuine leather is very durable and can last between 10 to 20 years if properly maintained. In contrast, PU leather can begin to crack and crease in only a few years. Genuine leather is difficult to tear or puncture, and it is also much more breathable than most artificial leather.Photo: terimakasih0 via PixabaySome real leathers possess hypoallergenic traits, meaning they repel certain allergens. In contrast, faux leather lacks hypoallergenic traits.Maintenance for leather is a little more involved than maintenance for PU leather. It can be cleaned with water or soap on a damp rag, but if oil or sweat has stained it will need to be cleaned with a special leather cleaner. Genuine leather may need to have a leather conditioner applied from time to time to keep it supple, or else it will become stiff or brittle. This is because the natural oils within the leather dry out after time.In terms of how environmentally friendly real leather is, there are multiple things to consider. Real leather is more biodegradable than artificial leather, but as previously mentioned there are many hazardous chemicals used in the tanning of real leather that can be very pollutive. On the other hand, because leather lasts longer than artificial leather less waste may be produced as a byproduct.Pros And Cons Of PU LeatherPros:PU leather is much cheaper than genuine leather PU leather can be produced in a wide variety of colors and styles PU leather is easy to clean and maintain with just a damp cloth PU leather is resistant to UV rays, so it doesn\'t fade as easily PU leather doesn\'t dry out over time like genuine leather PU leather doesn\'t require animals to makeCons:PU leather isn\'t very breathable when compared to real leather PU leather doesn\'t develop the patina or luster of genuine leather over time PU leather doesn\'t have the hypoallergenic traits real leather does PU leather is easily damaged, it can be punctured or torn more easily than real leather PU leather doesn\'t last as long as real leather canPros And Cons Of Genuine LeatherPros:Genuine leather is much more breathable than real leather Genuine leather develops a notable patina and luster over time Genuine leather has hypoallergenic qualities Genuine leather is very durable and resistant to puncturing or tearing Genuine leather lasts much longer than PU leatherCons:Genuine leather is much more expensive than PU leather Genuine leather can only be produced in a few styles or colors Genuine leather needs more maintenance than PU leather Genuine leather gets discolored or cracked by UV radiation Genuine leather dries out over time and needs to be maintained Opinions expressed are solely the authors and do not express the views or opinions of Science Trends nor the author\'s institution.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH1om66gzp0GjwnN7q6cUgt16MqCg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=o5DZWuDfKYrZzQal9a3gCQ&url=https://sciencetrends.com/what-is-pu-polyurethane-leather-vs-real-leather/,EN,,20/04/2018 07:02,2018-04-19 15:36:00+00:00,51fe179e08,Science Trends,,,,,1524159360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f2acb1c963,Love Hormone and Falling in Love - MedIndia,"Love Hormone and Falling in Love<br />Ever wondered why the famous words, \'I Love you\' warm the cockles of your heart? Can love, which has tickled the creative juices of artists, poets and writers to produce masterpieces, be born merely out of instinct? Can we pin this life-altering emotion to a play of chemicals and hormones in the body? Discover what makes for the inextricable bonding of love and life! Love - an intense, universal and immensely intriguing emotion that knows no barriers of time, geography, race, sex and culture, is a famous expression of profound affection, caring and attachment. Eulogized as life\'s driving force and clichd as \'making the world go round\' or \'doing strange things to people\', it is famously known to blind those it envelops! This mind boggling emotion is versatile too as it fits in different contexts - As much as \'love\' can imply fondness for an object, it can also be used to express profound feelings in a relationship. One can also love his fellow beings, or passionately love a cause!Manifestations of Love Unraveling this emotion led to detailed analysis of its varied forms - love can be romantic, platonic, interpersonal and even impersonal. To offer a peek, the love between lovers is romantic love, spurred on by physical attraction. Love which is devoid of romantic or sexual overtones, for instance love between friends is considered a platonic form of love. Bonding between family members or the deep attachment between mother and child is interpersonal love.Impersonal love denotes love for a cause or a principle, close to one\'s heart. One can love a hobby, their job, or love material objects and attach great value to it.Why we love .....The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread. ~ Mother Teresa.... The need to be loved is as basic and indispensable as any other human need, like hunger, thirst, warmth and sleep, say analysts. Renowned anthropologist, Dr Helen Fisher whose pet subject \'love\' led to extensive research on the evolution of love, has called it a \'natural phenomenon\'. A famous author of many books on \'Love\', Dr Fisher explains the emotion to be extensions of lust, attraction and attachment, which influences our preferences of a mate and drive for sex.In one such interesting work of hers, titled \'Why we Love\', she delves into the tell tale signs of someone in a romantic relationship. Her insight reveals the journey of romantic love and lust. According to her, romantic love begins with physical attraction while lust is a powerful sexual desire which is fleeting and lasts anywhere between a few weeks to months. On the other hand, attachment denotes a sense of commitment in the relationship, born out of intense love and affection. Neurobiology of Love People in love could experience mood swings, sleeplessness, racing heart beat, loss of appetite and are generally lost in their own world. So much so one can easily spot love\'s countenance. Now, Neuroscience makes sense of this \'heady\' state of love....When two people fall madly in love, the brain\'s pleasure centers are activated causing the release of few chemicals-dopamine, pheromones and serotonin. These chemicals are directly responsible for excitement, increased heart rate, lack of appetite and sleeplessness. New love is more \'physical\', according to neuroscientists who studied the brain scans of those in love. As the relationship progressed, the regions in the brain associated with long term commitment, attachment and love, began to witness activity marking the beginning of lifetime bonds. Scientists also found evidence that love is a fundamental need, akin to hunger, thirst and sleep. The regions in the brain activated during hunger and thirst were similar to the pattern of brain activity found among those in love. Need we search more to know why love and life are inextricably linked? The Hormone of Love - Oxytocin Oxytocin, now dubbed as the \'hormone of love\', or the \'cuddle hormone\' is a chemical produced by the hypothalamus in the brain and released by the pituitary gland, in response to certain environmental triggers such as stimulation of the cervix during sex, skin to skin contact, during childbirth or even during nipple stimulation in lactating women. The testes of men and ovaries of women also produce this hormone. Oxytocin is directly responsible for \'pair bonding\' - the bonding between mothers and infants, or between males and females. Oxytocin also plays a crucial role in the sexual response cycle. During sex, the mere act of touching or caressing, causes a spike in the oxytocin levels in the body. Rightly called as a catalyst in sex, it ensures the body is both psychologically and physically aroused. Oxytocin triggers penile erections. Oxytocin is also released during orgasm in both men and women. The release of oxytocin during sexual intercourse forges bonding between sexual partners. Further, having sex with the same partner repeatedly causes the release of oxytocin in abundance, sometimes by mere sight of the partner. Oxytocin inspires attachment and influences our choice of partner over other prospects. Easily, the love hormone lays the foundation of lifetime bonds. Oxytocin Shapes Maternal behavior Oxytocin\'s role is mission critical during childbirth. During labor, a woman\'s body is flushed with oxytocin. This triggers contraction of the uterine walls and prepares the body for childbirth. Post delivery, Oxytocin plays a role in milk letdown in lactating mothers. Perhaps the best from oxytocin is its role in defining maternal behavior. Research has linked the origin of maternal behavior to this love hormone. To verify the role of oxytocin in the establishment of initial bond between the mother and the new born, experiments were conducted on female rats to check the outcome of inhibiting the release of oxytocin. Those female rats, in which oxytocin release was inhibited, began to desert their newborns. On the contrary, when virgin female rats were given oxytocin shots, they began to portray maternal behavior towards offsprings of other rats, caring for them like their own. Those who thought \'Love\' is beyond the realm of science and reason might need to rethink. It is clear, the \'out of the world experience\', Love, is not beyond the human brain. Rightly, falling in love is just a matter of chemistry!Source: MedindiaSAVITHA/LAdvertisement",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEv6GETAPs8YaNON-w-_WuFL9gryg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=brhbV7DqAYzmzAbf6oOwBQ&url=http://www.medindia.net/news/lifestyleandwellness/love-hormone-and-falling-in-love-43593-1.htm,EN,,11/06/2016 07:13,2008-11-03 01:45:49+00:00,f64c8d16bc,MedIndia,,,,,1225680349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Icelandic sheep, the original highland hikers 
The Icelandic sheep are let loose in the mountains every summer, this is a tradition over a thousand years old. Meanwhile the grass grows in peace in the lowlands, and is then harvested to feed the sheep over the winter. 
Over the centuries the sheep have created an elaborate system of paths in the highlands, called f rg tur. If you have come across them, you might think that they ve been made by hikers. That s not the case, human s aren t so organized that they take exactly the same path year after year. 
Fj rg tur lie on the side of hills, in a valley, leading to an easy passage over a stream. They mark a line in an area covered with moss and heather. Some refer to fj rg tur as a scar on Icelandic nature, but they can also be seen as a witness to Icelandic agriculture. 
They are very handy for a human hiker travelling in the highlands. Fj rg tur are roads through rough areas or through thick vegetation ( on Icelandic standards ). 
In this video made by Icelandic Lamb, you can see the `` sheep network ''.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGyxxETIxeUU-p3T9Me4VF0ELkQHw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779416928713&ei=WwDFWMjNCJWsWOm_lqAJ&url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/nature_and_travel/2017/03/11/icelandic_sheep_the_original_highland_hikers/,EN,,12/03/2017 08:04,2017-03-11 18:24:00+00:00,7903d30a98,Iceland Monitor,,,,,1489260240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f2b85d78df,The lost weekend: Unplugged from the internet - Lewiston Sun Journal,"The lost weekend: Unplugged from the internet<br />The nights were the worst.<br />With all fast asleep within the house around me, it seemed as though the entirety of the remaining world was trapped within the hard metal shell of my desktop computer.<br />The emails, the text messages, the Facebook wall posts. The up-to-the-minute news updates in perhaps the most eventful time in human history.<br />The streaming television. The 24-hour Christmas morning that is Amazon. The YouTube - dear God, how I missed YouTube and the time-sucking variety offered therein.<br />I could have none of it - not on my desktop machine, not on my phone, not on some tablet, phablet or Kindle. No internet for me, my friend, and by extension, no television. I had taken a vow of abstinence, and while it was only two days and two nights of web-free living, the pain set in fast.<br />Let me make one thing clear: I\'m not that guy you see out in public, phone in hand and all attention directed there. When I\'m out of the house, I rarely miss the internet at all. I welcome road trips as time away from the magnetic attraction of email and Facebook, and from the endless nags of the connected world.<br />At home, though? When the work is done and all I have are long hours to fill? Give me my internet, bro, and keep it coming. A sitcom on Netflix here, some deep nerd research there. Maybe a few hours of history, political analysis and videos of people getting hit in their groins on YouTube. The internet means instant gratification and knowledge on command. Now I was going without and the aforementioned pain made itself known in an exciting variety of ways.<br />THE DAWNING: MOTORCYCLE HAND GRIPS<br />Saturday afternoon, working on my motorcycle in the yard. I noticed that my hand grips were worn down to nothing and decided to get some new ones at once. Amazon would have been an easy way to go, but no. Amazon resides on the internet and thus, to me, it was verboten. I\'d have to go to a local brick-and-mortar store, but was it open?<br />In any internet browser these days, you can pop in the name of pretty much any business, big or small, and its hours of operation will appear on the very first page. Handy stuff. That\'s how you find out whether George\'s Pizza is open when you have a hankering for pie at 2 in the morning. It\'s how you come to know it\'s no use making the trip to Home Depot at 10:01 p.m. on a Sunday when you need an emergency ballcock spring for the toilet.<br />So, I needed to know if the motorcycle store was open, but I couldn\'t look it up. Just give them a call, right? Sure, if I had the phone number. But since I began using phone books as kindling around 2002, something as simple as a phone number was beyond my reach. Was there still such a thing as \""Information\""? Just dial 411 and ask for the number?<br />Moot point, as it turns out. Since my phone is connected to the internet, I had shut it off, and this house hasn\'t been equipped with a land line in 10 years or more. My options were to find an old-fashioned phone booth with the phone book still intact or just take a ride over to the bike store and see if I could open the door.<br />Which is what I did. It had closed roughly two minutes before I arrived.<br />Both Saturday and Sunday morning I read the newspaper cover to cover. This is how I got my news all weekend. Since we ditched cable a couple years ago -settling for web-based programming - I couldn\'t even fall back on TV news sources I generally dislike during my lost weekend. No CNN, no FOX, no nothing.<br />It made me think about a time before the internet and before 24-hour news cycles. Back in the day, one got news in daily doses via the newspaper, or tuned in for the evening news on television. By today\'s standards, news traveled at a glacial pace. And if you go back to the period before television, it was slower still. How did they cope, I wondered, without minute-to-minute updates, the bulk of them completely unsubstantiated and transmitted snarkily via Twitter?<br />Reading the newspaper was nice and nostalgic, but still I felt the tidal tug of technology. It was the small stuff, mostly.<br />I stumbled upon the Dear Abby column but noticed that some other lady was writing it. Whatever happened to Abigail Van Buren, I wondered? Was she dead? On strike? In prison?<br />Who cared, really? But when I remembered that I couldn\'t look it up until Monday, suddenly it seemed like I HAD to know. Something as simple as a 10-second Google search was now forbidden, which turned an insignificant piece of information into something pressing and out of reach, like an inner itch.<br />The Sunday paper was a blessing. It filled chunks of time I normally would have spent slumped at my desk, robotically scrolling web pages. The Sunday paper is absolutely jam packed with news and entertainment, yet its offerings are finite. No hyper links, no auto-play videos, no email addresses to which to fire off instant rebuttals.<br />I read a guest column by Lewiston lawyer Elliott Epstein and was stirred by the subject on which he wrote. I had thoughts. Deep thoughts, and wanted to write him at once to commend his analysis and offer my own. But without access to the internet, what was I going to do? Sit down and hand write a letter to the attorney? Tuck my thoughts away until Monday and hope that my passion for the task would survive that long?<br />The internet allows us to react instantly to the things that move us. That can be a great thing or a terrible thing, depending on what that reaction is and whether you were sober when you made it. In my case, it was nothing at all - by the time the internet embargo was over, my thoughts on Epstein\'s column had faded to a barely remembered rant in a quiet corner of my mind. What were those thoughts again? Something about the sacrosanct nature of private property? Without the internet, whatever ideas I had on the matter were not registered on the permanent record that is the net.<br />Later. Night again. The internet Jones was upon me. I missed YouTube like a vanquished lover. Had Stefan Molyneaux posted a new video today? Was Jonathan Turley opining about legal matters? What were the latest developments in Syria? What about North Korea? China? Russia? Turkey?<br />There were rumblings about gunfire in Lewiston and someone had mentioned something about a blaze at Burger King. Surely the Sun Journal would have stories up on the web and there was no doubt buzzing to be had on Facebook. Not for me, though. There might be a hundred updates in my email and a dozen secret squirrel tips in my Facebook private message folder, but they might as well have been on the moon. Through the simple act of yanking the ethernet cord out of my computer, I had reduced my own capacity for telecommunication to 1989 levels. I had slammed the prison door of isolation behind me.<br />RABBIT EARS TO THE RESCUE?<br />What I wouldn\'t have given for an hour of Netflix. Just a bunch of \""Cheers\"" reruns would have served as a fine distraction, or maybe I could take a look at the \""13 Reasons Why\"" clip that had people in such a stir.<br />Inspired, it occurred to me that I had a TV antenna kicking around somewhere; just a cheap little unit I could screw into the television to access local channels. I dug it out from beneath the bed, clawing for it like a junkie tearing into his stash. I screwed it in, aimed the other end toward the southern sky, and waited for the entertainment void to be filled.<br />The world opened by the TV antenna was surreal. \""Wonder Woman\"" reruns and \""Night Court\"" and \""Columbo.\"" The images were jumpy and prone to freezing. The broadcasts were plagued by endless commercials that seemed to spring out of the mid-1970s. Ronco is still selling knives? Enjoli perfume is still a thing?<br />Frustrated, I flicked through the channels until I found some NHL Stanley Cup action. The Capitols vs. The Penguins! Bingo! Weekend saved!<br />But the broadcast was junk. It would freeze and stutter and break apart at key moments. I found myself standing on a chair, holding the antenna high above my head and doing a strange dance in a mostly vain effort to restore order to the hockey game. This was the kind of thing TV enthusiasts had to endure back when \""All in the Family\"" was an edgy new sitcom on CBS.<br />I found my low point. Had I become so addicted to the white noise of entertainment that I couldn\'t handle two nights of relative silence?<br />I flung the antenna into a closet and shut down the TV. I went into another room and picked up a paperback novel, marveling over it as though it was an ancient artifact from a forgotten epoch. In a time before the internet had annihilated my attention span, I used to read two or three of these suckers a week. Now, to my great shame, resigning myself to the reading of mere paper and ink felt like punishment.<br />In an attempt to escape the allure of the internet, I traveled all the way back to the 1960s hippie generation. I joined a crowd of dropped-out hedonists, traveling the country by boxcar, drinking wine on beaches and pontificating on all of life\'s great mysteries. The whole time, the internet tugged at me.<br />Reading Kerouac\'s \""The Dharma Bums\"" at 10 p.m. (it felt like 3 a.m.) I came across a line about a young beat poet who had purchased all his clothes at Goodwill. Gee, I thought. How long has Goodwill been around? My impulse was to go look it up. Once I remembered that I couldn\'t do so, I suddenly wanted to look up the history of Goodwill reeeeeally bad. I mean, it seemed all at once like a matter of life and death, and the fact that I couldn\'t just pop onto Google to find the answer was maddening. It was like an itch in my amygdala.<br />THE RUINS OF OUR CYBER ADDICTION<br />How did one answer such pointless questions back in the day? Did they wait until Monday so they could go to the library and search for information that way? Did they go to the nearest Goodwill store and ask a harried clerk about the origins of the organization?<br />When I was a kid, half of everything I learned came from the encyclopedia. Need to know the chief export of Guam at 4 in the morning? Britannica had you covered. On fire with wonder about the circumference of the moon? Check the volume M-N and you\'d find your answer. Back in the day, the encyclopedia was the internet, one without the clutter of Tweets, pop-up ads and cat memes. The sad fact is, like the painfully absent phone book, I don\'t have any encyclopedias anymore either.<br />If the world wide web ever crashes into cyber dust, knowledge will fly away from us like frightened bats. We\'ve become so hooked on the easy access to everything it provides, surely our brains are less adroit than they used to be. Surely we remember less because we are no longer required to - why commit a phone number to memory when you can easily store it in your cloud-based address book, available anywhere you go? Why remember facts and figures when you can jot them down in Evernote, to be accessed again only when that information is needed.<br />In the end, I spent my final hours of unconnected existence grumbling over the pathetic nature of cyber addiction. Bored to fury, I cleaned everything in sight, sweeping and mopping areas that hadn\'t seen sunlight in 25 years. I fixed things that weren\'t broken. I cleaned and organized my closet and drawers, to the point where my socks are now arranged alphabetically. I did productive things, and resented doing them rather than delighting in the fact that I have been given a gift of silence and free time.<br />Weird business, addiction.<br />Ironically, I had originally intended to make my break from the internet a week long, or even two - a longer spell would have provided more opportunity for adjustment and adaptation. Who knows? After such a long stretch without the distraction of the web, I might be writing poetry by now, or painting great art or building a better mousetrap.<br />Alas, a longer stretch was not possible because without the internet, I wouldn\'t be able to do my job, and how sad is that? Back in the mid-\'90s, I did just fine with a notebook, a Rolodex, microfilm for background research and a hard-wired telephone. These days? A good 75 percent of all my communication is done through email or social media, and just about all research is done through online search engines. Breaking news isn\'t scribbled in a notebook, it\'s posted at once to the web. It\'s an online business in a hyper-connected world.<br />So, Monday morning I got up and plugged that ethernet cord back into the computer. The internet was back in an instant, and with it all the brain-cluttering aggravations that go with it. A dozen emails that demanded immediate response, the bink of incoming text messages and bonk of new voicemails. There were Facebook messages to be read, reminders of bills due, nags from the bank, nags from work, nags from people I didn\'t want to talk to.<br />While I had spent the weekend missing the good things the internet has to offer, I had forgotten to also savor the silence of its absence. Sighing, feeling no relief at being connected again, I got about dutifully answering those messages that needed to be addressed. If only I could make swift work of them, I might find enough time left in the day to order that ballcock spring on Amazon.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHDrliKy4bpJ3k3Vh7Ib1QxPzwyPg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=8cYOWYj9DcPyWPv4v9gK&url=http://www.sunjournal.com/news/bplus/2017/05/07/lost-weekend-unplugged-internet/2122052,EN,,07/05/2017 07:03,2017-05-07 02:11:03+00:00,5b41d61294,Lewiston Sun Journal,,,,,1494130263,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f2cc81fdc5,More than 60 people dead after shopping mall fire in Russia; alarms never went off - Fox 59,"More than 60 people dead after shopping mall fire in Russia; alarms never went off<br />MOSCOW (AP) - With the fire alarms silent and staff reportedly nowhere to be seen, a fire at a shopping mall packed with children and their parents on the first weekend of the school recess killed 64 people in Russia\'s Siberia.<br />The fire at the Winter Cherry mall in Kemerovo, a city about 3,000 kilometers (1,900 miles) east of Moscow, was extinguished by Monday morning after burning through the night. Firefighters were still recovering bodies as parts of the buildings were still smoldering. Some of the dead were found inside a cinema, which one witness said had been locked shut.<br />Investigators said Monday that emergency exits were blocked and a security guard turned off the public announcement system when he received a call about the blaze.<br />On Monday morning, Kemerovo residents were bringing flowers, candles and stuffed animals to a plaza outside the mall, and local hospitals reported an influx of people wanting to donate blood for the victims.<br />Sixty-four deaths were confirmed after the firefighters finished combing through the four floors of the mall, Emergency Situations Minister Vladimir Puchkov told a televised briefing. Six of the bodies have not yet been recovered. Puchkov would not immediately say how many of the victims were children as only 17 people have been identified.<br />Twelve people have been hospitalized. Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova, who visited the Keremovo hospital where the victims were receiving treatment, said on Russian state television that the patient in the gravest condition is an 11-year-old boy who jumped out of a window from the fourth floor. The boy\'s parents and younger sister died in the fire, Skvortsova said.<br />Some 200 animals are also believed to have died in the mall\'s petting zoo. The zoo\'s manager told the Tass news agency that the animals included rabbits, turtles, pigs, goats and rodents.<br />Russia\'s top investigative body said Monday afternoon that they are searching for a security officer who appears to have turned off the PA system when he received a call about the blaze.<br />Four people have been detained in connection with the deadly, fire including one of the mall\'s tenants. The investigators did not give the cause of the fire but said they have obtained evidence proving \""flagrant violations\"" that could have contributed to the heavy loss of life, including the fact that the fire escapes were blocked.<br />Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday it was too early to draw conclusions about whether local officials failed in Kemerovo.<br />Witness testimony indicated that the fire alarm did not go off and that staff did not arrange for the evacuation at the shopping mall, which was converted from a former confectionery factory in 2013.<br />Winter Cherry was one of Kemerovo\'s most popular entertainment centers for children, with its own indoor skating rink, petting zoo and trampolines. Kemerovo residents said the mall was packed with children and their parents.<br />The Ekho Mosvky radio station on Monday quoted witnesses who said the fire alarm did not go off and that the mall\'s staff did not organize the evacuation.<br />Anna Zarechneva who was on the top floor where the fire started, watching a movie with her husband and son, said they only found out about the fire when a man ran into the theater shouting.<br />\""We didn\'t hear the fire alarm, they even didn\'t turn on the light during the show,\"" she said. \""That movie could have been the last for us, I\'ve only just realized that.\""<br />Alexander Lillevyali lost three daughters, 11-year-old twins and a 5-year-old, who were in a cinema hall on the top floor watching a cartoon.<br />Lillevyali told the Meduza news website that one of his daughters called him, saying that they could smell the smoke but could not get out because the door was locked.<br />\""I was shouting into the phone, telling her to get out but there was nothing I could do - the fire was in front of me,\"" he said.<br />The Prosecutor General\'s Office on Monday ordered all shopping malls in Russia to be checked for fire safety features.<br />Russian companies routinely complain about excessive checks from various government agencies, which often abuse elaborate rules and regulations to pressure businesses. As a result, many companies prefer to pay bribes instead of complying with outdated and excessive regulations, including fire safety rules.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEQfYJje7kwC697XnWIeOwdp7GehA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779846904213&ei=fj67WqiPPMjBzQaL4r_gAQ&url=http://fox59.com/2018/03/26/more-than-60-people-dead-after-shopping-mall-fire-in-russia-alarms-never-went-off/,EN,,28/03/2018 07:01,2018-03-26 07:30:17+00:00,7903d30a98,Fox 59,,,,,1522056617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f2d5de77fd,Grim autopsies and heavy metaphors in Taylor Sheridan\'s Wind River - New Statesman,"Grim autopsies and heavy metaphors in Taylor Sheridan\'s Wind River<br />According to the story, God created Adam and Eve in a garden where they could eat freely from all but one of the trees. Entranced by a serpent, which told her that disobeying the divine prohibition would make them like gods, Eve ate fruit from the forbidden tree and gave it to Adam, who also ate it. Their eyes were opened and, realising that they were naked, they covered themselves with fig leaves. The punishment exacted by God was that they were expelled from the garden and forced to labour until they died, when they returned to the dust from which they had been made.<br />How could a tale featuring these incredible events have seized the imagination for so long? As interpreted by Christians, the lesson it conveyed is barely coherent. Why would a benign God deny any knowledge of good and evil to the creatures it had created and then, when they acquired such knowledge, condemn them to a life of misery? If this God was omniscient, it knew in advance that they would breach the prohibition. The first humans, on the other hand, were too innocent to understand the punishment that God threatened; they knew nothing of death or labour, by which they would be cursed when they were expelled from the garden. A God that devised and enacted such a cruel drama would be a capricious tyrant, wreaking senseless suffering on the world it had created.<br />Yet the story lived on, inspiring some of the greatest poets and painters. As the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Harvard humanities professor Stephen Greenblatt shows in this pellucid, absorbing and for many contemporary readers surely definitive account, the biblical image of Adam and Eve was repeatedly transformed in Western art. In Renaissance Europe, the lifelike naked figures of the 15th-century Flemish master Jan van Eyck - showing Adam\'s hands reddened from labour and Eve\'s prominent belly - became in Albrecht Dürer\'s engraving The Fall of Man (1504) an incarnation of perfect beauty in a world that had not yet fallen into sinfulness and mortality. In Milton\'s Paradise Lost - \""the greatest poem in the English language\"", as Greenblatt and many others believe - the Genesis story was transmuted into a tragedy shaped by Satan\'s pride and the mutual love of Adam and Eve.<br />All of these artists struggled with a Christian orthodoxy that asserted that the Genesis story was literally true. But for many centuries, the story was not read as a factual report of events. In the early fifth century, Saint Augustine, the founding theologian of Western Christianity, devoted 15 years to composing The Literal Meaning of Genesis, in which he argued that the biblical text need not be understood literally if it goes against what we know to be true from other sources. More radically, the first-century Greek-speaking Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria presented Genesis as an allegory: an interweaving of symbolic imagery with imagined events that contained a body of meaning that could not easily be expressed in other ways.<br />Throughout much of its long life, the story of Adam and Eve was understood to be a myth - and myths can have many meanings. Third- and fourth-century Gnostic texts discovered in 1945 near Nag Hammadi in Egypt portray Eve - later condemned for staining all humankind with original sin - as the hero of the story, wiser and more courageous than Adam, while showing the serpent as a liberator offering the first humans freedom from the rule of a jealous God.<br />In a fascinating appendix, Greenblatt goes on to cite some of the \""vast archive\"" of interpretations that the story has evoked. Clement of Alexandria (circa 150-215) wrote of Adam\'s and Eve\'s \""happy blindness - happy, of course, because they did not know that they could not see\"" - and suggested it was this that explained their transgression, \""since it must have been difficult for them to distinguish the forbidden fruit from all others\"". According to Martin Luther (1483-1546), on the other hand, when offered the fruit by Eve, \""Adam immediately took it and ate. Why? He could scarcely have put it into words, but if compelled, he might have said: an eternity in this condition is unendurable. I hate the contemplation of the One who made me. I hate the overwhelming debt of gratitude. I hate God.\""<br />What is most striking about the story is its capacity to express contradictory attitudes to the experience of being human. This is not because those who have told and retold it have been confused. The story expresses universal conflicts within human beings, rendered into a vernacular language of monotheism. The power of this inexhaustible myth comes from it not having any univocal meaning. Yet in recent times the Genesis story has come to be regarded as an erroneous theory of human origins invented before humanity received the modern scientific revelation. Reviving a simple-minded 19th-century philosophy, contemporary campaigners against religion dismiss the Genesis story along with all other myths as rudimentary exercises in scientific theorising.<br />Identifying myths with superseded theories was the core of James George Frazer\'s The Golden Bough: a study in comparative religion, first published in 1890, in which the late-Victorian Scottish anthropologist located mythic thinking in the infancy of the human species. Frazer drew heavily on the work of the French positivist philosopher Auguste Comte (1798-1857), who believed that human thought went through three phases: religious, metaphysical and scientific. Belonging in the first of these stages, the story of Adam and Eve was a hypothesis that could be discarded now that the truth had been discovered by Darwin. In this view, which seems self-evident to the \""new atheists\"" who are currently peddling a reheated version of it, religion is only a primitive sort of science. Yet the positivist notion that myths are primitive forms of thought is itself extremely primitive. As Wittgenstein put it in a lecture on religion, \""Frazer is much more savage than most of his savages... His explanations of primitive observances are much cruder than the meaning of the observances themselves.\""<br />Frazer\'s view of \""primitive\"" societies can now be seen as a relic of Victorian rationalism, which legitimated the colonial structures of the time in terms of an ersatz-Darwinian theory of cultural evolution. By representing the contingencies of power as stages in an imaginary process of human development, Frazer became a myth-maker. <br />In his chapter on Darwin, Greenblatt observes that the role of chance in natural selection left the theory of evolution \""resistant to narrative coherence\"", producing \""repeated attempts to impose a satisfying plot of one kind or another on Darwinism\"". Evolutionist defences of imperialism and racism were among these attempts. Yet the renewal of myth in rationalist philosophies goes back further, appearing in some of the central figures of the Enlightenment.<br />The Christian insistence on the factual truth of the Genesis story left the myth vulnerable to new discoveries. The expanded vision of the globe and of the variety of its human inhabitants that came with the discovery of the New World threatened the belief that all of humankind originated in just two parents. At the same time, the Genesis story was undermined by the recovery of lost texts such as the Roman poet Lucretius\'s On the Nature of Things - whose re-discovery was the subject of Greenblatt\'s book The Swerve: How the World Became Modern (2011) - in which the cosmos is pictured as everlasting and species emerge as a result of random shifts in matter. As Greenblatt shows, one of the boldest responses to these new challenges came from Isaac La Peyrère, a theologian born in Bordeaux in 1596 and brought up in a Calvinist family. <br />In 1655, La Peyrère published Prae-Adamitae, translated into English as Men Before Adam, in which he argued that when God created Adam and Eve, the world was already full of human beings. Adam was not the father of all humankind but only of the Jewish people, who had been chosen by God to receive the divine law and, through Jesus, to bring all humankind redemption. As an interpretation of Genesis, this could hardly have been more provocative; the book was burned and its author arrested for heresy. After a long interrogation and an interview with the pope, La Peyrère recanted, converted to Catholicism and passed the rest of his life in retirement.<br />In the work of La Peyrère, what came to be known as pre-Adamism was an expression of freedom of thought. His family had been Marranos - Portuguese Jews who were forced to convert to Christianity, many of them leaving Portugal for other parts of Europe or the Americas to escape continuing persecution by the Inquisition. La Peyrère used pre-Adamism to argue for tolerance and did not rank different types of humans in any hierarchy. <br />Later, pre-Adamite theory was used for different purposes. As Greenblatt indicates, La Peyrère\'s account of multiple human origins was revived in the late 18th and 19th centuries by racists, who invoked it to promote ideologies of racial inequality.<br />At this point, there is a missing link in Greenblatt\'s history of ideas. He fails to note how pre-Adamism was taken up by some of the key thinkers of the Enlightenment to become one of the inspirations of modern racism. Chief among them was Voltaire, whose Philosophical Dictionary (1764) Greenblatt discusses at some length. The Dictionary abounds in slighting references to Jews - the entry on Abraham describes them as \""a small, new, ignorant, crude people\"" - not cited by Greenblatt. <br />It is Voltaire\'s use of pre-Adamite theory that is more interesting, however. He ridiculed the Genesis myth, which in classic rationalist fashion he dismissed as a defective theory of human origins. Instead, he advocated a version of La Peyrère\'s polygenetic theory, in which only Jews are Adamites and the rest of humankind belong in several distinct groups. <br />Unlike La Peyrère, Voltaire viewed these groups as inherently unequal. He believed that Europe owed its civilisation not to the Hebrew descendants of Adam, whom he regarded as thoroughly barbaric, but principally to the Greeks and the Romans. Any prospect of progress in civilisation required that the influence of Adamites - exercised through Judaism and Christianity - be curbed and ultimately eliminated.<br />Not all pre-Adamites could be civilised, however. Some were essentially brutish. In a letter to a correspondent, Voltaire asked whether Africans were descended from monkeys, or monkeys from Africans. Detaching pre-Adamism from theology and identifying it with ideas of racial hierarchy, Voltaire was a pivotal figure in the emergence of modern Western racism. Writers such as the American physician, ethnographer and \""craniologist\"" Samuel George Morton (1799-1851) - who argued that there were several species of humans with differently sized skulls and correspondingly different levels of intellectual ability, with Africans being the least intelligent - followed a path that Voltaire had opened up.<br />The claim to be based in science is one of the defining features of modern myths. After the collapse of European imperial power, the pseudo-Darwinian mythology that propped up colonialism fell into disrepute. But it was soon followed by other myths claiming a basis in social science. A progressive mythology developed that viewed racism and imperialism as exclusively Western vices and the flaws and conflicts of post-colonial states entirely as consequences of colonial rule. These myths were channelled through theories of modernisation, which posited a future fundamentally different from anything that existed in the past.<br />Like the story of Adam and Eve in Christian orthodoxy, modern myths claim to be objective truths. If we read the story as it was read in subtler times by scholars such as Philo, however, it teaches us that human beings become myth-makers when the increase of knowledge threatens to thwart their need for meaning. If science reveals a world without any overarching purpose or direction - as Darwin\'s theory of natural selection does - science is distorted to promote a vision of evolution that satisfies the demand for narrative coherence. <br />This is what happened when Darwinism was appropriated by racists, and later by humanists such as Julian Huxley who reinterpreted the aimless process of evolution as the spiralling advance of intelligence in the cosmos.<br />With their babble about a godlike humanity taking charge of its future evolution, today\'s campaigners against religion do much the same. Since living without myths is unendurable, these rationalists cover themselves with fig leaves of cod-science, close their eyes and return to a state of happy blindness.

f3055628c1,"St. Mary\'s surgeon sues CNN, Jupiter Farms \'heart mom\' - MyPalmBeachPost","St. Mary\'s surgeon sues CNN, Jupiter Farms \'heart mom\'<br />The doctor at the center of a CNN story that eventually led to the closure of the pediatric cardiac surgery program at St. Mary\'s Medical Center struck back Tuesday with a remarkable defamation lawsuit against the cable news network.Dr. Michael Black\'s meticulous 208-page lawsuit [1]filed in Palm Beach County Circuit Court claims CNN - with wanton malice and reckless disregard for the truth - miscalculated the mortality rate for St. Mary\'s fledgling program, reporting that it was three times the national average. Black\'s lawsuit called the death rate calculation by CNN \""a fundamentally flawed pseudo-statistical analysis.\""The preconceived goal of CNN\'s article and video report, according to the lawsuit, \""was to manufacture an outrageous, headline-grabbing story about an incompetent, dishonest and inexperienced doctor leading a surgical program in crisis and recklessly operating on young children to profit at the expense of those children\'s lives.\""The CNN report sent St. Mary\'s reeling and was the death knell for the pediatric cardiac program in August when the hospital\'s CEO, Davide Carbone, also resigned. Black and the hospital have been named in malpractice lawsuits filed by parents of babies featured in the CNN video and article on its website[2].Nine babies died following heart surgery during the program\'s brief existence, starting in 2011. But the suit claims that CNN knew - and was told repeatedly by St. Mary\'s and others ahead of broadcast - that its calculated mortality rate was wrong and that the hospital\'s real rate was in line with the national average.The lawsuit is replete with screen grabs from the video portion of CNN\'s June 1 story titled \""Secret Deaths: CNN Finds High Surgical Death Rate for Children at a Florida Hospital.\"" The complaint also provides numerous examples of the social media blitz that accompanied CNN\'s investigative piece.Black, who is still on staff at St. Mary\'s, did not specify a dollar amount to be sought at trial except to say he seeks compensation for \""reputational and economic harm.\""Lead reporter Elizabeth Cohen, as well as on-air talent and renowned anchor Anderson Cooper, are among six defendants in the 24-count defamation complaint, including a Jupiter Farms \""heart mom\"" who played a big role in Cohen\'s reporting and was the subject of at least two police complaints. Cooper featured the story on the air and on his show\'s Facebook page.CNN: \'We intend to fight this\'CNN responded to the suit in a statement: \""We intend to fight this in the courts. We will fight hard in defense of our reporting and we expect to prevail.\""Cohen did not respond to an e-mail request for comment. Other defendants in the lawsuit included producer John Bonifield and CNN employee Dana Ford who helped report the story on the program\'s closure.The news network - in what the lawsuit alleges was a ratings grab with a story about babies with broken hearts - ignored Black\'s prestigious background and the many successful operations he performed to focus on a handful of cases. Black is fighting at least two lawsuits filed by parents of infants who were operated on by the doctor and featured in CNN\'s story.The lawsuit claims CNN\'s story on St. Mary\'s program and its many followups - reported on by The Palm Beach Post[3],[4] USA Today and numerous other news outlets - has effectively ended Dr. Black\'s career and even subjected him to death threats. In one example, a caller said Black would end up \""butchered just like (his) patients.\""The lawsuit repeatedly references the network\'s use of the phrase \""babies as sacrificial lambs.\""The complaint claims Cohen and CNN ignored information from St. Mary\'s and its parent Tenet Hospitals.For instance, CNN claims that Black could receive up to $500,000 per surgery even though it had acknowledged in an email to the hospital that program\'s two-year budget was $876,000 and knew Black was a salaried employee. Many of families portrayed were \""extremely poor,\"" the lawsuit noted.Reporter promoting \'brand\'\""Dr. Black\'s complaint clearly demonstrates the lengths to which CNN and its reporters are willing to go to grab headlines and promote their \'Empowered Patient\' brand,\"" said Libby Locke, one of Black\'s attorneys out of Alexandria, Va., who filed the suit.\""CNN recklessly - and repeatedly - ignored information demonstrating the absolute falsity of their claims about Dr. Black and the surgical program he led, and deliberately manipulated statistics to fit their predetermined conclusion about the quality of care provided by Dr. Black and St. Mary\'s.\""The lawsuit portrays the cutthroat response St. Mary\'s and Black faced in starting a pediatric cardiac surgery program in Palm Beach County from competitors Nicklaus Children\'s Hospital in Miami and Joe DiMaggio Children\'s Hospital in Hollywood. Black around 2011 received a call from Dr. Redmond Burke, the founder of the Congenital Heart Institute at Nicklaus, telling him to \""Go back to California!\"" and \""You think you know competition in California; you haven\'t seen anything yet!\"" the lawsuit stated.St. Mary\'s program was essentially blackballed when many established cardiology practices refused to refer patients to Black and St. Mary\'s. As a result, the program received primarily the most delicate and \""undesirable\"" patients. \""Dr. Black, however, never turned down a patient needing care,\"" his lawsuit states.Jupiter Farms \'heart mom\'Burke - though he nor Nicklaus are named as defendants in Black\'s lawsuit - plays a pivotal role in the CNN story because he is tied to Kelly Robinson of Jupiter Farms. Robinson became an advocate \""heart mom\"" when the Nicklaus surgeon operated on her son. The Post in July reported[5] on Robinson\'s role in the CNN stories and Black\'s complaint further elaborates.The lawsuits states Robinson contacted patients and nurses, telling them that Black \""kills babies\"" and leaves them \""butchered\"" and \""mangled.\"" She also held herself out to be a CNN employee and the lawsuit confirms that Robinson was the stranger who appears in the lead of CNN\'s print story, warning a couple in the elevator to have their heart-sick infant transferred from St. Mary\'s.The lawsuit reiterates details from The Post story in which Robinson fraudulently obtained a visitor\'s pass on April 5 and was escorted by security out of the hospital screaming, \""Dr. Black is a baby-killing wacko!\"" and \""better be watching CNN next week.\""Robinson allegedly threatened nursing staff that if they didn\'t cooperate with CNN\'s Cohen they would be shamed by CNN. And she even went to a home of a patient of Black\'s prior to surgery.CNN told the Post last year that Robinson was not employed by the cable news network, but Black\'s lawsuit claims Robinson was \""a key liaison,\"" setting up interviews with family members for Cohen.\""Robinson was motivated to defame and disparage Dr. Black in an effort to harm him and the St. Mary\'s program and to direct more patients to and support the pediatric cardiac surgery program at Nicklaus (Miami) Children\'s Hospital, and, specifically, to her child\'s surgeon and her personal friend, Dr. Redmond Burke,\"" the lawsuit states.Phone calls to Robinson and Nicklaus Children\'s Hospital for comment were not returned.As reported by The Post in several stories last summer, the data used in CNN\'s report was widely disputed by the hospital and the state\'s Agency for Health Care Administration. The lawsuit alleges Cohen purposefully ignored data that includes the risk level for each surgery, which levels the playing field for hospitals who care for the sickest children.[6]Apples-oranges dataBlack\'s complaint also alleges Cohen compared mortality data of open-heart surgeries garnered at St. Mary\'s with national data of open-heart and closed-heart surgeries compiled by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons.Tenet warned CNN repeatedly of using such data, saying in an email to the network that it had \""divided an apple by an orange and compared it to a banana.\""St. Mary\'s declined specific comment, but noted that it has rolled out updated data[7] that shows the mortality rate was 4.9 percent - not the 12.5 percent rate reported by CNN.The lawsuit goes into Cohen\'s background, alleging she has set herself up as an advocate, writing a book called \""The Empowered Patient\"" and penning a column for CNN with the same name. The lawsuit claims the reporter has written about her beliefs that hospitals are \""truly dangerous\"" places and that \""physicians play favorites.\""Cohen in 2013 did a similar story [8]that ended up closing the pediatric cardiac surgery program at Kentucky Children\'s Hospital in Lexington. The lawsuit said CNN portrayed St. Mary\'s as obstructionist and refusing answer questions when the network knew that the hospital was prohibited by federal law from commenting on a patient\'s case without a waiver.One of the chief cases CNN used in its story involved an infant who was left paralyzed after the surgery. Black\'s lawsuit points out that paralysis is a well-known risk of a coarctectomy even when performed well and that CNN failed to say other doctors reviewed the work and found Black performed up to standards.References^ meticulous 208-page lawsuit (assets.documentcloud.org)^ article on its website (www.cnn.com)^ reported on by The Palm Beach Post (palmbeachhealthbeat.blog.palmbeachpost.com)^ , (palmbeachhealthbeat.blog.palmbeachpost.com)^ The Post in July reported (www.mypalmbeachpost.com)^ in several stories last summer (palmbeachhealthbeat.blog.palmbeachpost.com)^ out updated data (www.stmarysmc.com)^ in 2013 did a similar story (www.cnn.com)<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHrFyC3sNA8RbVdtlfgEFa8-Ge8jg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779048454625&ei=cSrEVovwO4iwaeKAuKgM&url=http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/st-marys-surgeon-sues-cnn-jupiter-farms-heart-mom/nqRFR/,EN,,17/02/2016 08:08,2016-02-16 21:33:00+00:00,8742bf891f,MyPalmBeachPost,,,,,1455661980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f2f54db154,Why We\'re So Divided Over Saving Wolves - National Geographic - National Geographic,"Why We\'re So Divided Over Saving Wolves<br />Until recently, very few people had ever seen a wolf in the wild. But thanks to the success of the recovery program in Yellowstone National Park[1], more and more people are getting the chance to appreciate this iconic animal. But for many ranchers, wolves-like coyotes-are regarded as varmint to be eradicated. For hunters and trappers, they are exciting quarry.<br />In Wolf Nation: The Life, Death, and Return of Wild American Wolves[2], Brenda Peterson[3] takes us inside the world of these top predators-and the cultural war being waged over them. Speaking from her home in Seattle, she explains why the battle over wolves is like the abortion debate, how removing protections in six Western states has led to the deaths of more than 3,000 wolves, and why so many wolf advocates are women.<br />Photograph courtesy of Da Capo Press <br />You are today a passionate advocate for wolves. Yet you were born on the other side of the tracks, so to speak, into a family of hunters and wildlife managers. How did you make the transition-and how does your early experience inform your work?<br />Wonderful question! I was raised in the enemy camp, so to speak, in the Plumas National Forest, in the high Sierra, northern California, by hunters and wildlife managers. But many hunters do not believe in killing wolves; they believe in sustainable hunting and fair chase ethics. I was raised with some of these hunters, who told me, \""There is the big good wolf.\"" I think this gave me a certain authenticity when it comes to talking about wildlife and endangered species. Because I come from within the culture that once eradicated them, I can speak to hunters and ranchers-and search for common ground.<br />You write, \""wolf preservation has often been called \'the abortion issue of wildlife\'.\'\' Why are the sides so polarized?<br />You\'re dealing with a fault line between cultures and, as we know from earthquake studies, fault lines are very volatile and active. On either side, you have people who have a sense of righteousness about their cause. One side, the hunters and ranchers, has been dominant since we began as a country. Now, all of a sudden, you have voices coming from the public, who are often urban and have an environmental passion.<br />There is a passion that goes deeper than politics. It goes to the sense of, I am in this culture. I belong to the anti-wolf culture, or the pro-wolf culture. And they don\'t speak to one another, just like in the abortion issue, where you have people who have a strong, religious pro-life stance and others who are pro-choice. One of the ways to change that is to have a conversation.<br />You claim that USDA killed at least 3.2 million wild animals in 2015, including hundreds of bears, wolves, mountain lions, and bobcats. Can you explain these shocking figures to our readers-and where wolves fit into those stats?[4]<br />This is Wildlife Services[5], which the New York Times accused of operating in the shadows of government. They\'re the ones who are called in to cull a wolf pack accused of depredation, and they have no limits. Wildlife Services is a SWAT team against wildlife. Because they operate in secret, and it\'s hard to find out statistics, they\'ve done what they want to do. It\'s only now that they\'re coming out of the shadows and being held accountable.<br />Photographing the Wild Wolves of Yellowstone<br />Hear photographer Ronan Donovan describe the challenge of photographing one of Yellowstone National Park\'s most elusive and iconic species.<br />How many of that 3.2 million is wolves?<br />Of the 3.2 million native wildlife killed by USDA/WS in 2015, according to the data from their own report, 415 of those animals were gray wolves[6]. However, USDA/WS is not the only threat to wolves. In 2011, federal protections for wolves were lifted in six states-Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The Center for Biological Diversity estimates that, since 2011, in these six states, more than 3,762 wolves have been killed by private citizens during state-sanctioned hunting and trapping seasons.<br />President Trump and the Republicans want to dial back the Endangered Species Act and take federal lands out of public hands. How will this affect wolf populations? [7]<br />This is a disaster for wildlife, all wildlife. This is a president who doesn\'t have any experience of nature. He\'s a city boy; his sons\' relationship to nature is big game hunting[8]. And you have a congress that is invested in gutting the Endangered Species Act.<br />We made great progress with the reintroduction in the 90s but this is a real regression; and it\'s a scary time for all wildlife, especially wolves. I was interviewing a woman last week from Defenders of Wildlife, and she was distraught. She said that in Wyoming, which has just lifted protections for wolves, a man called her to brag that he had gotten on his snowmobile, chased a wild wolf for 30 miles, until the wolf collapsed from exhaustion, and then he shot her.<br />I was surprised to learn that wolves now have lawyers. Tell us about this great lady Amaroq Weiss-and why so many women are involved in wolf advocacy.<br />I found that really interesting. I\'ve spent a lot of time with whales and dolphins, which are my other wildlife passion, and most of those people are men. They are now discovering that wolf packs are matrilineal. And women like Amaroq Weiss are on the forefront of conversations about wolves. I asked Amaroq, \""Why do you think so many women go into wolf recovery and research?\"" She said, \""It takes a pack, and women are really good at cooperating.\""<br />In Idaho, ranchers and conservationists have worked together to protect both sheep and wolves.<br />Photograph by Matt Moyer, National Geographic Creative <br />Amaroq lives in San Francisco with her husband and is the West Coast wolf advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity[9]. Because she understands the rural mind set, she also works with ranchers and wolf advocates teaching them how to give testimony on behalf of the wild wolf. She says, \""My client is the wild wolf.\"" It\'s pretty cool.<br />You write, \""Some wolves, like humans, are legends.\"" Tell us the amazing story of the wolf known as 06 (or 832F)-and why she caught the nation\'s attention.[10]<br />06 was the world\'s most famous wolf. She was born in 2006, which is why she has the name \""06.\"" Her story, like many of the Yellowstone wolves[11], is legend. She was very independent. When she disbursed from her pack, which was starving, people thought she would die too, because only 20 percent of wolves are ever alone. They\'re usually looking for new packs or love. But 06 spent a year on her own, which took a lot of guts and courage to survive the winter!<br />When she finally found her mates, they were two brothers who were young and kind of clueless. But she made a decision that two might be better than one mate. Over time, she taught them to hunt, and they had many pups together. She was often seen hunting even when she was pregnant or nursing. Eventually, the two brothers caught on and became really good hunters in their own right.<br />If you got to see 06, you never forgot her because she was so beautiful, handsome and powerful. She could take an elk down alone. A 700-pound elk? That\'s extraordinary!<br />Did she die a natural death?<br />Tragically, no. And this is why everyone\'s very worried now that there\'s going to be hunting again. Wolves don\'t understand that they\'re in a \""park.\"" But if they put a foot over a boundary, they are suddenly open game for wolf hunters. Because 06 had a big family to feed, she and her family sometimes ventured outside of Yellowstone Park. The first time, one of the brothers was shot dead. They all scurried back to the safety of the park. But when they went outside the park again, a hunter shot 06[12]. It was \""a shot heard around the world,\"" like the one that killed John Lennon.<br />A study by the University of Cambridge, England, looked into the howling repertoires, or \""vocal fingerprints,\"" of wolves. What did they find out?[13]<br />Scientists call the howling among wolves social glue. It is like people around a campfire singing together. It builds social connection, intimacy, and loyalty. Having heard many wolves howl in the wild, I believe they sometimes just sing to make music, like us.<br />The scientists at Cambridge even found that wolves had 21 different dialects. Through the sonograms and wave patterns of wolf howls, they found that, like whales and birds, wolves were controlling their singing and subject to cultural influences. A huge discovery!<br />I begin every talk that I give with a group howl. I play the howl of wild wolves, then I ask everyone, how many of you have ever heard a wolf howling in the wild? It used to be, there\'d only be one person, usually a wolf researcher. Now because of Yellowstone and Denali[14], there\'ll be perhaps 10. Then I say, \""Every one of you and every one of your grandchildren-this is your birthright, to hear a wolf howling in the wild.\""<br />A rare example of wolf advocates and ranchers working together is occurring in Idaho. Tell us about the Wood River Wolf Project-and why it could be a model for nationwide coexistence?[15]<br />I\'m so glad you asked about that because with all the sad stories about wolves, there are some that are really positive. Idaho, where the project operates, is one of the most anti-wolf states. Yet, in the middle of this virulent, anti-wolf zeitgeist, ranchers are working with conservationists to protect the sheep along what is known as the Super Sheep Highway.<br />Every spring, from May until October, they move 10,000-25,000 sheep along this highway. And in the last nine years, not one wolf has been killed and they\'ve only lost 30 sheep! This shows that ranchers, livestock, and wolves can get together. The main focus is not killing wolves but prevention. They use red plastic flags that flap on fences and frighten wolves, livestock guardian dogs, usually Great Pyrenees[16], or range riders, like in the Old West. This is the key to the future.<br />How many livestock do wolves actually kill each year?<br />The idea that wolves kill vast numbers of livestock is a myth propagated by the livestock industry. Wolves are responsible for approximately 0.2 percent of cattle and calf deaths, and slightly more for sheep and lamb deaths. The biggest source of deaths is not wolves or any other predators. It is respiratory and digestive problems, disease, weather, and birthing complications.<br />At the end of the book, you quote Doug Smith, the project leader in Yellowstone, who says: \""Wolves are back because people wanted it.\"" Explain how public opinion is helping shape the future for wolves-and how our readers can add their voices, or even howls, to the debate?[17]<br />[Laughs] Wildlife management has been the purview of ranchers, hunters, and the government, which has been beholden to the interests of the livestock industry, since the beginning of our country. But now, because so many people have seen wolves, they want to step up and have a voice in wildlife agencies.<br />One of the best things you can do is volunteer to take part in the wildlife agencies. They used to be only appointed by the governor but now anyone can apply. I would also join a grass roots organization, like the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, or the Natural Resources Defense Council.<br />I say to kids, adopt an animal and spend your life learning, understanding, and protecting that animal, because as Jacques Cousteau said, \""People protect what they love.\"" One of my favorite organizations is Kids4Wolves[18], founded by a girl called Story Warren[19]. It is completely devoted to the Yellowstone wolves. Right now, the Trump administration is regressing. But I don\'t think they\'ll be in forever. So I think there is hope.

I switched to light duty, manning the animal emergency hotline, but my hands locked up trying to type or hold a pen.\'A doctor gave her a preliminary diagnosis of Lyme disease, which was most likely contracted from a deer tick bite at the rescue centre. But her test results came back negative - as many people who do in fact have the disease have experienced as the test is not always accurate.Her antibiotics were stopped and she was instead referred to a rheumatologist.\'I knew in my gut that wasn\'t the cause for my weakening, painful joints and muscles,\' she added. I was determined to carry on - thanks to RockyWith no firm diagnosis or treatment, Ms Venzel was left to battle on with her symptoms. However, she was determined to finish her six-month internship in whatever way possible.And she found herself making a habit out of visiting Rocky every day on the 250-acre property.\'Of the thousand animals in my care, Rocky stole my heart the minute I laid eyes on him,\' she explains.  <br />Ms Venzel pictured at a conservation center in Florida with a disabled turtle named Montel WHAT IS LYME DISEASE?   Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks.The most common symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, fatigue and a skin rash called erythema migrans.The disease can typically be treated by several weeks of oral antibiotics.But if left untreated, the infection can spread to the joints, heart and nervous symptoms and be deadly.  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE INFECTED?During the first three to 30 days of infection, these symptoms may occur:FeverChillsHeadacheFatigueMuscle and joint achesSwollen lymph nodesErythema migrans (EM) rash The rash occurs in approximately 80 percent of infected people.It can expand to up to 12 inches (30 cm), eventually clearing and giving off the appearance of a target or a \'bull\'s-eye\'.Later symptoms of Lyme disease include:Severe headaches and neck stiffnessAdditional EM rashesArthritis with joint pain and swellingFacial or Bell\'s PlasyHeart palpitationsProblems with short-term memoryNerve pain Source: CDC \'He taught himself to walk by balancing on his back legs, using them much like a pirate would a peg leg. \'Animals have a way of maintaining their zest for life no matter what hand they\'re dealt. \'Rocky didn\'t seem to notice his back legs weren\'t made for walking.\'He never accomplished anything quickly.\'But he always accomplished whatever he set his mind to. Every morning and afternoon, that included walking over to the fence to see me. \'And so I fought through the fatigue, charley horses [muscle spasms], and fiery joint pain to complete my commitment.\' Lyme will never stop me following my dreams After her stint at the centre, Ms Venzelfor further diagnostics, when it was eventually confirmed she had Lyme.In the months following her diagnosis, she struggled with every day tasks such as putting her hair in a ponytail and cutting up her food - but continued to live her life. Spotted quickly, the disease is halted with antibiotics. But if left untreated, its impact can be devastating - in 25 per cent of cases, the nervous system is affected, causing numbness and memory problems.\'My body screamed to just collapse into a bed and sleep for weeks, but I had dreams to nurture and a paraplegic sheep to honor,\' she said. Despite her health battles, the actress and author has volunteered at a sea turtle conservation center in Florida.Again, she found herself bonding with another damaged creature, a non-releasable turtle named Montel.But she says she will never forget Rocky - and one day she aspires to open her own sanctuary for disabled animals and offer therapy for disabled people.\'Rocky passed away peacefully a couple years after I left, news I received in a text message from a co-worker who knew how much this sheep meant to me.\'Some days I still find myself struggling to open jars, chronic joint pain still a daily hurdle.\'I have had to adapt my lifestyle in a hundred ways since being diagnosed six years ago, but thanks to Rocky, it has never stopped me from following my dreams.\'References^ Wide Open Pets (www.wideopenpets.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEGoLSm-V-iNAqnVIIeBAGC4SglQw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=Dj54WeiGKobfzAbl1pPQAQ&url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4725762/Woman-says-paraplegic-SHEEP-helped-battle-Lyme-disease.html,EN,,26/07/2017 07:00,2017-07-25 13:38:31+00:00,2149121cdb,Daily Mail,,,,,1500997111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0e4b225c83,Lollying Around: Why Does My Horse Play With His Tongue? - TheHorse.com,"Why Does My Horse Play With His Tongue? - The Horse<br />Q. My 4-year-old gelding plays with his tongue every night in his stall at feeding time when he\'s waiting on his hay (see video below or at http://bit.ly/2tMXPrc). Why would a horse do this? Is it because new teeth are growing in, or is he just bored? - Jennifer, via email<br />A. Great video clip! This behavior goes by a few names, but lollying is probably the most common. I couldn\'t appreciate if there was any sucking, as well. There are actually many variations of tongue and lip movements in various combinations and specific forms. All are pretty peculiar and very interesting. As far as I know, no one knows for sure why some horses do it.<br />These oral behaviors appear to be more common among orphan foals, particularly bucket-fed foals. Also, oral behaviors often develop soon after weaning in early weaned foals. So one theory is that the behavior may fill the need for sucking. These tongue behaviors, like cribbing, may also increase salivation, which can help buffer stomach acids.<br />Many early weaned foals and orphan foals have gastric ulcers. It is quite common for adult horses with cribbing and other aberrant oral behaviors to have gastric ulcers, as well. When the gastric ulcers are treated and eliminated, the abnormal behavior often subsides. It usually doesn\'t go away altogether but, rather, decreases. In your horse\'s case, because the behavior occurs when he is waiting for his hay, it may, like cribbing, serve to increase saliva to buffer the stomach acids that are flowing in anticipation of feeding. So I would recommend having your veterinarian perform gastroscopy and treat him for gastric ulcers, if necessary. I have not heard of these unusual oral behaviors associated with teeth coming in.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEDvGiIsfAWOJ-km6j8wTkFEoHuUQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=bK00W6iqM4yh-wbZ1oWoAw&url=https://thehorse.com/136699/lollying-around-why-does-my-horse-play-with-his-tongue/,EN,,28/06/2018 09:40,2017-10-05 15:59:45+00:00,bb82b4c124,TheHorse.com,,,,,1507226385,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f35812d572,Burris shares 100 years of travel and life experience - State Gazette,"Burris shares 100 years of travel and life experience (02/28/16)<br />John Burris, 100, stands in front of pictures of his family, including his wife of 55 years, Hope Ainley Burris, and their two children, Melodee and Carolyn.<br />RACHEL TOWNSEND<br />rtownsend@stategazette.com[1]<br />Local resident John Burris has not always called the city of Dyersburg home. Throughout his 100 years, Burris has lived an extraordinary life, filled with many fond adventures and captivating moments. Inspiring countless individuals through his account of life, Burris\' intriguing tales have been told at various locations across the nation.<br />Born in 1915, Burris was raised in rural Missouri and attended school until the eighth grade. <br />\""I was raised in a log cabin in the most primitive area of Missouri that you could imagine,\"" said Burris. \""I didn\'t go to high school until I was about 40 years old.\""<br />In 1932, in the middle of the Great Depression, an ambitious 17-year-old Burris traveled out west, to California, to find his place in the world, carrying with him no more than the hope of a life more promising. <br />California, the Golden State, founded by the many who had traveled west looking for a future from within the state\'s gold mines and creek beds, had, at that time, become overrun with farming families and those fleeing from the Dust Bowl with hopes of finding a better life.<br />Upon traveling to California, Burris had originally hoped to find employment by picking fruit in the ripe fields that had been so popularly advertised throughout the west during that time. <br />\""It was difficult because 30 percent of the population weren\'t employed then, but I thought I could make it. You know, when you\'re young, you just don\'t have any sense at all. There was plenty of work in California, picking fruit, but there were also a lot of other people there doing it.\""<br />Recently, John Burris made his way downtown to the cast his vote for president. <br />\'I cast my vote for Marco Rubio. The rest of those politicians are windbags. I don\'t like Trump. He is a windbag. There are people in the world, when you\'re young, that you just don\'t want anything to do with because they\'re trouble. I\'ve never wanted to be in any trouble so I stay away from those people, and that Donald Trump, he\'s someone I wouldn\'t associate with, cause he is such a windbag,\' said Burris.<br />Because of the large influx of citizens arriving from across the nation, Burris was initially unable to secure steady work in California. It was too late for him to turn back, but he had not yet abandoned the hope of finding the life that he sought.<br />\""I decided I would try to work for a log company, so I headed up into the mountains. It was a nice little area, a lumber town, in Calpine, California. That\'s where I got my very first job. I was making 40 cents an hour,\"" said Burris. <br />\""I was there for a few years and then I went up to Modoc County, and lived in a tiny community called Tionesta. I got a fuel job, and was making $1.04 an hour, while common laborers were only getting 55 cents an hour. I thought I was smart; I really wasn\'t, but I had the idea at that time. After doing that awhile, my instincts told me that I didn\'t want to be doing that for the rest of my life.\""<br />After leaving the small community of Tionesta, Burris found a job building airplanes such as the B-24 Bomber and PBY Catalina.<br />During Burris\' mid-20s, the United States entered into World War II, and young men, like Burris, found themselves answering the call to service. Burris enlisted to serve a four-year term as a U.S. Marine.<br />Shaking his head at the thoughts brought on by his time spent in service, Burris said, \""I spent about three years in the Pacific, and I\'ve been trying for 70 years to forget it. War is terrible. ... After being out in the Pacific, they sent us back to states, and they asked us which coast we wanted to be transferred to. <br />\""I had never been on the East Coast before, so I told them to send me there, and they did. I went to Camp Lejeune, in North Carolina. I had it good there. It was 100,000 acres. I had a job that took me around everywhere. ... I had a M1903 Springfield rifle that I fired at the range with. We didn\'t have the new rifles, we were behind. ... Then the war ended, Harry Truman dropped the bomb on Japan and they surrendered. <br />\""I never ended up having to go (invade Japan), we were all ready to go, but we never had too. The invasion would have taken hundreds of thousands of lives. I was sure that when it was my turn to go, I would never be coming back. It would have been my last trip, so it\'s a miracle that I never ended up going. It was a miracle that saved me.\""<br />After the war, Burris returned to Ventura, California, located roughly 100 miles from the bustling Los Angeles city scene. While living in Ventura, Burris was able to finish his high school education, and began taking nighttime classes at the local college.<br />\""I spent a lot of time going to school,\"" said Burris. \""I picked up a lot of things.\""<br />Burris was also able to gain employment through the state as a weights and measures worker, a job he continued to hold until in his late 30s, at which time, he married his wife, Hope Ainley Burris, a teacher and native resident of Woodlake, California.<br />\""Marrying my wife was the most memorable thing that I have ever done in my life. I was visiting a cousin of mine in Woodlake, and Hope pulled up to get some mail out of the mailbox. Her family lived a little over a mile away from my cousin. <br />\""She had beautiful black hair. I can still remember all of the good times that we had together. It was amazing. I can\'t believe someone like me could ever have found an angel like that,\"" smiled Burris. \""I put on quite an effort to win that girl. It was the romance of my life.\""<br />Burris and Hope had two children during their 55-year marriage, Melodee and Carolyn. Together the couple worked together to found the Burris Educational Trust. During their marriage, the couple traveled across both the nation and the globe, visiting countries such as Scotland, Ireland, and Tahiti. <br />\""I have seven grandchildren. I paid for each of their college tuitions. I gave away almost half a million dollars to my children and grandchildren. I feel like that\'s the only real thing that I have done in my life,\"" said Burris. <br />After the birth of Melodee, the couple relocated to Hope\'s hometown of Woodlake for a short period of time. The family later traveled back east to Missouri, where Burris began a cattle ranch, and Hope gave birth to the couple\'s youngest daughter, Carolyn.<br />\""I had a good job doing weights and measurements. I got to travel all over, but I was still young enough that I felt like I just had to try something different, so I got a cattle ranch. I was running about 600-700 steers a year. I have no clue why I decided to do that, but I guess I just needed a challenge,\"" laughed Burris. <br />\""I needed to try things. My instinct is sometimes better than my judgment, and after 12 years of running the cattle ranch, I decided it was time to move again. I was getting along good in Missouri, I was a part of the state\'s Cattlemen\'s Association and everything. I had an important part in the church, and had even ran for a public office once -- what a miserable mistake that was.\""<br />After moving back to California, the family settled, once again, in Woodlake. It was here, on 17 acres of land that Hope had inherited, that Burris began to build his wife the home that she had always wanted. <br />\""I liked living in Ventura. It was the nicest place to live that you could possibly imagine. It\'s right there on the coast. You could go out every morning, in the ocean, and swim. The people were friendly, and I knew just about everyone there. I was a member of the Masonic Lodge, but Woodlake was nice too,\"" said Burris.<br />While in his 70s, Burris contracted an advanced case of Valley Fever, a fungal infection caused by coccidioides organisms causing fever and coughing. <br />\""I couldn\'t get over it. It gets in your lungs and in your bloodstream. I went to a doctor to find out what it was, but the doctor said he couldn\'t cure it. He gave me one year to live. I was all alone, when I was driving home from his office, and I got to thinking about a story that had been handed down from my great-great-grandfather. <br />\""In the story, he was captured by the Shawnee Indians. Well, the Indians had contracted the smallpox and passed it to him. He ended up making a big fire and practically cooked himself sitting next to it for so long, but it cured his smallpox,\"" said Burris.<br />\'Getting in the hot tub saved my life,\' said Burris. \'Now I\'m hooked on them, I guess.\'<br />\""I got to thinking that if he could cure the smallpox through heat, then maybe I could cure Valley Fever using heat too. I had a hot tub at home and I would go and heat the hot tub as hot as I could stand it. I would get it 108-110 degrees, and my wife would help me when it was time to get out of it. <br />\""After she would get me out, she would cover me up with quilts and things, and I would go lay down. After I woke up, everything around me would be wringing wet. A few days of doing that and I started to feel better. I cured that Valley Fever, with heat.<br />\""After that, I needed a change so we moved to Mobile County. There were clear, blue skies there, and I really loved living there too. It was nice. There was no snow and hardly any rain,\"" said Burris.<br />In Mobile County, Burris built another home. A truly unique residence, the home featured heated floors, plumbing, and piping, all engineered by Burris. In addition to the exceptional home, Burris insisted on having another hot tub, a feature that, to this day, he just won\'t live without.<br />At nearly 80 years old, Burris had already designed and built two homes, but his desire to build would, yet again, lead him into another project. With ardent loyalty, Burris invested much time into the creation of a large windmill, all hand crafted. <br />\""I built a little room in the top of the windmill, and my friends and I would all go up there from time to time and enjoy a martini,\"" said Burris. \""Everybody always looked forward to visiting the windmill.\""<br />Among Burris\' many accomplishments, he was a public speaker for the Rotary Club, a position that he acquired through his participation in the Toastmaster\'s Club, and traveled throughout the nation, telling individuals about his life and the time he spent, as a teenager, traveling from Missouri to California, during the Great Depression. <br />Two years after the passing of Burris\' wife, in 2012, he relocated to Tennessee. Currently, Burris resides with his oldest daughter Melodee.<br />\""No one could imagine the miracles that helped me to survive, but I did survive and I\'m here today. I\'ve learned a few things. ... A lot of people find something and stick to it, but I never could. I may have failed at a lot of things but I also succeeded at a lot of things. Either way, I was always happy,\"" said Burris.<br />References^ rtownsend@stategazette.com (news.google.com)<br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEXaE8o33hY22nijXHUgbGWmRMpFA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=b6vSVtH5MMa3atG_j6AO&url=http://www.stategazette.com/story/2281536.html,EN,,28/02/2016 08:11,2016-02-28 05:02:00+00:00,e0a6a790e1,State Gazette,,,,,1456639320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Supplied: Isabel Beasley)<br />Marine scientists are searching for a baby humpback dolphin that was spotted off far north Queensland with netting tightly wrapped around its neck.The calf has been seen with its mother in waters off Cairns twice since the end of September, but James Cook University\'s Isabel Beasley has unsuccessfully looked for it for over the last week. <br />The hunt is on to find and save the calf from the net. (Supplied: Isabel Beasley)<br />Dr Beasley said the two looked healthy but feared the netting would not break down any time soon.\""It\'s important anyone who sees this calf reports it to the RSPCA hotline,\"" she said.\""During my recent survey work in the Cairns region I have unfortunately seen large amounts of litter in the water which can be fatal to marine creatures.\""WWF Australia spokesman Darren Grover said the case was a prime example of the impact of rubbish on marine life.\""That netting will ultimately cause the calf\'s death as it cuts deeper and deeper into the tissue,\"" he said. <br />Dr Isabel Beasley said she doesn\'t expect the netting to break down any time soon.

f36fb3b2e2,Dog pack killing cattle in Western Grove area - Newton County Times,"Dog pack killing cattle in Western Grove area | News<br />WESTERN GROVE - Newton County Sheriff\'s Office Investigator Glenn Wheeler reports a rash of attacks on livestock by dogs in the Western Grove area over the last few weeks.\""A local farmer started finding dead calves with their noses, lips and ears missing\"" Wheeler said. \""At first, he believed the calves were dying of blackleg or some other disease and the missing ears, lips and noses were just due to scavengers finding the calves before he did.\""Wheeler says the calves ranged in weight from 300 to nearly 600 pounds.<br />That continued intermittently over a few weeks until someone saw a pack of dogs in a paddock containing several recently weaned calves. The dogs were chasing the calves and catching them by the nose and killing them.The men shot at the dogs, believing they hit one. The other dogs ran away, but not before doing great damage. The death toll in the paddock that morning was nine calves.When the calves were inspected they were missing their noses, lips and ears just as the earlier calves had been. \""That\'s when he called the Sheriff\'s Office and got us involved,\"" Wheeler said.<br />Deputies and investigators began checking the area for dogs fitting the description, visiting with neighbors and residents around the area. They began searching for an owner of the dogs, which appeared to be well kept and not strays, but no owners were initially located.\""The attacks stopped for nearly three weeks,\"" Wheeler stated, \""but then the dogs started up again, killing several more calves in Newton County and at least two pigs just over into Boone County. On other farms just over the county line, the dogs have apparently chased cattle through fences as well.\"" One family alone has lost 31 calves. \""That is a huge financial blow,\"" Wheeler said.Over the weekend, the dogs were discovered to be back chasing calves and a farmer was able to shoot at least one of the dogs, but it ran away and they were unable to find it. The Sheriff\'s Office was called back and, with the help of the farmers and several local residents of both Newton and Boone counties, were able to find the owner of the dog that had been shot and the likely owner of another one.<br />There are different dogs seen in the pack, but a couple are always there, as if they recruit other dogs, Wheeler said.\""We believe we have found the owner of the main dog involved, the one that is always in the pack.\"" he added. \""Hopefully we can get this stopped before more livestock are killed or injured.\""Wheeler asks area farmers to keep a close eye on their livestock and report any deaths or injuries that might be related to the dogs.<br />\""We also want people to remember that they are responsible for the actions of their dogs and can be held liable for damages,\"" Wheeler said. \""And, owners of livestock need to remember they have the right to protect their animals from attack. If a dog or any other animal is chasing or attacking your livestock, you have the right to stop that threat. Of course, we want people to do so safely and not risk human lives doing so.\""Sheriff Keith Slape agrees.\""When families depend on livestock for their income, they have to be protective of their animals,\"" Slape said. \""One family in this situation is easily out over $30,000 due to these dogs.\""<br />If you have information about the attacks or if you are in the area and believe they have been in your livestock, you are asked to contact the Newton County Sheriff\'s Office at (870) 446-5124.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGnrDZ9VDiCVD_KHmWTThebUY4ecg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779761120973&ei=wGtYWrDCOIuZWLqXovAD&url=http://newtoncountytimes.com/news/dog-pack-killing-cattle-in-western-grove-area/article_3243f8b2-f62c-11e7-a9fe-4b70deb554d9.html,EN,,12/01/2018 08:01,2018-01-11 20:10:20+00:00,c9593f6e51,Newton County Times,,,,,1515705020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f3c4520045,The 10 diseases that could kill you in just ONE day revealed - Daily Mail,"The 10 diseases that could kill you in just ONE day revealed<br />Cancer, heart disease and HIV - all strike fear into the heart of patients handed the devastating diagnoses.They are chronic diseases, that progress over time and ultimately each can prove fatal.While they can kill, they do so over a prolonged period of time.But, perhaps more terrifying, is existence of a number of diseases infinitely more potent and capable of killing within 24 hours.Last year headlines around the world revealed the unfolding Ebola epidemic sweeping through the Western African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.To date, 11,314 people have lost their lives to the vicious virus, according to the WHO, and the disease reached the shores of the US, UK, Spain and other nations during the crisis.With no known cure, and a lack of vaccine, the disease can wipe out whole communities rapidly, with many victims succumbing to their symptoms within hours.Scroll down for video  From Ebola, pictured under the microscope, which has killed 11,314 people since an epidemic swept West Africa last year, to meningitis and MRSA, here we reveal 10 of the most potent diseases in the worldFor the majority of the world\'s population, diseases like Ebola, dengue fever and cholera are unlikely to be a threat.But other diseases, joining the list with Ebola as potentially deadly in a matter of hours, include meningitis, stroke and MRSA - all prevalent across the world.Here, we reveal 10 of the world\'s most deadly diseases... 1. NECROTISING FASCIITIS Commonly referred to as a \'flesh eating\' bug, necrotising fasciitis, can quickly spread through the body, killing the body\'s soft tissue.It is a very serious bacterial skin infection that can kill sufferers within a short period of time.Though deadly, this disease is rare.It can be caused by more than one type of bacteria, with A Streptococcus (group A strep) the most common trigger of the disease.Usually, infections from group A strep bacteria are generally mild and are easily treated. But, in cases of necrotising fasciitis, bacteria spread rapidly once they enter the body. They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia, connective bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia. Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect, causing it to die. When this happens, the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death.Each year in the United States, there are about 650 to 850 cases of necrotising fasciitis caused by group A strep.  Commonly referred to as a \'flesh eating\' bug, necrotising fasciitis, can quickly spread through the body, killing the body\'s soft tissue. It is a very serious bacterial skin infection, commonly triggered by A streptococcus, pictured, that can kill sufferers within a short period of time2. MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASEMeningococcal disease, also referred to as cerebrospinal meningitis is a contagious bacterial disease caused by the meningococcus (Neisseria meningitidis).It is spread by person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets of infected people. There are three main clinical forms of the disease: the meningeal syndrome, the septic form and pneumonia. The onset of symptoms is sudden and death can follow within hours. In as many as 10-15 per cent of survivors, there are persistent neurological defects, including hearing loss, speech disorders, loss of limbs, mental retardation and paralysis. Meningococcal disease can cause meningitis as well as meningococcal septicemia, both of which can prove fatalN. meningitidis inhabits the mucosal membrane of the nose and throat, where it usually causes no harm. Around five to 10 per cent of a population may be asymptomatic carriers. These carriers are crucial to the spread of the disease as most cases are acquired through exposure to asymptomatic carriers.The disease is more common among infants, adolescents and young adults.There are five serogroups (\""strains\"") of Neisseria meningitidis: A, B, C, W, and Y that cause most disease worldwide. Three of these serogroups (B, C, and Y) cause most of the illness seen in the United States.A common outcome of the disease is meningitis.The protective membranes covering a sufferers brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges, become infected and swell.Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, a stiff neck and aversion to light.Nausea, vomiting and confusion are also common.The symptoms can appear quickly and typically develop within three to seven days of exposure to the disease.Infants suffering meningitis are often slow or inactive, irritable, vomiting or feed poorly.If a parent suspects their child has meningitis they should contact a doctor straight away.Meningococcal meningitis is extremely serious and can be fatal.In severe cases it can cause death in a matter of hours.Another common outcome of meningococcal infection is bloodstream infection, septicemia.When someone has meningococcal septicemia, the bacteria enter the bloodstream and multiply, damaging the walls of the blood vessels and causing bleeding into the skin and organs.Symptoms include fatigue, vomiting, cold hands and feet, chills, severe aches, rapid breathing, diarrhea and in the later stages, a tell-tale purple rash.Meningococcal septicemia is very serious and can be fatal. In fatal cases, deaths can occur in as little as a few hours. In non-fatal cases, permanent disabilities can include amputation of toes, fingers, or limbs or severe scarring as a result of skin grafts.3. CHAGAS DISEASEChagas disease is a potentially life-threatening illness triggered by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi).The parasite is typically found in Latin America, where it is transmitted to humans via the faeces of triatomine bugs, known as \'kissing bugs\'.Around six to seven million people across the world are thought to be infected, the WHO estimates.Though potent and potentially deadly, the disease is curable if treatment is initiated soon after infection. Chagas disease is a potentially life-threatening illness triggered by the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, typically found in Latin America, where it is transmitted to humans via the faeces of \'kissing bugs\', picturedThe disease presents itself in two stages.The first, acute phase, lasts for around two months after infection.During this initial phase a high number of parasites circulate the blood, but in most cases symptoms are absent or mild.In less than half of those bitten by a \'kissing bug\', the first visible sign is a skin lesion or purple swelling of the eye lids, accompanied by a fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, muscle pain, difficulty breathing, swelling and abdominal or chest pain.During the chronic stage, the parasites are typically hidden away in the heart and digestive muscles.Around one in three patients suffer cardiac disorders, while 10 per cent suffer enlarged colon or oesophagus and other disgestive problems.In later years those infected can suddenly die or suffer heart failure caused by the progressive destruction of the heart muscle and the nervous system.There are a handful of medications that are 100 per cent effective in curing the disease, if they are given soon after infection, at the beginning of the acute phase.4. CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASEA cerebrovascular accident is also known, more widely as a stroke.A stroke is caused by the interruption of the blood supply to the brain, usually because a blood vessel bursts or is blocked by a clot.The interruption cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients, causing damage to the brain tissue. WHO estimates that more than 17.5 million people died of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke in 2012.The good news, however, is that 80 per cent of premature heart attacks and strokes are preventable. Healthy diet, regular physical activity, and not using tobacco products are the keys to prevention.  A stroke is caused by the interruption of the blood supply to the brain, usually because a blood vessel bursts or is blocked by a clot. The interruption cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients, causing damage to the brain tissueChecking and controlling risk factors for heart disease and stroke such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar or diabetes is also very important.The most common symptom of a stroke is a sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm or leg, most often affecting one side of the body.Other signs include confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, difficulty seeing with one or both eyes, difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance of co-ordination, severe headache with no known cause, fainting or unconsciousness.The effects of a stroke depend on which part of the brain is injured and how severely it\'s affected.A very severe stroke can cause sudden death.5. MRSAMRSA, which stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is a bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics.In the community, many people carry the bacteria, and most MRSA infections affect the skin.However, in hospitals and medical facilities, MRSA causes life-threatening blood infections, pneumonia and infections at the site of surgical procedures. Symptoms of MRSA infections in the community are a bump that appears on the skin, which is red, swollen, painful and warm to touchAnyone can catch MRSA through direct contact with an infected wound.Studies reveal about one in three people carry staph in their nose, usually without any symptoms or illness.Two in 100 people carry MRSA.Symptoms of MRSA infections in the community are a bump that appears on the skin, which is red, swollen, painful, warm to touch, full of pus and often accompanied by a fever, according to the CDC.Treatment often involves a doctor draining the wound before prescribing a treatment of antibiotics.In hospitals and healthcare facilities, MRSA is typically spread from an infected wound and the contaminated hands of a healthcare worker.The only way to know if a person has an MRSA infection, is to test the infection in the laboratory.If an MRSA infection invades the body further than a skin infection, it can prove more serious.Signs of an invasive infection include a high temperature of 100.4F or 38C or above, chills, generally feeling unwell, dizziness, confusion, muscle aches and pains, pain, swelling and tenderness at the site of infection.Invasive MRSA infections include blood poisoning, also known as sepsis, which can lead to septic shock if a person\'s blood pressure plummets to a dangerously low level.Urinary tract infections, endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves, pneumonia, septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, a bone infection, are also serious forms of MRSA.6. CHOLERACholera is an acute intestinal infection, caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacteria, vibrio cholerae.It is extremely virulent, affecting both adults and children, and can kill within hours.The incubation period is short, spanning from less than one day to five.Those struck by the infection suffer copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly result in severe dehydration and death if treatment is not received quickly.Around eight in 10 sufferers will develop no symptoms, but the bacteria can live in their faeces for up to 10 days, and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people.Among those who do suffer the symptoms, 80 per cent have mild or moderate experiences, while 20 per cent are at risk of the potentially fatal severe dehydration. Cholera is an acute intestinal infection, caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacteria, vibrio cholerae. It is extremely virulent, affecting both adults and children, and can kill within hoursResearchers have estimated there are 1.4 to 4.3 million cases, and 28,000 to 142,000 deaths worldwide each year from cholera, according to the WHO.Around 80 per cent of cases can be treated successfully with oral rehydration salts.7. ENTEROVIRUS D68 Every year, millions of children catch enteroviruses that can cause coughing, sneezing and a fever.In 2014, the enterovirus most commonly infecting children was EV-D68, according to the CDC.From August 2014 to January this year, CDC experts confirmed a total of 1,153 people in 49 US states suffered respiratory illness caused by EV-D68.The virus was detected in specimens from 14 patients who died. From August 2014 to January 2015, CDC experts confirmed a total of 1,153 people in 49  US states suffered respiratory illness caused by EV-D68Infants, children and teenagers are at greater risk of enterovirsuses because their immune systems are less likely to have been exposed to the infections.As a result their young body\'s have not had a chance to build up the immunity required to fight the viruses.Those with asthma are at even greater risk of catching EV-D68.The virus is spread via sufferers\' saliva, and other respiratory secretions, when a person coughs or sneezes.It can also be picked up from household surfaces.Symptoms can vary, from the mild, including a fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough and muscle aches to the more severe.In more serious cases, it can cause wheezing and severe breathing difficulites, which can ultimately cause death.There is no specific treatment for EV-D68, but doctors can advise on the best way to control the condition. 8. BUBONIC PLAGUEKnown by the ominous name, the \'Black Death\', during the fourteenth century, the Bubonic Plague caused an estimated 50 million deaths.It is the most common form of the plague, and is caused by the bite of an infected flea from a small animal, like a rat.Plague bacillus, Y.pestis, enters at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node, where it replicates itself.The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful and is called a \'bubo\'.In the advanced stages of infection, the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores.These days the plague is endemic in many African countries, Russia, the Americas and Asia.Plague can be a very severe disease in humans, with a case-fatality ratio of 30 to 60 per cent, if it\'s left untreated.In 2013, there were 783 cases reported across the world, according to the WHO, with 126 people losing their lives. A male oriental rat flea, a carrier of the Bubonic Plague or Black Plague. Plague bacillus, Y.pestis, enters at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system, where it causes the lymph node to become inflamedPeople infected with the plague often complain of \'flu-like\' symptoms in the early stages of the disease.Typically, a sudden onset of fever followed by chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea.Left untreated plague can be fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential.Antibiotics and supportive therapies can help treat sufferers.9. EBOLA Across the world 11,314 people have lost their lives to Ebola, with an additional 26,635 cases.The majority of those occured in the West African nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, following an outbreak in December 2013.On November 7, the WHO declared Ebola transmission had been stopped in Sierra Leone .The country has now entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance, which is set to come to an end on February 5 next year.In Guinea, no confirmed cases were reported in the week to November 8, and a total of four cases have been recorded in the last 21 days - all of whom are members of the same family.Sixty-nine contacts are being monitored, with 60 thought to be at high-risk of testing positive for the virus.Liberia has recorded no cases in the past 21 days.Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent. The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees.Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. Across the world 11,314 people have lost their lives to Ebola, with an additional 26,635 cases. The majority of those occured in the West African nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, following an outbreak in December 2013In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest.Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer\'s blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim\'s soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles.Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery.Those at risk during an outbreak include:health workersfamily members or others in close contact with infected people mourners with direct contact with the bodies of deceased victims hunters in contact with dead animals Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding.The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms.Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them.But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.10. DENGUE FEVERDengue fever is a disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito.It is estimated that there are more than 100 million cases of dengue across the world, each year.The more severe form of dengue, is dengue haemorrhagic fever.If left undiagnosed, DHF can prove fatal.It is caused by the same viruses that cause the lesser strain, dengue fever.Symptoms of the condition are high fever, severe headache, severe pain behind the eyes, joint pain, muscle and bone pain, a rash and mild bleeding from the nose or gums. Dengue fever is a disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. It is estimated that there are more than 100 million cases of dengue across the world, each yearYounger children and those suffering their first infection, experience milder symptoms in general, than older children and adults afflicted with the condition.Dengue haemorrhagic fever is characterised by a fever, which lasts from two to seven days.This is on top of the general symptoms of dengue fever.As the fever wears off, a sufferer will experience persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain and could develop a difficulty breathing.This stage marks the beginning of a 24 to 48-hour period when the smallest blood vessels, the capillaries, become \'leaky\' and allow the fluid component to escape the blood vessels into the lining of the abdominal cavity.This, in turn, can trigger failure of the circulatory system, shock and ultimately death, if doctors are unable to reverse the breakdown of the circulatory system.There is no specific drugs to treat dengue fever, or its more severe cousin, DHF.However, if an early diagnosis is made in a case of DHF, fluid replacement therapy can prove effective.Outbreaks of dengue fever occur where the mosquito carriers live, typically tropical parts of the world.Unlike other tropical diseases, there is no vaccine to protect against dengue fever.Using air conditioning or window and door screens, minimise the risk of mosquitoes coming inside.Repellents containing 20 to 30 per cent DEET can also reduce the risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito.  <br />#datearemp<br />#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHNHp-kPK3LlWyjrYlFlV8iZ2ieOg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52778997006989&ei=nynEVpj0KpC0aO31kfAD&url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3322931/Revealed-10-diseases-kill-just-ONE-day.html,EN,,17/02/2016 08:05,2015-11-20 14:29:04+00:00,5705f8234a,Daily Mail,,,,,1448033344,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
009c4d8b7f,Mid Tyrone Lamb Producer Group holds its annual general meeting - Farming Life,"Mid Tyrone Lamb Producer Group holds its annual general meeting\n\n\n		A successful Annual General Meeting for the Mid Tyrone Lamb Producer Group was held in Aughabrack Community hall on 6th February. \n\n				There was a great turnout of members regardless of the snowy weather conditions.\n\n   Roy Taylor joins fellow guest speakers Graham Campbell from CAFRE Rush Management and Dominic McCann from NI Water alongside the 2017-18 Mid Tyrone Lamb Producer\'s Group at their AGM in Aughabrack. Pictured from the committee are Martin Brogan, Leslie Buchanan, PRO, Rufus McFarland, Peter McBride, Bob Henry, John Francis Devine, Brian Kerlin, Eugene McCrossan, Treasurer, Paddy Joe Kearney, Coordinator, Hugh Devine, and Seamus Kearney, Secretary.\n      	\nThe night kicked off with guest speaker, Graeme Campbell. Graeme, who works for CAFRE, gave the group a great insight into the ongoing rust control programme at the Greenmount hill farm Glenwherry. Graeme\'s work focuses on pasture improvement with emphasis on rushes, and he was able to share his understanding of best practices. To carry on from this presentation, all members were asked to put forward their names for a visit to see Graeme\'s work and the newly built sheep house and handling facility at Glenwherry. \n\n   Paul Gallagher from Dunbia taking questions from the floor at the Mid Tyrone Lamb Producer Group\'s AGM.\n      	\nThe second speakers were Roy Taylor and Dominic McCann from NI Water. This presentation focused on the local Derg Water Treatment Works where they supply high quality drinking water to the area at a rate of 25 million litres per day. They emphasised the need to be environmentally responsible and ensure slurry and pesticides do not pollute the water courses. Contaminating of water courses not only carries the risk of farmer penalties, but has a financial impact on the water treatment works and of course biodiversity.  \n\n   Leslie Shiels from Marie Curie speaking at the event in Aughabrack.\n      	\nThe third speaker was Paul Gallagher from Dunbia. Understandably, as the lamb group, this was the most anticipated speaker. The group learnt of how pricing is affected by the European market and lamb numbers from the Mid Tyrone Lamb Group. Paul also emphasised the need for farmers to be aware of lameness as impaired locomotion can lead to welfare inspections.One of the highlights of the night was the presentation of £1,000 to Leslie Shields on behalf of Marie Curie raised by the Mid Tyrone Lamb Producer Group. \n\n   Cahal Devine, Liam Roddy, Bertie McKelvey and Mark Armstrong at the AGM.\n      	\nThis was a great achievement for the group as it went to a charity that has helped so many in the community.The night ended with the election of officers for the up and coming year. Chairman: Martin Brogan, vice chairman: Bob Henry, treasurer: Eugene McCrossan, secretary: Seamus Kearney, assistant secretary: John Francis Devine, co-ordinator: Paddy Jo Kearney, press release officer: Rachel Boggs, committee members: Hugh Devine, Mark Armstrong, Brian Kerlin, Rufus McFarland, Leslie Buchanan It is with thanks to the group\'s sponsors that the group held an impressive draw to close the meeting. There were six lots of 50 tags, vouchers and numerous bottle of animal drenches to name a few and several happy winners.

206393477,"Two hurt, pigs killed in crash involving semitrailer loaded with sows - MLive.com","Two hurt, pigs killed in crash involving semitrailer loaded with sows\n\n\n        HANOVER TWP., MI - A woman was in critical condition, and many pigs perished Wednesday after a semitrailer hauling a load of sows struck an SUV in Hanover Township, south of Jackson.\nThe woman was heading east about 2:36 p.m. Aug. 8 on Hanover Road. She reportedly stopped and then pulled into the path of the semitrailer, traveling south on Moscow Road, Jackson County Sheriff\'s Deputy Timothy Roberts said.\nBoth the woman and the truck driver went to Henry Ford Allegiance Health. Police at the scene characterized the woman\'s injuries as \""very critical.\"" The truck driver had what were said to be minor injuries.\n\""I just saw the semi, the trailer flying through the air,\"" said Laura Hart, who works at Cutty Sark, a restaurant at the intersection.\nShe and the owner, Doug Lyons, heard screaming. Not immediately knowing the contents of the trailer, it was impossible to tell whether the sound was coming from people or animals, Lyons said.\nThe semitrailer landed on its side, across both lanes of Moscow Road and pigs escaped, running about the area and into a cornfield along the west side of the road. Witnesses described a chaotic scene of scurrying, squealing sows. Some were motionless in or near the road.\n\""It was one of the worst things I have ever seen,\"" said Denise Powell, who has lived at Hanover and Moscow roads all her life. She too described what sounded like human screams.\n\""It was just dead carnage.\"" \nThe sight of it will haunt her for some time, she said.\n\n\n \n\nFive to six people immediately went to help the woman, said Powell\'s husband, Don, who saw the crash from their porch. He said the truck driver tried, but could not avoid the impact.\n\""I did a prayer, kept saying \'Jesus, be with her,\"" Denise Powell said.\nLocal farmers and others rushed into the area with tractors and heavy equipment to provide aid.\nWith some difficulty, they corralled the live pigs into trailers and drove them to the Alexander\'s Na-Lar Farms, 5815 Hanover Road. Larry Alexander, whose son Jeff now owns the farm, estimated there were 40 to 50 pigs there.\nHe said they had an empty barn and the pigs were being fed, watered and cooled. \""Trying to take the stress off them,\"" he said.\nA veterinarian, Dr. Christine Kostesich of Countryside Veterinary Service in Somerset Township, was to go from the intersection to the farm to re-evaluate the pigs and determine whether any require humane euthanization. A farmer and emergency personnel had summoned her for assistance, and she was there for \""welfare assessment,\"" to assure compassionate treatment. \""We don\'t want to prolong suffering.\""\nSome pigs were euthanized at the crash site. Employees from Bob Evan Farms, 200 N. Wolcott St., in Hillsdale had what a deputy called a bolt gun, a quiet device specifically designed for such a purpose.\nThe semitrailer, with a Manitoba, Canada license plate, was taking the pigs to the Hillsdale facility, which butchers or harvests hogs. It was unclear to whom the animals belonged or from where they specifically came. \nA Bob Evans representative, talking on a cell phone along Moscow Road, declined to comment.\nLarry Alexander and a Hanover Township firefighter, Dale Jordon, estimated there were about 100 pigs on the trailer. Some might still be in the cornfields.\nMany of them died. They were taken by front-end loaders to a dump truck belonging to nearby Weir Farms on Reynolds Road and, no longer fit for human consumption, would likely be hauled to a rendering facility, farmers said.\nMen from the Weirs, Alexanders and Sears Farm, also on Reynolds Road, were there with tractors, fencing and manpower. They were moving busily for hours.\n\""Farmers do that,\"" Larry Alexander said.\nWhen someone is in stress, they all come around, he said.\n\""A lot of good people out here,\"" Jordon said. \""That\'s what happens out here... People help each other.\""\nJeff Weir and Ryan Earl, an employee, just happened to be passing through the area, to check irrigation, Earl said. \""Can\'t really walk away from that,\"" he said of the crash.\nThe intersection was closed for hours and remained so as of about 5:20 p.m. The small SUV was loaded onto a trailer, but the semitrailer remained in the road. It was gone by about 7:30 p.m.\n\""It\'s just a tough situation, a bad accident,\"" the veterinarian said and commended her community for its care and concern.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFdbjtU6Ep--HeRukJTofyB_Mlu8g&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=auhrW9i7KI_6zAae_LrYAg&url=https://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2018/08/two_hurt_pigs_killed_in_crash.html,EN,,09/08/2018 07:05,2018-08-08 20:49:00+00:00,7b34ef8790,MLive.com,,,,,1533768540,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The couple has joined forces with more than 50 other local farmers to help gather supplies for ranchers out west who have suffered from recent wildfires.(Photo: Zach Tuggle/Telegraph-Forum)Buy PhotoLYKENS TOWNSHIP - Hundreds of ranches scorched by wildfires may be more than 1,000 miles away, but Ohio farmers are still ready to help.\""It doesn\'t matter where you live - in agriculture, you have a common connection,\"" said Rose Hartschuh, who lives in the northwest corner of Crawford County.She and her husband, Greg, have joined forces with dozens of other nearby farmers to coordinate local volunteer efforts. So far, they\'ve collected hay, fence posts, spools of wire, calf milk replacer and supplemental electrolytes.It\'s a quite a collection for only a week of efforts. Hartschuh said everything they gather will benefit ranchers in Kansas.The fires burned for more than a week at the beginning of March, tearing through fields, barns, fences and houses in Colorado, Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma. More than 700,000 acres were destroyed in Kansas alone.\""It was the biggest wildfire in Kansas history,\"" Hartschuh said. \""Wildfires aren\'t necessarily uncommon out there, but this one was monumental.\""Buy PhotoGreg and Rose Hartschuh add calf milk replacer and electrolytes to the hundreds of hay bales they and more than 50 other farmers are taking to Kansas ranchers who have been affected by recent wildfires. (Photo: Zach Tuggle/Telegraph-Forum)Once she and her husband decided to help, Hartschuh said they realized the Sunflower State was a logical place to focus their efforts.\""We had some connections in Kansas,\"" she said. \""It was also the closest geographically to get supplies to.\""Not long after they started telling friends and family, donations started pouring in. A barn near the grain elevator in Lykens Township is serving as a collections hub.\""Tons of farmers have been bringing in supplies, and some ag businesses as well,\"" Hartschuh said.Their goal is to leave Friday with about 50 volunteers driving more than 30 truckloads of supplies.\""There are other people who aren\'t able to go, but have been pitching in donations,\"" Hartschuh said.The trip to Kansas will take nearly 16 hours. Most will return to Ohio the following day, but 19 are staying for a couple of days to help ranchers clean up and rebuild.\""In a lot of places, they actually cut the fences to give the cattle a chance to run free,\"" Hartschuh said. \""So a lot of what we\'ll do is rebuilding fence, clearing away debris and things like that.\""Host families will provide housing for those who stay to help. Hartschuh\'s husband was quick to point out Ohioans aren\'t the only ones helping.\""Probably every state is helping,\"" he said. \""It\'s all of agriculture working together to help each other.\""It\'s a sentiment Hartschuh said agriculturists everywhere share.\""We know if the tables were turned, and it was in Ohio, other farmers would come here and help,\"" she said.The group is still accepting donations - one thing they could still use is diesel money for the nearly 2,000-mile round trip.To help, call Hartschuh at 419-208--5502.ztuggle@gannett.com419-564-3508Twitter: @zachtuggleRead or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2nA8VcF",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGfOZeiySbLuPa1qJhg_8xi1SLZRQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=TDrOWJjyAYXHWf7cs7gJ&url=http://www.bucyrustelegraphforum.com/story/news/2017/03/17/local-farmers-help-save-kansas-ranches/99300286/,EN,,19/03/2017 08:03,2017-03-17 17:23:24+00:00,51fe179e08,Bucyrus Telegraph Forum,,,,,1489775004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
06194cd722,Summer Arts Preview: Concerts | The Daily Cardinal - The Daily Cardinal,"Summer Arts Preview: Concerts | The Daily Cardinal\n\nWith the last week of class coming to an end and finals creeping in, I\'m sure everyone is relieved to get some well-deserved time off. Now you may be thinking, \""What in the world am I supposed to do with all this free time now that I\'m not drowning in assignments?\"" The answer is go to as many concerts as is physically possible.Luckily, Madison is a hotspot for all kinds of music, so if you\'re here for the summer and need something to do, follow this semi-comprehensive guide. These are the shows I\'m looking forward to, but you should always take time to find new shows as well.\n\n				\n				What better way to celebrate another semester in Madison than to kick off summer with a concert from a UW student band? Hit up High Noon Saloon May 10 to catch Trophy Dad\'s first show after the release of their EP, Dogman. Be there or be square.\n				\n				\n				\n				Keep the concerts flowing through your blood a few days later by deciding between two killer choices: rapper Ab-Soul and rock band The Dear Hunter. Unfortunately for music lovers everywhere, they both play May 14 so you\'ll have to choose carefully. Find Ab-Soul at the Majestic Theatre and The Dear Hunter at High Noon Saloon.The next choice is obvious. Madison favorite, Hippo Campus rescheduled their visit for May 18 after a last minute cancellation in April. They\'ll be tearing up the stage at Majestic Theatre in front of what\'s sure to be a big crowd, so get there early if you want to try and make eye contact with one of the band members.May is the time to adventure outside your music comfort zone. A ton of smaller bands are performing across the city, and with a quick Google search you\'ll be able to find something that could spark a new interest.\n\n				\n				June is one of the best times for concerts, and on June 15, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony will be at the Orpheum. The legendary hip-hop group is definitely a must-see considering their status as a classic. Don\'t miss your opportunity.\n\n				\n				This next recommendation is a bit outside Madison city limits, but if you\'ve got a way to get to Eau Claire, then do everything you can to make that happen. For the third installment of Bon Iver frontman Justin Vernon\'s music festival, you\'ll have the chance to see a slew of hyper-talented artists. Taking place June 16 and 17, the Eaux Claires festival is hosting Chance The Rapper, Francis and the Lights, Sylvan Esso, Danny Brown, Wilco, Tweedy and a handful of other acts that are sure to blow your socks off. Plus, if you\'re a fan of camping, that\'s an option too.At this point you\'re probably thinking that these tickets are going to add up quick. We\'re supposed to be working to save for college right? That\'s where the next recommendation (read as requirement) comes in.Concert On the Square is an absolute essential if you\'re in or around Madison over the summer. The best part? It\'s free. Gather up a group of friends, a few old blankets, food and drinks and join hundreds of other people on the lawn of the Capitol for a night filled with music from the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra.Starting June 28, you can catch this amazing experience every Wednesday until August 2. Do yourself a favor: go have a spectacular night with your closest friends and family.I\'m going to cheat again and throw in another festival that is outside of Madison, but it\'s a Wisconsin essential: Summerfest. Superstars like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Migos, Big Sean and Future will all be headlining, which means their shows will cost a bit extra, but it\'s worth it. Other stars like Steve Aoki, Flume and The Shins will all be playing on side stages, which means you can see them for a super low price of admission. On top of that, there\'s endless potential to discover new bands playing on one of the 11 different stages. This year T-Pain will also be performing one night which basically guarantees you\'ll have the chance to hear him make \""mansion\"" and \""Wisconsin\"" rhyme while actually in Wisconsin. It\'s pretty much a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Summerfest runs from June 28 to July 9 in downtown Milwaukee.Indie folk band The Mountain Goats will be at Majestic Theatre on July 8 to woo the crowd with a flawless combo of fun alt-rock and modern folk. Their music is extremely pleasing so grab a friend and stroll on in. Even if you haven\'t heard them before, you won\'t regret it.This list only goes through the beginning of July, but it\'s a solid starting point for some of the bigger acts that will be in the area for everyone who\'s spending the summer in town. This summer is a perfect time to explore new places, try new things and find new music. Make the most of your time off.\n\n																																																																																																																																																																															\n                             	Subscribe to The Daily Cardinal Newsletter[1]\n\n			References^ Subscribe to The Daily Cardinal Newsletter (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHO38-gCCNXH5dkyx4BCGDZDXwq-A&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779478325497&ei=XS8IWcj2JMHkWYXyg4AB&url=http://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/05/summer-arts-preview-concerts,EN,,02/05/2017 07:03,2017-05-01 09:04:39+00:00,5b41d61294,The Daily Cardinal,,,,,1493636679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0663689dbb,Red meat allergy in Mississippi - The Clarion-Ledger - Jackson Clarion Ledger,"Red meat allergy in Mississippi\n\nCLOSE\n    Electronics and cellular technology have been game-changers in trapping wild hogs.\n    Brian BroomWhat you need to know about alpha-galDillon Walker of Brandon contracted red meat allergy from a tick bite and now the only wild game he can eat are birds and waterfowl.(Photo: Special to Clarion Ledger)For many Mississippians, spring is a time for outdoor activities. Hiking, camping and wildlife watching are all popular and many hunters will be planting warm season food plots and doing other habitat work. But with warmer weather coming, being outdoors can put you at risk of contracting red meat allergy.\""I graduated from Mississippi State,\"" said Dillon Walker of Brandon. \""I\'m a forester.\""I went to work for a timber consulting company right out of school. Within two or three months of working there I started breaking out pretty bad. I started breaking out in hives and my throat started swelling shut. The symptoms were pretty scary the first few times.\""Walker thought he was having allergic reactions to certain foods, so he stopped eating wheat, peanut and dairy products, but he continued to have bouts of anaphylactic shock. After seeing a doctor, it was determined he needed to have his gall bladder removed.Walker had the surgery performed, but the symptoms continued to reappear.\""I kept breaking out,\"" Walker said. \""My mom said I needed to go to a specialist.\""Tick-borneWalker went to a specialist who asked if he was exposed to ticks. Of course, being a forester, Walker answered yes. At that point, it was discovered Walker had developed red meat allergy, often called alpha-gal.A bite from a lone star tick can cause red meat allergy in humans.\r\r (Photo: James Gathany/CDC)\""Alpha-gal is a carbohydrate,\"" said Jerome Goddard, extension professor of medical entomology at Mississippi State University. \""It\'s safe to say it\'s a sugar. It\'s a sugar that\'s in mammal cells, but not in humans.\""And outdoorsmen and women are sensitized to the carbohydrate by something they often encounter in warm seasons - lone star ticks.\""When a tick feeds it sucks up alpha-gal,\"" Goddard said. \""When they feed later, they spit saliva back out.\""When it feeds it kind of spits it back into you. Then you\'re sensitized to alpha-gal.\""Goddard said symptoms are much like those experienced by Walker; hives, throat swelling, difficulty breathing, cramps and sometimes diarrhea. \""It\'s really your body killing itself,\"" Goddard said. \""It\'s your own body overreacting.\""Other food allergies typically cause the human body to react within minutes, but alpha-gal takes longer. That\'s why diagnosing it is more difficult.\""This one is like three to eight hours later,\"" Goddard said. \""That\'s what makes it different.\""People wake up in the middle of the night after eating a steak and are like, \'What is this?\'\""But the source of allergic reactions isn\'t limited to a big ribeye steak. Doctor Patricia Stewart, who specializes in allergies and immunology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center said it extends well beyond that.\""It\'s red meat and most people think of beef,\"" Stewart said. \""It\'s more than that.\""People don\'t think of pork as red meat, but it is. I live in fear of getting it, actually. Doctors fear the things they treat and I couldn\'t live without bacon.\""Most of the common wild game species in Mississippi can cause an allergic reaction for those with red meat allergy. Deer, squirrels, rabbits, raccoons are all on the list, as are livestock such as goats and sheep.That\'s a little problematic for Walker, who is an avid deer hunter, but it doesn\'t keep him from hunting.\""I have a big family,\"" Walker said. \""Whatever I kill, my family members get the meat. I still get to enjoy the hunt.\""Fortunately for Walker, he also enjoys turkey and duck hunting, both of which he can eat.Time to actStewart pointed out that now is the time of year when people need to take precautions.\""The time of year is whenever the ticks are moving around the most,\"" Stewart said. \""It\'s usually from late spring until late fall.\""If you\'re walking around in tall grass, you need to take precautions.

08137fe14a,Robbie Savage loses his six-pack (and his sun cream) as he holidays in Barbados - Daily Mail,"Robbie Savage loses his six-pack (and his sun cream) as he holidays in Barbados\n\n\nBy\n\nDaily Mail Reporter[1]\n\n\n\n\n  Published:\n  22:22 GMT, 10 April 2013\n\n | \n  Updated:\n  09:14 GMT, 11 April 2013\n\n\n\n\nHe\'s the footballer who was once dubbed the dirtiest player in Premier League history, due to his playing style.  And these days it seems Robbie Savage has left more than the yellow cards behind from his footballing past, as his once near perfect physique was also nowhere to be seen. The 38-year-old, who retired from the game two years ago, was spotted looking a far cry from his former footballer self while holidaying with his wife Sarah and two children in Barbados.               Letting loose: Robbie Savage showed off a slightly softer body than usual as he holidayed in Barbados\n\n              \n              \n\nSomeone has caught the sun!The former footballer looked a little red as he strolled along the beach \n              Opps: Robbie was caught off guard by a wave which soaked his blue shorts But the famous blonde seemed to be \nmore than aware of his expanding waist line, as he tweeted a picture of \nhimself sucking in his stomach, which he captioned: \'@GaryLineker doing \nmy best Gary impression on holiday so hard breathing in lol !!\'\n\nRobbie\n is of course referring to the impressive body fellow former player Gary\n was spotted showing off earlier this year on his family holiday. It\n seems Robbie was more concerned with catching the sun than working out \nas he appeared a little on the red side as he took a stroll along the \nsand.\n        \n        \n\nFrom six-pack to soft: Robbie has lost his toned footballer\'s physique which was honed during his time on Strictly Come Dancing\n              Never far from the real world: Robbie held his phone in his hand even when playing by the water\'s edge\n              Woah there: Robbie and his son got very wet as a wave struck them as they played on the beach\n\nDressed in a pair of blue shorts, \nwhich didn\'t appear to be swimming ones, the Strictly star was spotted \ntaking a walk, with his T-shirt tucked into his shorts. Wearing\n a pair of Aviator sunglasses and with his hair slicked back, the vain \nstar was seen looking at his phone, perhaps taking a picture of himself.After a while he decided to paddle in the warm water and began to play around with his eldest son.\n              Doting dad: Robbie helped his eldest son after they got caught in a rather large wave\n However, not paying attention the pair got caught off guard by a wave and Robbie\'s shorts ended up getting completely soaked.Meanwhile Robbie\'s wife Sarah was also walking along the shoreline, showing off her enviable figure.The WAG looked toned and healthy in an orange halter-neck bikini, with her hair off her face in a messy ponytail.               Laughter: The footy star seemed to be enjoying his holiday laughing away while playing in the water\n              Beach ready: Robbie\'s wife showed off her great bikini body wearing an orange bikini\n Robbie last played for Derby County back in 2011 and throughout his career he played for numerous teams as well as for the Welsh national team. Since then, like Gary, he has become a pundit and currently presents 606 on BBC Radio 5 live. He also famously appeared on Strictly in 2011 on which he broke his nose after performing a dramatic knee-slide.But the accident didn\'t prevent him from being successful on the show and he finished in impressive sixth place.

They also covered Helmet, the Dwarves, and the Stooges on this thing, and those tracks are about as cool as they sound.\nPig Destroyer are a band where the total package is important-always ones to take great care with their artwork and lyrics, this collection unearths some \""lost\"" lyrics from the album, which vocalist JR Hayes has never been able to remember until he found an old notebook with the lyrics, as well as a bunch of new artwork.\nThe reissue is out May 20 via Robotic Empire (this is one of Pig Destroyer\'s rare non-Relapse releases). Pre-orders[1] are available now.\nYou can also now stream one of those lost demos. It\'s called \""Delusional Supremacy 2K,\"" it\'s a Pig Destroyer song, and you\'ve probably never heard it. Say no more. Stream that below.\n\n			        References^ Pre-orders (www.roboticempire.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEGiDO3BnoBILVd6SAJ2j2veqBSsQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=ito6V6CzI7f3zAaP2aXwBA&url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/pig-destroyer-reissuing-compilation-lp-painter-of-dead-girls-with-lost-demos-lyrics/,EN,,17/05/2016 08:51,2016-05-05 15:51:11+00:00,c1967ab863,Brooklyn Vegan (blog),,,,,1462470671,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0ba99f3289,Critics Accuse \'Deus Ex: Mankind Divided\' of Trivializing Black Lives Matter - Breitbart News,"Critics Accuse \'Deus Ex: Mankind Divided\' of Trivializing Black Lives Matter **UPDATE** Developer Responds\n\n\n				SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMarketing for the upcoming sci-fi RPG Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has proven controversial, adapting current racial politics and messaging to fit its dystopic cyberpunk future.\nUPDATE:SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nBioWare Gameplay Designer Manveer Heir has joined the conflagration, arguing the issue with Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Global Executive Brand Director Andre Vu on Twitter.\nHeir believes that regardless of team diversity, the marketing in question does not show that the Mankind Divided developers understand the inherent issues well enough. Vu counters with statements about people jumping to conclusions, joining the \""hate bandwagon\"" because it\'s easy to do, and making a decision about the game without context.\nHeir does make one clear point: Marketing in and of itself doesn\'t provide the context necessary to defend itself.\nWithout making this a long-winded analysis of an online slap fight, there are two very notable points in this conversation that will no doubt echo through many more in the future:\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\'s one heck of a coincidence. The bickering continues, with a virtually hopeless defensive position assailed by another grown man with an equally hopeless offensive one.\nBut coincidence or not, unless Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was developed and marketed by a colony sealed in an underground bunker[1], claiming to have come up with the slogan first doesn\'t exempt the team from backlash over hitting the big red button on their marketing. And let\'s face it - this is exactly the sort of thing that marketing wants to accomplish. Everyone is talking about Mankind Divided now[2].\nBut what does Manveer Heir and BioWare have to do with decisions made by Andre Vu and Eidos? And is a game literally called Mankind Divided context enough for imagery depicting division and strife? For that matter, what about the [Human Revolution spoiler warning] context provided by the previous game[3], and all of the other[4] marketing thus far[5]?\nRegardless of which side you take, both arguments feel just a bit disingenuous. The marketing team for Mankind Divided should have - and almost certainly did - expect this to get people talking about its next major title. So far, reactionary outrage is keeping the conversation from becoming a genuinely constructive one.\n \nORIGINAL STORY:\n\n\n\n\nIn the recently released concept art[6] for the next iteration of the Deus Ex franchise, cities across the globe are shown as they exist in that grim future. A \""mechanical apartheid\"" has forced early adopters of cybernetic augmentation into segregated areas. They are treated with distrust and abused by those in power and their fellow citizens.\nOne image in particular[7] - a depiction of rioting in Moscow - has ignited controversy among the gaming press[8]. A protester is seen holding a sign that reads \""AUGS LIVES MATTER\"" in obvious parallel to the Black Lives Matter movement. The marketing is being called \""insensitive,\"" and the people behind it accused of playing too lightly with heavy issues.\nThis isn\'t the first time Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has attracted this sort of attention[9]. The aforementioned \""mechanical apartheid\"" was a source of many of those same criticisms. Gilles Matouba, former director of the game, responded in a Reddit post to /r/KotakuInAction[10] to explain that he \""wanted to offer to our audience something unique. Something that was close and very personal to us: The experience of being torn between 2 worlds and 2 identities. Augs calling you the \'uncle Tom\' of the non-augs, non-augs always insecure when you\'re around, always deeply being scared or appalled by your mechanical body.\""\nSomehow, it was our own individual stories... We wanted to share a little part of our own life experience (on a super dramatized degree, of course) as visible minorities in a world of prejudices sometimes not well tailored for us.We also used the reference of south africa, israel, even brasil, french and american ghettos and any country ressorting to walls in order to segratgate a part of their own population. We meant it. This was important to us to not half-ass these analogies. BECAUSE THIS IS DEUS EX.Deus Ex is a very mature and thoughtful franchise that wants to hook gamers on essential questions and considerations: power, control, species, science, sociology, singularity, etc.Racism is a ey dark part of our human nature and we wanted to treat this subject. It was especially important for ME to treat this. (sic)\nHe\'s not wrong. Science fiction and fantasy have a long and storied history of examining real world issues through the lens of imaginative fiction. The detachment allows us to look at issues from angles that might otherwise be too uncomfortable for many people and has been an essential part of rounding out conversations in popular culture.\nDeus Ex in particular has never shied away from discussions on everything from systems of government to law enforcement, the balance between freedom and security, government and corporate overreach, corruption, and even the ethics of scientific study. Mankind Divided isn\'t treading new ground for the series so much as carrying on a bold tradition of addressing our fears and prejudices head-on.\nIt would be disingenuous to suggest that no one should feel any discomfort in seeing a current and violently divisive matter referenced in a video game. Gaming, as a newer medium, is still seen as more provocative than traditional media. But why is discomfort viewed as a bad thing?\n\n\n\n\nIf anything, Mankind Divided draws attention to Black Lives Matter, using it as a reference point for the next evolution of humanitarian crisis. Agree or disagree, it\'s a chance to safely explore the principles involved, outside our current circumstances.\nExecutive art director Jon Jacques-Belletête has previously called such controversy \""completely ridiculous,\"" lambasting people for treating them \""as little kids that are just doing video games\"" whenever a \""serious subject\"" is addressed in a virtual world.\nIf games are allowed to tell stories, there will always be those with which someone disagrees. I\'m not sure that means we should all stop telling stories. On the contrary, history has proven that the ability to employ metaphor in attempt to better understand both our world and ourselves is vital, perhaps now more than ever.\nFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.[11]\n			References^ sealed in an underground bunker (www.danspapers.com)^ Everyone is talking about Mankind Divided now (twitter.com)^ context provided by the previous game (www.youtube.com)^ the other (www.youtube.com)^ thus far (www.youtube.com)^ recently released concept art (www.deusex.com)^ One image in particular (cdn.sqexeu.com)^ ignited controversy among the gaming press (killscreen.com)^ attracted this sort of attention (www.breitbart.com)^ responded in a Reddit post to /r/KotakuInAction (www.reddit.com)^ @Get2Church (twitter.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGJYLpnXry5ClEkGPFzM7WRkQFtAg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779172553914&ei=CCyoV4iMCYeAzAaM96vgBg&url=http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/08/03/critics-accuse-deus-ex-mankind-divided-of-trivializing-black-lives-matter/,EN,,08/08/2016 07:09,2016-08-03 18:41:48+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,Breitbart News,,,,,1470256908,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patrick Baikauskas, pastor of St. Thomas Aquinas Church, 535 W. State St., was in Rome as one of 726 priests present at the Pope\'s announcement on Tuesday. He is one of 125 priests in the U.S. granted this responsibility during what is the Vatican\'s Jubilee Year, which ends in November. The 1,000 priests are being known both as the Missionaries of Mercy and as \""super-confessors.\""Speaking to priests in the Sala Regia near the Sistine Chapel, the Pope pronounced this to be a Holy Year of Mercy, a year of extending forgiveness and welcoming eager Catholics back into the fold after they\'ve strayed from their faith.\n        \""We are to be a sign and witness to the mercy of God through the Church. Our primary role is to promote the sacrament of reconciliation or confession,\"" said Baikauskas in an email.Grave sins include plotting to kill a pope, violating confessional secrecy and defiling consecrated bread and wine.\""(Forgiving sins) has been an important ministry at St. Tom\'s that has expanded greatly in the past couple of years, both in the opportunities and the number of people taking advantage of the expanded opportunities,\"" said Baikauskas.\n        Pope Francis emphasized love for those who came to confession with contrition. He said to the priests, \""It\'s not sin in front of us, but the repentant sinner ... a person who has the desire to be heard and forgiven, who promises to stay close to the house of the Father.\""Baikauskas said the Pope\'s move was about how the Church could better act as a witness to God\'s mercy.\""It is a huge honor, but it\'s not about me or the other missionaries,\"" Baikauskas said. \""I, in my way, am called to be a witness and sign of that mercy.\""\n        \n                                \n                            \n#datearemp\n#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNErFSIborAmn4IjJCoY9A9eQYJ_jA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779045089641&ei=hJO9VtiwAsOhauPFhLAL&url=http://www.purdueexponent.org/city_state/article_ba2bfd22-d0e7-11e5-ab99-a3c0d2218ca3.html,EN,,12/02/2016 08:11,2016-02-11 23:20:57+00:00,95c728a7b8,Purdue Exponent,,,,,1455236457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He later clarified his position saying, \""The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should absolutely not be funded.\""\nHe added, \""millions and millions of women - cervical cancer, breast cancer - are helped by Planned Parenthood.\""\nPerry, 32, explained her decision to donate to the organization in a lengthy caption on Instagram[1].\n\""It\'s time to turn words into action!\"" she began. \""There are so many steps to take, but my first vow is to support organizations that may have their funding support taken from them in the future by the government.\n\""I am making a public donation to Planned Parenthood for the teenage me who made several visits to first a clinic in Santa Barbara and then Los Angeles, CA to educate myself on my sexual health, a subject I had little to no information on because of my sheltered upbringing,\"" she wrote. \""I had no idea how things worked down there, and had no idea how to make a plan for them.\""\nPerry said the organization gave her the ability to \""focus on my dreams and us[e] my voice until I knew the timing was right for me to make a plan to have a family. Since then, I have been able to focus wholeheartedly on bringing messages of strength and becoming a voice for others. Without this education, I may have had a different life path.\""\nPerry added that although she had a singular experience with the health organization, she feels Planned Parenthood \""can sometimes be the only medical support low-income families ever see.\""\n\""I know what it\'s like to need help,\"" the singer said. \""I came from a lower- to middle-class family and never grew up with the option of health insurance.\""\nPerry ended her caption by explaining that Planned Parenthood gave Katheryn Hudson, Perry\'s birth name, \""the knowledge to plan.\""\n\""Now, more than ever, we all need to protect and create safe places for each other,\"" she continued. \""I hope I can help inspire you to make a gift as well, and become a member and an ally.\""\nShe concluded her note by encouraging others to \""show your support\"" to Planned Parenthood with the hashtag: \""#wewontgoback.\""\nPerry was outspoken during the 2016 presidential election.\nShe, along with other celebrities, campaigned for Democratic presidential nominee Clinton.

164f91898e,Sunshine flowers growing near ancient coral reef - Yorkshire Evening Post,"Sunshine flowers growing near ancient coral reef\n\n\n				\n\n		A chorus of resplendent buttercups and wild flowers appear to be celebrating the recent warm spell. The picture was taken of a meadow at Cracoe, near Grassington in the Yorkshire Dales.\n\n				Buttercups, otherwise known by their scientific name Ranunculus, are part of a large genus of about 600 species of plants. Members of the genus also include spearworts and water crowfoots.Ranunculus is Late Latin for \""little frog\"", the flowers probably being so named because they are frequently found growing near water. Buttercups are poisonous to cattle and cause swelling and blistering if eaten. However, they are usually safe to eat if bound up with hay as once cut, their toxins dissipate.\n                            \n            \n                            \n            The old myth that holding a buttercup under one\'s chin indicates a fondness (or not) for butter was investigated by a team of scientists in 2011. They didn\'t find any evidence that a glowing buttercup predicted a fondness for dairy products, however, they did find out why buttercups glow so brightly - their petals have two layers of reflective cells, with an air gap between, effectively doubling the amount of light they can reflect. Additionally, they are also very good at reflecting ultra-violet light, which might explain why they are so adept at attracting insects and so appealing to the eye in general.\n\n\n\n\nThe parish of Cracoe lies in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, not far from Rylstone and about six miles south-west of Grassington and also near Skipton. Incidentally, Cracoe was also home to some of the original Calendar Girls, members of the Women\'s Institute who bared all to raise money for charity and whose story has been told in film and on stage.The village has a population of only about 160 residents (178 according to the 2011 Census).It lies beneath Barden Fell and the twin skyline landmarks of Rylstone Cross and Cracoe Pinnacle.

1856b296a3,Top 7 Bible Verses About Silence - Patheos (blog),"Top 7 Bible Verses About Silence\n\nHere are seven Bible verses relating to silence.Proverbs 17:28 \""Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise; when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent.\""Sometimes it\'s better to say nothing at all than to say something that shows our ignorance, like the many times I\'ve spoken too quickly and rather unwisely, so silence can be golden, but even a foolish person is deemed wise by saying few words or by saying nothing at all. It\'s better to say nothing than to say something we\'ll later regret.Psalm 46:10 \""He says, \""Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.\""The psalmist wrote, \""we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble at its swelling\"" (Psalm 46:2-3), and even if \""The nations rage, the kingdoms totter; he utters his voice, the earth melts\"" (Psalm 46:6). All we need do is to rest in the fact that God is over all things and so we can be still and simply know that He is God, and He \""will be exalted among the nations\"" and \""in the earth.\"" Nothing can prevent that.Lamentations 3:26 \""It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.\""Solomon\'s wise words in Lamentations 3:26 are shown elsewhere in Scripture to be true. Isaiah the Prophet wrote, \""but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint\"" (40:31). By waiting upon the Lord, you\'re also waiting for His divine timing.Psalm 62:5 \""For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him.\""David was in dire straits when he wrote psalm 62. His life was in danger due to his son Absalom\'s taking over the throne of Israel. David had to escape but harder still, he had to deal with those who had betrayed him as he wrote they \""plan to thrust him down from his high position. They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse\"" (Psalm 62:4), but David didn\'t panic as he wrote, \""He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken\"" (Psalm 62:6).Psalm 141:3 \""Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips!\""Perhaps the psalmist is asking God for a little help in keeping his peace in waiting upon the Lord. He needs to have help in his silence and to keep his hand over his mouth from saying something that he might later regret, or even saying something out of frustration. This is why he prays \""Do not let my heart incline to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds\"" (Psalm 141:4).Proverbs 17:27 \""Whoever restrains his words has knowledge, and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.\""I think what Solomon is saying is that if we restrain our words, we have wisdom enough to know when to keep our mouths shut, because with many words comes the chance for saying the wrong thing. Sometimes is just better to say nothing at all, and in the context of this verse, the one \""who has a cool spirit\"" might be a person who knows how to hold their tongue and temper when angered, even when they don\'t feel like it.Isaiah 53:7 \""He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\""This verse is clearly speaking about Jesus during the Passion and when answering all of the false charges brought up against Him. When Jesus didn\'t defend Himself and kept silent before the charges when brought to Pontius Pilate, Pilate was amazed and said to Jesus, \""You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you\"" (John 19:10), but Jesus said, \""You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above\"" (John 19:11), meaning it was all part of the sovereign plan of God.ConclusionI could have also included Habakkuk who wrote, \""But the Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him\"" (Hab 2:20) which is a show of holy reverential respect for God, or Revelation 8:1 where the Apostle John wrote, \""And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\"" (Rev 8:1), perhaps due to what cataclysmic events were about to shortly take place, but most of these verses deal with how we should trust in God and wait upon Him and to \""be still\"" and know He is God.Article by Jack WellmanJack Wellman is Pastor of the Mulvane Brethren Church in Mulvane Kansas.

189931dfe6,"Uncomfortable summer heat makes people moody and unhelpful, new research finds - Science Daily","Uncomfortable summer heat makes people moody and unhelpful, new research finds -- ScienceDaily\n\nAssociate professor Liuba Belkin of Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Maryam Kouchaki, assistant professor at Northwestern in Evanston, Illinois, conclude in a new study, that when when it\'s uncomfortably hot, we\'re less likely to be helpful or \""prosocial.\""\nIn an interview with Quartz, lead author Belkin said, \""The point of our study is that ambient temperature affects individual states that shape emotional and behavioral reactions, so people help less in an uncomfortable environment, whatever the reason they come up with to justify why they cannot do.\""\nThe three-part study, \""Exploring the impact of ambient temperature on helping,\"" published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, helps to explain how and through what mechanisms ambient temperature influences individual helping.\nData provided by a large Russian retail chain for part one of the study allowed the authors to analyze differences in individual behavior under hot versus normal temperature conditions. Clerks working in an uncomfortably hot environment, according to the data, were 50% less likely to engage in prosocial behaviors, including: volunteering to help customers, listening actively, and making suggestions.\nLiuba says \""In part two of the study -- a randomized online experiment -- we asked paid online panel to just recall or imagine situations where they were uncomfortably hot and then, after measuring their feelings and perceptions and a number of survey questions, asked them to help with another survey for free. Participants weren\'t even experiencing heat at the moment -- and we still found that, compared to the control group, the participants were more fatigued, which reduced their positive affect and, ultimately, prosocial behavior.\""\nOnly 34% of the participants who were asked to recall a time when they were uncomfortably hot were willing to help with the free survey, compared to 76% in the control group. Interestingly, Belkin and her co-author also saw that recalling being uncomfortably hot also increased their negative affectivity, but it did not have any impact on prosocial behavior, while reduction in positive affect did.\nIn part three of the study, Belkin and her co-author found that even slight fluctuations in temperature changed behavior. Belkin chose students in two sections of a college management course as subjects for a field experiment (one group sat in a lecture in a room that was uncomfortably warm, the other group sat in a room that was held in an air conditioned room -- there was a 15% difference in the actual room temperature). She then asked the students to answer a series of questions and fill out a survey \""for a non-profit organization that serves children and underprivileged individuals in the local community.\""\nOnly 64% in the hotter room agree to answer at least one question, while in the cooler room 95% did so. Interestingly, even those who agreed to help in the hotter room, they helped less, answering, on average, 6 questions, almost 6 times less than the number of questions answered in the in cooler room (average 35).\nSome of those students probably wanted to leave and escape the stickier room, said Belkin to Quartz, \""but whatever the reason, it affected their perceptions, emotions and behavior.\""\nBelkin adds that she was also able to replicate the mechanism that drives reduction in prosocial behavior -- the same pattern of results as in study 2 showed that uncomfortably warm classroom temperature increased fatigue, reduced positive affect and led to less helping.\n								Story Source:\n								Materials provided by Lehigh Universitycesywudfecdtssavrctvad.

18e22e8463,Draper: Don\'t take it for granted - Agri News,"Draper: Don\'t take it for granted | Livestock\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                Hello from Graze-N-Grow. After reading a meteorologist forecast for a mild November last month, I\'m a little disappointed so far, but at least we have plenty of moisture going into winter. We will be done grazing the cover crops with our ram lambs later this month, and although they got off to a late start with the dry August and September, there has been some good late season growth.Rather than feeding the cows hay now, we\'ve been grazing the stockpiled Max-Q fescue instead. I may regret that this winter, but we\'ll see. The ewes are looking good and still have some forage yet, as well as the replacement ewe lambs, which Heidi and I sorted off a couple weeks ago. We will be turning rams in the first week in December onto both groups. We will be using some crossbred rams along with our own. This will be the first use of outside sourced rams since 2006, so I hope we will see some benefits. Time will tell.\n        \n    \nLast month, we had two groups of Blackhawk East students from Dan Hoge\'s ag classes come out for a tour of the pastures and livestock. It\'s always a thrill to see young people with an interest in animal agriculture. I\'ve never been more optimistic about the opportunities ahead when they can get away from the commodity environment and take advantage of the growing niche markets that are available to them, whether it be grass finishing lamb and beef as we do or raising pasture goats, hogs, poultry, both layers and broilers or all of the above.With two hayracks full of students surrounded by the ewes in the pasture, it was interesting to me that Dan told his students to listen to the sheep. He then said, after being around the ewes for 10 minutes, that he hadn\'t heard a single cough. It dawned on me then what I have been taking for granted.\n        \n    \nRuth and I traveled to Jefferson City, Mo., for another grazing conference last week, and it was great. While most conferences focus mainly on cattle, there were three speakers touting the merits of grazing commercial-scale lambs and goats. I was almost tempted to jump back in to the goat business, but I think the fever ran its course and I\'m over it now. Another bonus to our trip was getting a new pup. Ruth has been searching for an Australian Shepherd pup ever since we had to put our 14-year-old Maggie down last June. She, Rosie, has found a home here for sure.While we were on our way there, we started getting calls for lambs and have been pretty busy since with customers preparing for the upcoming four-day holiday of Thanksgiving. We had just received approval on our state-inspected slaughter facility back in late August prior to another holiday market, but not much activity after that time until the last week or so.Commodity price for lamb now is in the doldrums, especially those over 80 pounds, so I\'m glad we are able to sell them here at the farm. It may be a tradition to eat turkey on Thanksgiving, but it\'s never too late to start another tradition with lamb. Why wait until Easter? I hope you all enjoy and appreciate what we have to celebrate this Thanksgiving season.

Join The Roar from 5:35pm (AEDT) for live scores and commentary. \nIt was a season-defining win last time out for the Glory, coming from behind in glorious fashion to topple an in-form Melbourne Victory outfit. Late goals from super-sub Nebojsa Marinkovic and Adam Taggart sealed the three points for the Glory, who are now unbeaten in their last five matches. \nPerth\'s new year resurgence has seen the club climb into the top six. However, with the Wellington Phoenix and the Western Sydney Wanderers only three points behind, the Glory must not let their guard down, especially given they have only managed just one win away from home. \nMeanwhile, it was a familiar tale last week for Central Coast, who narrowly went down to Melbourne City after Roy O\'Donovan\'s sending off shifted the course of the match in the favour of the home side.\nDespite sitting at the bottom of the table, the Mariners have shown glimpses of improvement recently, highlighted by their incredible match with league leaders Sydney FC which they lost closely after rectifying a two-goal deficit.\nA win today could potentially see them jump ahead of Adelaide United and away from last on the ladder.\nThe last time these two sides met was back in November, when the Mariners notched up their second win of the season. Perth has only managed to beat the Mariners once at Bluetongue Stadium, back in November, 2014. Yet the Glory will be determined to improve their disappointing away record this season.\nO\'Donovan\'s absence through suspension is a big blow for the home side, having scored eight of the Mariners\' 18 goals this season. It comes as a stroke of luck for the Glory, who have suffered problems in defence this season, having conceded 31 goals after 16 rounds - the second highest in the league. \nYet, it\'s the Mariners who have conceded the most goals, letting 34 slip past. They will have to be extra cautious given the options the Glory has at its disposal. \nPredictionThe Mariners have shown a lot of spirit recently, however they will need a lot more than that to overcome an in-form Perth Glory side looking to extend its unbeaten run to six matches.\nPerth 3-1.\nJoin The Roar from 5:35pm (AEDT) for live scores and commentary.\n\n                \n\n				References^ REFRESH NOW (news.google.com)^ » Click here to read the full match report (www.theroar.com.au)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEbYxpbHAjqsenpiwVZxyoJdVbPYA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779361095237&ei=UpeNWI6YBcalW5_KsfAG&url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2017/01/28/central-coast-mariners-vs-perth-glory-league-live-scores-blog-2/,EN,,29/01/2017 08:05,2017-01-28 09:50:18+00:00,63c561e635,The Roar,,,,,1485600618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1a90e5185d,UTMB researchers face another animal rights complaint - Chron.com,"UTMB researchers face another animal rights complaint\n\n\n        \n\n\nGALVESTON - An animal rights group has filed a complaint alleging violations of the Animal Welfare Act by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.\nStop Animal Exploitation Now! filed a complaint  with the U.S. Department of Agriculture alleging that UTMB researchers mixed up tags on sheep, causing a procedure to be done on the wrong sheep and invalidating the research. The alleged mistake violated the U.S. Animal Welfare Act, the animal rights group said.\nUTMB questioned the accuracy of the claim, saying no surgeries were performed on sheep as alleged. \""We are not going to comment until they clarify or retract this news release because it\'s not accurate,\"" UTMB spokesman Raul Reyes said.\nThe complaint seeks the maximum fine of $10,000 for every violation of the Animal Welfare Act because UTMB is currently under investigation by the USDA for allegedly allowing monkeys to die painful deaths.\nThe alleged mistreatment was revealed in an audit last year that accused researchers of botching research by using improper standards.\nMichael Budkie, executive director of Stop Animal Exploitation Now!, conceded that the procedures performed on the sheep may not have been surgeries, as stated in the group\'s news release, but stands by its claim that the procedures had been performed on the wrong sheep.\n\""Whether it was a surgical procedure or an invasive procedure is not really relevant,\"" Budkie said.\nThe animal right group sent letters to the University of Texas vice chancellor for research and development, Patricia Hurn, to investigate UTMB researchers for allegedly bungling its research. The group also asked the executive editor of the Journal of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science to investigate  the veracity of an article it published based on the research.\n \n ",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFjoQhNFUD_xUT5pnfKWHLPspgZlw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=a2VaV6D0N-2-zAbR5qXABg&url=http://www.chron.com/neighborhood/bayarea/article/Animal-rights-group-files-another-complaint-7973999.php,EN,,10/06/2016 07:07,2016-06-09 21:21:39+00:00,7903d30a98,Chron.com,,,,,1465514499,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1c0966bc64,Serotonin may prevent milk fever - The Australian Dairyfarmer,"Serotonin may prevent milk fever in dairy cows: new research - Magazine - Livestock - Herd Health\n\n\n                Daily infusions with a chemical commonly associated with feelings of happiness were shown to increase calcium levels in the blood of Holstein cows and the milk of Jersey cows that had just given birth. The results, published in the Journal of Endocrinology, could lead to a better understanding of how to prevent milk fever (hypocalcaemia) in cows. Hypocalcaemia is considered a major health problem for cows. It is associated with immunological and digestive problems, decreased pregnancy rates and longer intervals between pregnancies.  Whilst there has been research into the treatment of hypocalcaemia, little research has focused on prevention.  In rodents it has been shown that serotonin (a naturally occurring chemical commonly associated with feelings of happiness) plays a role in maintaining calcium levels. Based on this, a team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, led by Dr Laura Hernandez, investigated the potential for serotonin to increase calcium levels in both the milk and blood of dairy cows.  The team infused a chemical that converts to serotonin into 24 dairy cows in the lead up to them giving birth. Half the cows were Jersey and half were Holstein. Calcium levels in both the milk and circulating blood were measured throughout the experiment. Whilst serotonin improved the overall calcium status in both breeds, this was brought about in opposite ways.  Treated Holstein cows had higher levels of calcium in their blood, but lower calcium in their milk (compared with controls). The reverse was true in treated Jersey cows and the higher milk calcium levels were particularly obvious in Jerseys at day 30 of lactation - suggesting a role for serotonin in maintaining levels throughout lactation. \""By studying two breeds we were able to see that regulation of calcium levels is different between the two,\"" Ms Hernandez said.  \""Serotonin raised blood calcium in the Holsteins, and milk calcium in the Jerseys. We should also note that serotonin treatment had no effect on milk yield, feed intake or on levels of hormones required for lactation.\"" The next steps are to investigate the molecular mechanism by which serotonin regulates calcium levels, and how this varies between breeds. \""We would also like to work on the possibility of using serotonin as a preventative measure for hypocalcaemia in dairy cows,\"" Ms Hernandez said.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFai_eCSD_YsV8dskhNAdE1v5Ah9Q&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779159188965&ei=StuJV9i-J4-vzAaT2ZPwDA&url=http://adf.farmonline.com.au/news/magazine/livestock/herd-health/serotonin-may-prevent-milk-fever/2753245.aspx,EN,,16/07/2016 07:12,2016-07-15 05:33:24+00:00,e0a6a790e1,The Australian Dairyfarmer,,,,,1468568004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1c282d3f30,"Past Political, Climatic Changes Challenged Chinese Horses - TheHorse.com","Past Political, Climatic Changes Challenged Chinese Horses\n\n\n			\n				Horses fared better than other livestock, both because of their adaptability and their military usefulness\n					Photo: iStock\n			\n		\r\n	When the political scene gets rough, society can suffer. When the climate gets rough, populations can suffer. When both politics and climate become simultaneously unfavorable, though, they can wreak havoc on essentially everyone-including horses.\n\r\n	Recent historical analysis of combined political and climatic challenges in 20th century China shows that the duo is devastating for horses and other livestock. And history could repeat itself, said Ang Li, PhD, researcher in the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Botany, in Beijing.\n\r\n	\""The environmental history of modern China is very important for our future,\"" Li said. \""We wanted to apply this knowledge in favor of the public and the nation.\""\n\r\n	Li said Inner Mongolia became an area of extreme political unrest in the 1960s and 1970s. Nestled between greater China and the communist Soviet Union, it endured the tense struggles of socialist revolution. This led to four main subperiods of social movement: the socialist education movement period (1964-1965), the most chaotic anarchy period (1966-1969), the military controlling period (1970-1976), and the standstill period (1977-1978).\n\r\n	At the same time, Mongolia falls in a geographic area of extreme climatic challenges, including severe droughts in summer and extreme blizzards in winter.\n\r\n	Li and colleagues analyzed data on political situations, climate, and livestock population demographics (horses, cattle, camels, sheep, and goats) from 1961 to 1986 in Inner Mongolia. This time frame included years of political unrest as well as peace.\n\r\n	They found that climatic hazards resulted in a rise in deaths of both adult and young horses and a drop in the number of births, Li said. But when political unrest was compounded with the climatic problems, those effects became more pronounced.\n\r\n	That was mostly related to the fact that the political environment prevented people from managing their herds in ways that had been practiced for years to deal with bad climate. \""In the peaceful period, herders relied on many useful traditional ecological experiences to resist the climate hazards, such as keeping the mobility of livestock, raising high ratios of adult animals, adjusting pregnancy rates, and culling certain weak neonatal individuals during hazard years,\"" the researchers stated in their report. \""These traditional strategies and practices provided the optimal way to survive in the harsh and unpredictable environment.\""\n\r\n	They also went to local leaders for production and management advice based on current climatic conditions, they added.\n\r\n	However, these options disappeared in times of political unrest, when new leaders forced management decisions that were inappropriate for that climate. \""Outsider revolutionaries had made many arrogant policies in livestock husbandry, and management leaders used some modern methods to replace the traditional practice of local herding,\"" the researchers stated. \""These livestock practices included improving pregnancy rate, improving the proportion of young individuals, etc. Although they were economically efficient for modern livestock husbandry, they were impractical in the nomadic periods.\""\n\r\n	Essentially, political decisions caused greater \""vulnerability,\"" the research team said. \""We suggested that such interactions intensified livestock vulnerability to climate hazards.\""\n\r\n	Even so, horses fared better than other livestock, both because of their adaptability and their military usefulness, Li said. \""Mongolian horses are stronger than sheep and goat in the cold periods,\"" he said. \""They can find forage in ice-locked pastures. But also, during the threat of the Soviet Union, horses were put at high priority in order to meet the demands of the national defense. China was poor and weak at that time, and mounted cavalry was better than infantry in the grasslands.\""\n\r\n	The study, \""Political Pressures Increased Vulnerability to Climate Hazards for Nomadic Livestock in Inner Mongolia, China[1],\"" was published in Scientific Reports. \n\n	\n		About the Author\n			\n				\n		Christa Lesté-Lasserre, MA[2]\n		Christa Lesté-Lasserre is a freelance writer based in France.

1c4b221c69,Professor trampled to death by cattle in East Sussex - The Guardian,"Professor trampled to death by cattle in East Sussex | UK news\n\n\nA former Oxford academic whose invention made him an overnight millionaire has been trampled to death by a herd of cows.\nBrian Bellhouse, 80, was killed by the animals while walking alone in a field in Guestling, near Hastings in East Sussex, on Monday.\nThe alarm was raised by another walker after his screams were heard. It is thought that the cattle became agitated and charged at him. Paramedics administered CPR and an air ambulance attended, but Bellhouse was pronounced dead at the scene.\nHe lived about five miles away in Winchelsea and it was not clear why he was walking in the field.\nPolice said the death of the former Magdalen College academic was not suspicious and details have been passed to the coroner.\nA Sussex police spokesman said: \""An 80-year-old man died after being found trampled in a field of cattle at Church Lane, Guestling, on Monday.\n\""Police and paramedics performed CPR after being called at 11.02am and an air ambulance landed at the scene, but he was sadly pronounced dead at 11.46am.\n\""There are no suspicious circumstances and the matter has been passed to the coroner\'s officer.\""\nA spokesman for Magdalen College confirmed the death of Prof Bellhouse.\nHe began a degree in mathematics in 1957 and obtained his DPhil in engineering science in 1964 and became an official fellow in engineering science two years later. \n\""Brian co-founded the company PowderJect in 1993, which became one of the first companies to be spun-out successfully from the University of Oxford and was based at our Oxford Science Park,\"" the college spokesman said.\n\""Brian was a major donor to the College and endowed the Oxford-Bellhouse graduate scholarship at Magdalen in biomedical engineering.\"" \nHe became an emeritus fellow in 2004 after retiring from the university.\nThe academic devised a device that delivered needle-free injections. The company formed to commercialise the invention floated on the London stock exchange in 1997 and six years later was sold to US pharmaceuticals group Chiron for £542m.\nThe sale triggered a £100m windfall for Bellhouse, his son-in-law Paul Drayson - PowerJect\'s chief executive - and their families.\nDrayson, who put £250,000 into PowderJect when he joined the company in 1993, collected almost £43m from his 8% stake, while Bellhouse got £19.5m for his 3.6% stake. Their family trusts received a £41m payment.\nAlthough PowerJect initially focused on the needle-free injection technology, it later concentrated on making influenza vaccines, which attracted the takeover interest. \nA year after the sale PowderJect\'s former research chief, Clive Dix, raised £20m in venture capital to buy back the injection technology from Chiron.\nThere have been at least 74 deaths involving cattle in the UK since 2000.\nIn April last year 61-year-old Marian Clode was killed while walking with her husband, daughter and son-in-law along a public bridlepath in Belford, Northumberland. The party was approached by a herd of cattle, which included several calves.\nHer daughter Lucy Rowe told Sky News[1] that one cow \""flipped my mum like a rag doll over the fence into the next fence\"" after charging at her for the third time.\nReferences^ Her daughter Lucy Rowe told Sky News (news.sky.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHqdAa1a4ZdkCpoBn8OUZ86bZ0j1g&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779528834621&ei=Nr9MWcjPMcPmW7XOkJAH&url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/professor-trampled-to-death-by-cattle-in-east-sussex,EN,,23/06/2017 07:11,2017-06-13 21:10:01+00:00,c9593f6e51,The Guardian,,,,,1497395401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1ceef96e9e,Turkey season comes in Saturday - Indiana Gazette,"Turkey season comes in Saturday | Sports\n\n\r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                                On Saturday, spring gobbler season will open across the state with bearded birds being legal game for license holders.Hunters who plan to take part in the hunt should be sure to positively identify their target before even touching the trigger, much less squeezing it. Care should also be taken when loading and unloading the shotgun during the predawn, and then upon returning to the vehicle. Hunting accidents are preventable to a degree, and steps should be taken so only favorable memories are created this spring.The beautiful weather over the weekend kicked the vegetation in our area into high gear, and plants are now in various stages of growth. As the spring hunt progresses, the understory in select cut timber stands will explode in foliage and make it all but impossible to see a gobbler at 50 yards.For years, I have used a rangefinder while archery hunting, but after a couple Colorado rifle hunts, I now include the rangefinder in all hunts. Much like during archery, upon setting up to call, unique features such as downed logs, trees, boulders and clearings can be ranged so that upon the gobbler\'s arrival the hunter is confident in the shot.Since utilizing a rangefinder, I have set a personal best in distance between the end of my 10-gauge and a stone-dead turkey. In the same time I have not missed or wounded a gobbler and now view the rangefinder as essential as the box call.The excitement felt as a gobbler sounds off just out of sight is hard to describe, and even the best hunters can be rattled. Focusing on taking breaths prior to the shot and steadying the shotgun is easier said than done. However, any encounter with turkey in the spring woods is a blessing, and sometimes it takes a few hunts before the stars align.The variety of wildlife that one can encounter in the spring turkey woods is reason enough to plan a few hunts.Despite an unappetizing smell, wild turkey is excellent table fare, although older birds are best when slow-cooked.During warmer weather, the turkey should be field dressed, and an iced-down cooler is wise when hunting any distance from home.The weight of a plump jake over the shoulder is always satisfying when walking back to the truck, and they always seem to gain several pounds during the pack-out. I was never a fan of the fluorescent orange rule that has since been abandoned, but when carrying out a tagged bird, I expose an orange flap on my turkey vest. Better safe than sorry is my standard in the spring woods, and with any luck I will be able to hear the world come alive for many hunts to come.Patterning and cleaning your shotgun prior to the hunt is important as semi-automatics are prone to gather debris, which can slow the action and prevent cycling in some situations. Although the first shot should always count, having a couple extra rounds instantly available can stop a flopping bird from escaping or make good on an unexplainable miss. If young hunters do not practice pulling the trigger three times at the range, it seems foolish to expect them to empty a gun during the hunt.Hunters are able to purchase a second spring gobbler tag, although it must be done prior to the season opening. With a monthlong season, having an extra tag can allow more time afield with the chance of more meat in the freezer.If you are fortunate enough to harvest a turkey this spring, it is important to report your harvest so that the Pennsylvania Game Commission has real numbers to work with when evaluating the population._ Trout anglers are fortunate to have so many options as to where to fish, with streams being stocked daily. Information on stocking dates is readily available, although it can take a day or two at times before the fresh fish are willing to feed.Cummings Dam located in Blue Spruce County Park has been stocked with trout.The opportunities to enjoy the outdoors are almost endless during the spring, and one should take advantage of this special season before it turns to summer.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNG5xbJacvmcK7sqPh1tZpEXh681VQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779879427117&ei=7SngWpDFA5mczAa6r5bwDg&url=https://www.indianagazette.com/sports/turkey-season-comes-in-saturday/article_870bac40-47cc-11e8-96f9-b7027a6caaa8.html,EN,,25/04/2018 07:10,2018-04-24 13:08:33+00:00,ece86a9f0a,Indiana Gazette,,,,,1524582513,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dogs and cats are allowed in parks. But the idea of potbellied pigs as pets left some councilmembers perplexed.Several echoed the opinion that livestock shouldn\'t be pets.Residents do currently own potbellied pigs. It was decided at a prior meeting that Billings Animal Control would not enforce the ordinance in effect that bans pigs as pets in city limits until a decision was made by the council.The change in the ordinance would allow one potbellied pig per household not to exceed 125 pounds.They would be required to be spayed or neutered as well as be vaccinated.Pigs must wear a license, harness and leash in public.A few concerns raised by the council include future requests for livestock as pets and certain language in the ordinance.Councilmembers Larry Brewster and Dick Clark voiced opposition to the topic.Councilmember Ryan Sullivan opposed the ordinance, but suggested an application for residents to apply for specific \'specialty\' pets.Despite that, the council decided in a 6-5 straw poll that it will discuss the issue further at a June 19 meeting.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGzu6-41EC-PR2fxTKXD0Od_QdiUQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779432825337&ei=IdTUWLilJcX3zAaj-4ToDQ&url=http://www.ktvq.com/story/34958321/billings-city-council-lukewarm-on-allowing-potbellied-pigs-as-pets,EN,,24/03/2017 08:09,2017-03-21 00:31:00+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,KTVQ Billings News,,,,,1490059860,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s a bit tricky to see, however. The hotel\'s staff appears to have noticed-on Friday afternoon, the chutes were covered up by a photograph of the east façade of the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe Old Post Office, completed in 1899, enjoys extensive historic-preservation status, potentially making removal of the dead avian tricker than simply opening up the wall and fishing it out. (Not that the Trump Organization always observed preservation rules during the renovations, some government officials have claimed.)[2]\nWashingtonian has asked the General Services Administration, which issued a 60-year lease on the Romanesque Revival landmark to the Trump Organization in 2012, for its guidance on making spot repairs like dead-bird removal.\n\nThe bird could also big a sign of something darker. According to the Audubon Society\'s list of bird-related superstitions, dead birds inside a structure are bad news: \""A bird that flies into a house foretells an important message. However, if the bird dies, or is white, this foretells death,\"" the organization warns[3].\n\nPerhaps it\'s no accident, then, that Washington\'s event planners are skittish[4] about taking their business to the Trump International Hotel.\n\n		\n		\n			\n\n		\n		\n	References^ promote its opening (www.washingtonian.com)^ during the renovations (www.buzzfeed.com)^ the organization warns (ca.audubon.org)^ are skittish (www.washingtonian.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEZmSlFv4NF-B3Cwg4-icHXU7Y2UA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779212639002&ei=J-fcV9iAEoGQWMXIivAD&url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/09/16/there-is-a-dead-bird-stuck-in-a-chute-at-trumps-dc-hotel/,EN,,17/09/2016 07:11,2016-09-16 18:48:01+00:00,ece86a9f0a,Washingtonian.com,,,,,1474058881,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1ffd4ff79e,New honour for talented young artist Will Hazzard - Western Advocate,"New honour for talented young artist Will Hazzard\n\nA BIG 2018 is continuing for talented Meadow Flat artist Will Hazzard.After winning the Bathurst Arts Council Youth Arts Award at the Australia Day celebrations in January and being named a finalist in the arts and fashion category in the NSW/ACT Young Achiever Awards, Will was given a new honour recently.He was chosen to address the official opening of Operation Art at the Art Gallery of NSW after last year winning the ANSTO (Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation) senior award in the statewide competition.Operation Art invites students from across the state to create works of art and the best are selected for display to brighten the lives of children in hospital.This is the 20th year that the winning works have been exhibited at the Art Gallery of NSW. Speaking at the Art Gallery of NSW opening, Will said he became aware of the initiative when he saw the touring exhibition at Western Plains Cultural Centre in Dubbo in December 2015.\""I thought the idea of creating art that would end up in hospitals to cheer up sick children was a wonderful thing,\"" he told the winners and guests.\""I was determined to be involved.\""His inspiration came a month later when he saw a blue-tongue lizard giving birth to babies in his front garden.Not only did his painting win a prize in Operation Art, but it was chosen by the Department of Education Arts Unit as the motif for T-shirts and other material used in statewide musical festivals.Will\'s 2017 entry of a Bathurst copper butterfly was also selected in the Touring 50.Next month, he will unveil his solo exhibition Share The Earth in Dubbo.\""Winning Operation Art has helped me grow and continue to achieve and help others,\"" Will told the opening.\""I am very happy that people like my work.\""Will studies through the Dubbo School of Distance Education.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHY1zXP22HSVk9TIS4VN2gd8OAWOg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779852069129&ei=rSfDWrDqAYrIWMndhPAJ&url=http://www.westernadvocate.com.au/story/5305609/new-honour-for-talented-young-artist-will-hazzard/,EN,,03/04/2018 07:02,2018-04-01 06:08:28+00:00,7e768e403e,Western Advocate,,,,,1522570108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

23acb0dfe8,"Dead Goose Falls From Sky, Sends Waterfowl Hunter To Shock ... - CBS Baltimore / WJZ","Dead Goose Falls From Sky, Sends Waterfowl Hunter To Shock Trauma « CBS Baltimore\n\n\n				BALTIMORE (WJZ) - An experienced hunter is recovering after a goose that was shot and killed fell from the sky and hit the man in Easton, Maryland.\nThe waterfowl hunter found himself in the crosshairs of his harvest on Thursday - knocked out cold by a dead goose falling from the sky.\n\""These birds weigh anywhere from 10 to probably 14 pounds. They can have a wingspan of up to six feet,\"" says Candy Thomson, Maryland Natural Resources Police. \""So, if they\'re 35 yards up in the air,  and they\'re falling 60 feet and they hit you in the head, it\'s going to definitely cause severe damage.\""\nMaryland Natural Resources Police say the unpredictable scene played out near the Miles River.\nA group of hunters had leased private land and took their shots at a flock of geese before sunset.

24b6d612e3,Silence on local sheep deaths gives Chester\'s ?insight? on live exports rhetoric - North Queensland Register,"Silence of the sheep gives Chester\'s live exports \""insight\""\n\n Labor MP Lisa Chesters.BENDIGO Labor MP Lisa Chesters says she knows the difference between \""keyboard warriors\"" bombarding her political office with emails, demanding an end to Australia\'s live animal export trade and genuine policy considerations.Ms Chesters was appointed Shadow Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Australia after last year\'s federal election and has been an active member of the ALP\'s country caucus since first entering parliament in 2013.She says she isn\'t against live exports, so long as the industry doesn\'t send Australian jobs off-shore and maintains strict animal welfare standards, according to community expectations.The Victorian regional MP also has a strong union background in tackling work force issues which has seen Opposition Leader Bill Shorten give her another role as the Shadow Assistant Minster for Workplace Relations.Ms Chesters has pledged to keep a close watch on potential gouging of local employment in the meat processing sector, through unchecked expansion of the live animal export trade.But she said she also understands how the modern world of social media activism can play a negative role in communicating policy issues to political representatives and the broader community.Ms Chesters referred to a recent occasion where MPs were being \""bombarded\"" with emails demanding the live exports industry be shut down, following an incident involving \""shocking\"" mistreatment of Australian sheep being transported to Kuwait,.But she said at the same time her local newspaper - the Bendigo Advertiser - ran a \""shocking\"" front page story about local sheep suffering a \""horrible death\"" from heat exhaustion and being dumped at the Bendigo saleyards.Ms Chesters said the issue showed that transport conditions can be \""just as dangerous and torturous\"" for local live-stock, as it can be for animals exported live from Australia to another country overseas.\""I received no emails about the sheep that were dumped, the dead carcasses, at the Bendigo saleyards, but my email was bombarded by what was happening in a third world country,\"" she said.\""It kind of says to me, \'Hang on a minute; sometimes the keyboard warriors are more focussed on what\'s happening overseas as opposed to what\'s happening in our own country\'.\""That gave me an insight to say, \'let\'s just step back a bit and think through the logical steps and make sure all of the checks and accountability is there and let\'s make sure that the system, that\'s been set up to ensure safeguards, is being properly followed.\""Ms Chesters said a lot of the rhetoric must be removed from the live exports \""debate\"" to allow MP\'s to take informed positions on the industry.\""These are things you learn once you start to engage with the agricultural sector,\"" she said.\""Live exports is an area that we do need to continue looking at the policy and how its impacting.\""It\'s about 9 per cent of our export industry and that\'s something that took me by surprise, when you start to talk to the sheep-meat industry and live cattle exporters.\""I\'m not sure whether the rest of Australia or people living in Melbourne or Sydney know that it\'s only about 9pc of what we actually export, in terms of sheep and livestock.\""Ms Chesters said ongoing scrutiny was needed to oversee the growing trend of live cattle being shipped into third world countries like Cambodia to be processed and the beef then on-sold into markets like Korea, China and Japan, under the Australian beef label.She said that was a growing area of the live exports sector where \""essentially what\'s being exported are the meat processing jobs\"".Ms Chesters said one of her core concerns about Australia\'s free trade deals with China, Japan and Korea was the need to ensure local employment was protected.\""The big jobs boost for agriculture is in the value adding - it is in the processing side of things,\"" she said.\""But what appears to be happening at the moment is that we\'re creating jobs in countries like Cambodia where it\'s cheaper to process than Australia so we\'ve got to watch that.\""Ms Chesters said live exports was \""a tricky issue for Labor\"" and one that carried \""a lot of emotion\"".\""We need to ensure we always have animal welfare foremost and we have best practice,\"" she said.\""What Labor has learned, and this was of course before I was in parliament, is that the industry needs stability and it needs continuous engagement to make sure that you don\'t just overnight shut down an industry.\""I think Labor has learned from that experience and we need to work with industry to ensure best practice.\""Ms Chesters said she was also learning that live animal exports in Victoria was \""very different\"" to live animal exports in the NT or other states like WA and Queensland and the economic values needed to be broken down and considered.\""When I talk to my Labor colleague Warren Snowden in the NT, he says the cattle in the NT are not suitable for Australian markets and so it\'s to a point where they then send cattle to Indonesia to be fattened and sold at market,\"" he said.\""That\'s very different to what\'s happening in Victoria where literally, carcasses that would be processed at Hardwicks and Kyneton are being sold and live exported out of Victoria.\""And that\'s where you ask, \'Is that a bit of a policy failure where we\'re starting to see a downturn in jobs for foods processing in Victoria because sheep and cattle are being exported live that would otherwise have been processed here?\'\""We know the jobs are in the supply chain so the government needs to be doing whatever it can to lock in those supply chain jobs.\""But I don\'t believe this government is interested in supply chain jobs and the only thing (Agriculture and Water Resources Minister) Barnaby Joyce ever talks about is farm-gate prices; he doesn\'t talk about supply chain jobs and that\'s disappointing.\""The story Silence of the sheep gives Chester\'s live exports \""insight\""[1] first appeared on Farm Online[2].References^ Silence of the sheep gives Chester\'s live exports \""insight\"" (www.farmonline.com.au)^ Farm Online (www.farmonline.com.au)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNF-c0iqQ2Q5ZM2OxHToDrbQqVaoNQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=LYyRWPDyE4OoW9mBi9AO&url=http://www.northqueenslandregister.com.au/story/4440398/silence-on-local-sheep-deaths-gives-chesters-insight-on-live-exports-rhetoric/?cs%3D4735,EN,,01/02/2017 08:07,2017-02-01 04:14:23+00:00,7903d30a98,North Queensland Register,,,,,1485926063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No way!\""The scene was reminiscent of something shot by Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin.[1]Aussie favourite Steve, who died in 2006 when a stingray struck him in the heart, would often make incredible animal discoveries in the Australian outback.Some of the fishermen on board the boat with Andy can be heard on camera saying: \""This is what you get when you\'re a wild man.\""He\'s only just eaten it - isn\'t that incredible.\""After pulling the snake from the cod\'s stomach both creatures were released back into the water.Andy said he recognised the animal as a spotted black snake, one of the most venomous in Australia.\""I\'ve been fishing since I was six years old and fishing in Northern Australian waters since 1999 and I have never seen anything like this before,\"" he said.References^ Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin.

2c0264d36c,"Historic dispute: School district, preservationists at odds over Chesco barn - Philly.com","Historic dispute: School district, preservationists at odds over Chesco barn\n\nDistrict officials plan to preserve the older and more structurally stable 18th-century farmhouse. They want to leave as green space the 18 acres that cannot be built upon because of an environmentally protected creek; the barn and farmhouse are on that acreage.But last month, the district applied to Schuylkill Township officials for a permit to demolish the barn, which needs repairs to its foundation.School officials said it should be torn down because its instability could be a liability and the district would need to pay to remove engine oil found in surrounding soil. The Schuylkill Historical Commission is trying to save the barn, which its members say is a symbol of the unique heritage of Pennsylvania, a heritage preservationists say is being eroded by development.\""Barns are important, because they are the most tangible connection to our agrarian past and they symbolize not only craftsmanship but farmers\' dedication to their land,\"" said Jeffrey Marshall, a board member of the National Barn Alliance and the Historic Barn and Farm Foundation of Pennsylvania.Although no accurate statistics are available on the number of historic barns in the country, the structures are going fast, preservationists say, as farms are replaced by housing developments.The farmstead in Schuylkill Township - barn, farmhouse, and springhouse - is on the National Register of Historic Places.\""If you take away the barn, you\'ve taken away the idea of a farmstead,\"" said Sandy Momyer, chair of the Schuylkill Historical Commission. \""We think it would be important to take the time now and analyze all the information and not just go to demolition.\""School officials said they are open to preserving the barn if feasible. At a meeting on Tuesday, a school district committee plans to consider the cost of strengthening the foundation and insuring the building and will decide whether to go forward with plans for demolition.If so, the township Board of Supervisors is scheduled Sept. 7 to decide whether to grant the permit.Local historians say the barn and the rest of the farmstead can be a tangible tool to help students learn about history, just as school officials say the nearby creek can be a tool for biology students.District officials said the farmhouse has more historical significance and more potential for alternate use than the barn.\""We really do look forward to working with the historical commission and Schuylkill Township on ways to repurpose and thoughtfully use the farmhouse,\"" said Alan Fegley, the district\'s superintendent.Construction of the new roughly 150,000-square-foot building, which will house two schools, started last September. The Phoenixville Area Early Learning Center and Manavon Elementary School, named for the small village from which Phoenixville evolved, will replace the Kindergarten Center and East Pikeland Elementary when they open for the 2017-18 school year.The project, budgeted to cost more than $70 million, also will include two baseball fields, two softball fields, and two multipurpose fields.School officials, who paid $4.75 million for the property, said its size and location next to the middle and high schools made it ideal for the project.mbond@philly.com[1]610-313-8207@MichaelleBondReferences^ mbond@philly.com (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGpi2umDoLzaNEvCvolls2ZAPTIfw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779188499112&ei=zbbPV8DDKKiIzAaRoqngBQ&url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20160825_Historic_dispute__School_district__preservationists_at_odds_over_Chesco_barn.html,EN,,07/09/2016 07:04,2016-08-24 21:18:03+00:00,5b41d61294,Philly.com,,,,,1472080683,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2db65f469a,"\'A piece of Fargo history\': Site of former abortion clinic, major ... - INFORUM","\'A piece of Fargo history\': Site of former abortion clinic, major protests, to be demolished\n\nFARGO-The old two-story off Main Avenue here looks like any house in need of fixing, with its peeling paint, patched up siding and overgrown trees.Upon closer examination, traces of a more complex, even turbulent history become evident.Long-faded warning signs of \""private property\"" and \""premises under surveillance\"" remain.On the backside, repairs are still visible from the time someone used a molotov cocktail to set the building on fire.The structure at 11 14th St. S. was home to North Dakota\'s first abortion clinic, the Fargo Women\'s Health Organization, from 1981 to 2001.Through the years, it was the target of break-ins, fire-bombings and contentious protests that tested law enforcement in ways they hadn\'t been before.Retired Fargo Police Officer Pat Claus said it reminds him of how police dealt with Vietnam War protests in the late 1960s.\""The crazy mob mentality, and you had that thin blue line you were trying to walk,\"" Claus said. \""It became even thinner, trying to protect everybody.\""The backdrop for those tumultuous times, however, will soon be history.The house, built in 1908, has been sold to a next-door property owner, who will demolish it to make way for parking.Eric Hansen, 32, and his father, Keith Hansen, who lived in the house for the past dozen or so years, decided to sell after growing tired of the ongoing repairs.Though too young to remember the old clinic himself, Hansen recognizes its place in history.\""It seems like everybody knows about this place, you know. They all have their own stories about it,\"" he said.Wild protestsWith a background in abortion rights, Jane Bovard helped start the Fargo Women\'s Health Organization in October 1981.Now 75, she remembers the struggle of finding the space to begin with.\""Once they knew it would be an abortion clinic? Nope, they weren\'t going to rent to us,\"" Bovard said recently from her home in Stillwater, Minn.She dealt with sporadic protests and court battles in the early years, but nothing like what happened in March 1991.About two dozen abortion protesters broke into the clinic before it opened for the day and linked themselves together at the neck with Kryptonite bike locks.Two months later, members of the Lambs of Christ traveled from all over the country to Fargo to take protests to a new level.They used a variety of means and materials to try to disrupt clinic operations, from putting junked cars in the driveway to locking their hands and feet in metal boxes inside the clinic.The protests were so wild that the CBS newsmagazine, \""60 Minutes,\"" then the No. 1 show on television, devoted their Sunday report to the protests in Fargo.Bovard hired Tammi Kromenaker to work at the clinic, just before one of the major protests.\""I started the next week and Jane said, \'I didn\'t know if you were even going to show up after that incident,\'\"" said Kromenaker, director of Fargo\'s only abortion facility now, Red River Women\'s Clinic.Lambs made their markWhen officers arrested the Lambs, the protesters refused to walk or give their names to symbolize the plight of the unborn.Kim Claus, retired Fargo PD like her husband Pat, was a new officer at the time, still in training.She gave each arrestee a number and snapped their photo before they were loaded onto city buses and taken to jail.\""We even had a nun with one arm. How do you handcuff her?\"" Claus said.Martin Wishnatsky had traveled with the Lambs from New York to Fargo to protest.Now 73 and working for a conservative Christian nonprofit in Alabama, he didn\'t intend to stay but ended up living in Fargo for 18 years.\""Kind of like a soldier that went to war and stayed in the country he fought in,\"" Wishnatsky said.While not a member of the Lambs, Adele Brennan of Fargo also protested abortion at the site then, just as she does now at the downtown Red River Women\'s Clinic.She said she\'s glad the old clinic site is going away.\""It\'s gotten to be in very bad shape physically, slowly. It\'d be nice if this one would go too,\"" Brennan said with a laugh, referring to the newer facility downtown.Building firebombedPerhaps the most frightening incident for people who worked at the old WHO clinic was when it was firebombed in April 1992.The fire was started in the early morning hours and discovered by a security guard, but not before it heavily charred the rear of the building.Bovard tried to put any potential dangers of her work out of her mind.\""It\'s more scary looking back on it now than when I was living it,\"" she said.She and Kromenaker decided to leave Fargo WHO in 1997, after the clinic was sold and the building fell into disrepair.Bovard and abortion doctor George Miks then opened Red River Women\'s Clinic in 1998, giving Fargo a second facility offering abortions for a time.In 2001, Fargo WHO closed, citing financial reasons, leaving Fargo again with one abortion provider.Demolition aheadInside the front door of the old house off Main, the clinic\'s sign remains overhead with \""North Dakota Women\'s Health Organization, Inc.\"" in white letters on a black background.Intercom and security systems, long defunct, are still in place.On the main floor, sinks have been removed from the former exam and procedure rooms.On the second floor, the former waiting area for patients was turned into a bedroom by its current owner, its walls painted neon pink.In a nearby bathroom, an opening through which to pass urine samples to the clinic\'s former lab remains, though it\'s long been nailed shut.Hansen has moved out his belongings and once the house goes through a final inspection, it will be torn down as early as the first week of May.Wishnatsky wants a plaque put on the site, he said, \""to remember the children who died there.\""Kromenaker isn\'t sad about the demolition, but it does make her reflect on her patients and the building\'s past.\""I think it\'s a piece of Fargo history,\"" she said.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGebuISit0RjvDgNhuh6nPB2ZCwIg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779886497589&ei=ObXqWqCwJIfTzQbnkYQw&url=https://www.inforum.com/news/4438741-piece-fargo-history-site-former-abortion-clinic-major-protests-be-demolished,EN,,03/05/2018 07:07,2018-04-30 12:09:19+00:00,95c728a7b8,INFORUM,,,,,1525097359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2e83526057,The Selfie As We Know It Is Dead - WIRED,"The Selfie as We Know It Is Dead\n\nAn exhibit from The Museum of Selfies, currently on view in Glendale, California.Tiffany RoseThe duck face, the fish gape, the smize-these are just a few of the time-honored poses that celebrities, influencers, and the Instagram-happy masses have relied upon to create perfect selfies. But a lot has changed since the early aughts, when people first started training their smartphone lenses on themselves. Today, selfie-takers can achieve poreless, doll-like symmetry through feature enhancing apps like FaceTune, or they can hire on-demand photographers through ElsiePic to capture their adventures for them so they can remain \""in the moment.\""But is a selfie still a selfie if someone else is taking it for you? Is intimacy lost when your look is digitally modified, or is that just better living through technology? Somehow paying a photographer to art direct your life feels antithetical to the spontaneity that was once associated with #iwokeuplikethis or even the much-maligned bathroom mirror pic. Could it be the selfie has come to an end? Kim Kardashian West seems to think so. Yes, the woman who once released a coffee table book of selfies, has concluded that, in her professional opinion, the trend is basically over. Data from Google Trends has also shown a steady decline in the keyword since it was added to the dictionary in 2013.Want further proof that the selfie is a thing of the past? The artform, like so many relics of antiquity, is now in a museum. The Museum of Selfies, currently on view in Glendale, California, is an interactive exhibit documenting the rise of the selfie and perhaps its ultimate demise. But Tommy Honton, co-curator of the museum, thinks that despite Kardashian West\'s proclamation, the selfie is still alive and well. \""Selfies are just another form of self-portraiture, so saying the selfie dead is like saying the era of photography is over,\"" Honton says. And his exhibit is proof of that, inviting visitors to look beyond the assumption that the selfie is a symbol of narcissism and instead see it as a form of artistic expression.Cultural critic Negar Mottahedeh takes it a step further, saying that even more than a bit of digital vanity, the selfie is \""a networked object that connects us with others beyond our physical environment through an online collective.\"" She should know; Mottahedeh teaches a class on the subject at Duke University that focuses on the global history of portraiture since the 19th century as well as our desire to document the ordinary. And in addition to making a record of the everyday, she notes the selfie has played an integral role in citizen journalism during events like the 2009 elections in Iran and the protests that gave rise to the Arab Spring.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to EmojiMottahedeh, who is also a member of the Selfie Research Network, explains that as corporate influence weakens social media\'s capacity to create networks of resistance or solidarity amongst people, its power as a useful tool for popular politics is diminished. For her, that means the power of the selfie is dwindling too. \""In the early days of the selfie it appeared as if two forms of representation were being democratized, that of the portrait and that of the proxy. I don\'t find that it carries that possibility anymore,\"" Mottahedeh says. She hopes that Facebook\'s Cambridge Analytica scandal will bring attention to the forces behind our newsfeeds. \""We need to be very aware that each click, like, and comment we make is a signal to those in power, be it corporate or governmental,\"" she explains.Mottahedeh sees the younger generation embracing meme culture as the political intervention of the moment, recontextualizing politics through viral images and bringing them into the real world through the protest posters of marches and demonstrations. Conversely, those images are photographed by citizen journalists and then redistributed across social media platforms.This is where Honton believes the selfie still has value, that it\'s still the most accessible way to capture the immediacy and intimacy of the individual\'s everyday experience. The goal of his temporary museum, which runs through May, is not only to include the selfie in the history of photography, but to subvert the idea that we\'re just living life through the interface of our phones. \""Selfies are powerful because they let us author our own stories,\"" Honton says. As for the future of digital self-portraiture, he believes the selfie will live on. For Honton, \""even when we\'re living as virtual avatars of ourselves a la Ready Player One, we\'re probably still going to want to take a selfie of that experience as our virtual selves.\""The selfie may be over, but it will never truly die.More WIRED CultureWhat does \""self-care\"" mean amid the barrage of news and social media?The strange history of one of the Internet\'s first viral videosWhere did the word \'doggo\' come from?

2f033f6fcd,"Of Course Louis CK Jokes About Suicide, Abortion & Race In His New Netflix Special - Complex","Of Course Louis CK Jokes About Suicide, Abortion & Race In His New Netflix Special\n\nIn his new Netflix special, 2017, Louis C.K.[1] does something he rarely does: wear a suit. The nicer duds don\'t accompany more presentable material-he\'s still talking about jizz, abortion and suicide. But the formal wear befits C.K.\'s status as an indisputable member of the modern humor pantheon. As Chris Rock tackles race and Jerry Seinfeld deconstructs mundanity, C.K. slaughters and grills our most sacred cows. \r\n \r\nIn his set that debuts today, C.K. characterizes suicidal thoughts as a universal human trait-our entire population is just those who woke up said, \""Ugh, fine. More, I guess.\"" He talks about Jeff, a dude who stole his eighth grade dance date then later became a transgender woman, transforming \""from an asshole to a cunt.\"" He recounts \""really liking\"" Matthew McConaughey\'s Magic Mike monologue where he coos, \""the law says you cannot touch, but I see a lot of lawbreakers...\"" Then, he admits that he might suck the world\'s most perfect dick.He deploys stereotypical voices, justifying the offensive cliché by saying that stereotypes aren\'t funny, but the voices still are. And he proves it by doing a hacky impression of a black dude, then saying he\'s \""Chineser than a muthafucka,\"" flipping our sensitivity against us and removing the offensive meaning behind a triggering impression.He filmed the special in Washington D.C. a few days before Donald Trump was inaugurated. But he doesn\'t delve into any partisan bits, save from speculating about survivors stumbling upon his special in a rubble-laden wasteland. Rather, in his distinctly crass fashion, he rolls out observations that strive to be universally understandable. For example, he guides viewers to process that abortion clinic protestors sincerely believe that doctors are \""killing babies.\"" After sitting with that for a moment, their sputtering zeal makes more sense, even if their strategy and worldview still seem cruel and naive.So although there\'s never been a time when awful shit wasn\'t going down, comedy seems particularly valuable now, especially comedy that taps into touchy subjects, because nothing neutralizes divisiveness like looking over and seeing someone laughing at the same thing you are. It\'s C.K.\'s specialty-extracting laughs from that which we\'ve suppressed, from that which divides and scares us, from that which we\'ve always taken very seriously. C.K. transcends his individual works. He riffs on familiar themes, but he doesn\'t have anything like Jim Gaffigan\'s \""Hot Pocket[2]\"" bit.  He junks his material every year-a practice that\'s produced 10 specials over 11 years, a prolific consistency not matched by any of his contemporaries and exceeded only by George Carlin and Richard Pryor. So like a jam band, his aura and execution comprise his main appeal. We come not for any individual joke, but for his perspective. We look to him to sort out the reason and humor within subjects that usually result in senseless screaming matches. He\'s very good at his job and especially necessary now.59 percent[3] of Americans believe people are too easily offended. The buzzword for these people is \""snowflakes,\"" usually uttered dismissively by older, whiter people towards younger, darker people who most times have legitimate concerns over our nation\'s living history of what results from hateful language. But C.K. takes another path, going after the dominant groups that don\'t really have the justification for ruffled feathers-like the Christians who believe there\'s a War on Christmas. In his special, to prove that \""Christians have won,\"" C.K. asks what year it is? 2017. Counting from what? Exactly. He presents a wide-lens view of a seemingly contentious debate that\'s already been decided. It\'s a much-needed check against bluster that guides the discussion to a far saner starting point. Because ISIS\'s evil aside, they won\'t ever dominate so thoroughly that we restart over at zero. So chill, Christians. Similarly, his infatuation with McConaughey\'s monologue demystifies homosexuality. For the straight people that can\'t even bear to imagine those urges, hearing a father of two make this confession might make that sexual orientation seem a bit more natural. Even if it\'s not what they\'re into, he guides listeners to see how someone else might be. So chill, straight people.Or in Chewed Up, where he talks about being white[4], aiming at the significant percentage of white people who do not believe white privilege exists. In fact, 43 percent[5] of Americans, and 64 percent of Republicans, believe \""discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.\""  C.K. calmly dismantles this absurdity. He reframes the idea of race, imagining it\'s an option that you could \""re-up\"" every year, encouraging a moment of reflection for white people. So sure, occasionally being suspected of racism isn\'t fun, but it\'s a lot better than getting asked for papers, or delayed at airports or killed by the police for trivial matters-especially when, on average, white people have fared better by just about every metric[6] since this country\'s founding. So chill, white people.Allow me to be the millionth person to say: America is divided. Yet, gentle cajoles to ideological foes seem to have the impact of a custard pie dropped from a stepladder six feet high[7]. If bigots ever hatch from their nativist cocoon, the catalyst probably sounds a lot like C.K. He\'s politically incorrect, but with compassion. He bluntly reframes discussions, dropping our guard to help us think the things we have knee-jerk reactions against. In an era where we mostly talk past each other, C.K. has found a way to talk to both sides without adopting a neutered, feel-good, \""everyone\'s right\"" stance.Rightfully or not, we now trust comedians as we used to trust news anchors. C.K. earned his credibility by copping that he\'s a shitty person-a man who thinks dark thoughts, but would never act on them. And perhaps he\'s not so harmless. There have been allegations that he sexually harrasses[8] female comedians. This hasn\'t gained enough momentum to dislodge the majority of this trust, but there\'s no reason to think these women are lying. The closest he came to addressing this was in his Vulture[9] interview, when he said, \""if you need your public profile to be all positive, you\'re sick in the head. I do the work I do, and what happens next I can\'t look after.\""That\'s a dodge. C.K.\'s a flawed moral authority, but he excavates our nation\'s common denominators, linking disparate Americans together by the threads that we\'ve hidden out of defensiveness or embarrassment. And most times, he finds something filthy. As truth fractures into a kaleidoscope, C.K. acts as a clear putty that fills in the gaps between perspectives and reveals common ground. And he teaches us a lesson that he struggles to follow: that you can talk like an asshole without being one.References^ Louis C.K.

We never used to have any land down the dale, but because we went into stewardship schemes we decided to make silage away from the farm so that we could keep our stock numbers the same. In stewardship schemes the amount of stock you keep can be restricted.The fields may not be able to have fertiliser applied, so the amount of grass growth is restricted to protect the wildflowers and try to keep the fields as traditional as possible.Both my dad and I are unsure whether this is just going a step too far as what we have in the fields now is there because of how we have farmed up to now. Restricting farmers is making the fields go backwards. Making the silage away is becoming more important because the land isn\'t producing what it used to produce at home.After we mowed the grass we left it until the next day to scatter it out as when we started mowing the weather was getting better, but there just wasn\'t enough sun in the day to kill the grass that afternoon. It did keep looking like it could rain, but it never did. We only had to scatter it out the once as the weather came that good the grass soon killed, a good breeze and a bit of sun made it into some good silage. We did leave it until the next day to pick up, we rake the grass up into a row and then bale it up. We lead the bales into one field to wrap, my brother does this as he likes using the spikey bale trailer. There is a knack to it, it takes a bit of getting used to, but once you do its easy. Once they are led into the field then they are wrapped, we put six layers of wrap on these bales compared to four layers as we have to take them back home. There is less chance of tearing the wrap and making a hole in the bale if they have six layers on. We lead the bales back home when we have chance, we like to do it sooner rather than later because the grass can die off where the bales have been left, so it encourages weeds to grow. The silage we make down the dale normally has more feed value in than what we make at home and also it is easier to make silage down the dale as the weather is normally better!Now the weather is more like summer I have started getting ready for clipping. We clip the sheep in the sheds at home where the cows have overwintering. The first job to do was to muck the sheds out. We soon had this done and it looks more like a shed to clip in than before. We have a pen to put up in the feed passage that is just to bolt to the floor and shed and then we can start clipping. The sheep stand in one of the sheds that we have just cleaned out and then they come into the feed passage to be clipped. We haven\'t started yet, but I think we will have to this week as the weather is very warm now. I know I wouldn\'t want to have a woolly coat on in this weather would you?",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEkdcPNaelF3dMANGJ8ac_2idlqpQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=8bFQWeiJKcPmW7XOkJAH&url=http://www.harrogateadvertiser.co.uk/news/life-on-the-farm-column-with-frances-graham-1-8603905,EN,,26/06/2017 07:04,2017-06-25 09:06:44+00:00,51fe179e08,Harrogate Advertiser,,,,,1498388804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3a6f96c565,Daniel Radcliffe Is in Robot Chicken\'s Walking Dead Special ... - Gizmodo,"Daniel Radcliffe Is in Robot Chicken\'s Walking Dead Special Because the Actual Actor Wouldn\'t Sing\n\nImage: Adult SwimRemember Gareth, the leader of the cannabilistic Terminus faction from Walking Dead\'s fifth season? Well, Robot Chicken wanted actor Andrew J. West to reprise the role for a goofy skit for the upcoming Walking Dead special episodes. But it turns out West can\'t sing, so the team recruited Daniel Radcliffe instead.Radcliffe\'s cameo appearance will be in a skit where Gareth and the citizens of Terminus welcome Rick and the gang to town, before the revelation of, you know, the whole cannibal thing. Because this is Robot Chicken, they do so with an elaborate musical number. Speaking to Yahoo, director Tom Sheppard and writer Breckin Meyer revealed that West turned down a return to the character because he\'s not a singer. Instead, the Robot Chicken team found an surprising alternative:Sheppard: When we were going out to the actors from the show, the agent for the actor who played Gareth [Andrew J. West] from Terminus said he doesn\'t sing. So Seth [Green] put a call into Daniel Radcliffe...Meyer: As one does...Sheppard: Yes, like you would do. And basically we had Daniel Radcliffe singing the Terminus song.The thought of a group of antagonistic cannibals breaking out into a welcoming show tune is already zany enough for Robot Chicken, but the fact that it\'ll be a number led by Harry Potter just makes it even better.

3a8d739e99,Police: Piglet dies after being left in hot car at Houlton fair - WGME,"Police: Piglet dies after being left in hot car at Houlton fair\n\nHOULTON, Maine (BDN[1]) -- Police are investigating an incident at the Houlton Agricultural Fair in which a woman allegedly left three piglets she bought at the fair in a hot car, which caused one to die.The woman, who is not being identified since she has not been charged with a crime, acquired three piglets during the fair on Friday evening, Houlton Police Chief Joe McKenna said Tuesday.The animals were in a burlap bag that the woman put in her car with \""no ventilation,\"" McKenna said.It was not clear how long the piglets were in the vehicle, but Paul Cleary, president of the Houlton Agricultural Fair, said Tuesday that a gate attendant contacted fair officials to report that the animals had been left in the vehicle unattended and that one of the piglets \""did not look good.\""Cleary said fair board members used the fairground loudspeaker to try to contact the owner to return to the car. They also called police.The doors on the car were locked and there was no water inside for the animals, McKenna said.It was 83 degrees in Houlton that day, according to the National Weather Service in Caribou.\""By the time that we responded, one was dead, one was injured, and one was in pretty bad shape,\"" the chief said.Cleary said that when the woman returned to her car, she wanted to keep the two piglets that lived, but that the board members told the officer that should not happen, and they were given custody of the animals.He said the woman had not won the piglets as previously reported but had bought them from the children who won them in a pig scramble event at the fair.\""We have rules you have to follow [for the care of animals],\"" Cleary said.He indicated that winners are given instructions on how to care for the animals and there is an area at the fairgrounds in Community Park where the piglets could be kept and cared for while owners continue to enjoy the fair.McKenna said Tuesday that the town\'s animal control officer would be checking with the state\'s animal welfare office to discuss appropriate charges.References^ BDN (bangordailynews.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHfzH70YV3Pugb4_TiGuKke98IejA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=jP19V_jOLMKWzAaSwLuQDw&url=http://wgme.com/news/local/police-piglet-dies-after-being-left-in-hot-car-at-houlton-fair,EN,,07/07/2016 07:10,2016-07-06 13:54:04+00:00,c1967ab863,WGME,,,,,1467820444,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3ac92d5712,Norway Becomes the First Country to Ban Deforestation - Ecology Global Network,"Norway Becomes the First Country to Ban Deforestation\n\n\n				By Ruth Milka Nation of Change[1]\nOn May 26th the Norwegian Parliament pledged to be deforestation-free. They are the first country in history to ban deforestation.\n\nThe ban is a part of the government\'s procurement policy and includes eliminating the use of any product that contributes to deforestation as well as a request that the government exercise due care for the protection of biodiversity in its investments.\nThis will also affect how Norway sources products such as palm oil, soy, beef, and timber in order to leave little to no impact on their ecosystems. These products are responsible for 40 percent of deforestation between 2000 and 2011 in several countries, including Argentina and Brazil.\nThe Rainforest Foundation Norway has been working towards this policy for years. They pushed for the pledge, recommended officially by Norwegian Parliament\'s Standing Committee on Energy and Environment as part of the Action Plan on Nature Diversity.\nIn addition to pledging to stop deforestation, Norway is also responsible for funding several environmental projects worldwide, including $250 million invested in protecting Guyana\'s forest. They also paid $1 billion to Brazil for completing a 2008 agreement to prevent deforestation.\nFighting deforestation could not only save the world\'s rain forests, which could completely vanish in a hundred years[2], but also helps with climate change. When forests are cleared by burning the carbon in trees is released as carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the leading greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.\n \nYou might also like:							References^ Nation of Change (www.nationofchange.org)^ vanish in a hundred years (environment.nationalgeographic.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEnVsMNA_CzEHmkyNt7AU5QbJQ-hQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779129460833&ei=jpOEV9iGEMGKzAair6qoCw&url=http://www.ecology.com/2016/06/10/norway-country-ban-deforestation/,EN,,12/07/2016 07:04,2016-06-10 19:20:15+00:00,6b7af8fb69,Ecology Global Network,,,,,1465593615,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, shared on Twitter the scene of two hotel workers cracking open the letter box the chute feeds into and fishing around for the bird\'s carcass. (The hotel occupies the Old Post Office, which opened in 1899 as Washington\'s main mail depot.)\n\nThey\'re just getting around to removing that dead bird at Trump hotel. https://t.co/0Kwh2WUmq4 @washingtonian pic.twitter.com/5rl18kT0ny[2][3][4]\n- Patrick Murray (@PollsterPatrick) September 20, 2016[5]\n\nThe bird\'s species has not been identified, although New Yorker staff writer Philip Gourevitch guesses it was a dove[6]. In DC, the Department of Public Works oversees the removal of dead animals.\nMurray also writes on Twitter that the hotel employee in the blue shirt became \""a bit suspicious\"" when Murray asked about the bird. The most recent set of Monmouth polls have given Donald Trump slight edges in Georgia, Iowa, and Nevada, while the New Jersey school\'s last national poll-released August 29-gave Hillary Clinton a 7 percentage point lead, although the presidential race has become significantly closer since then.

(AP) - Authorities say no foul play is suspected in the deaths of two dozen cows in the Heber and Overgaard areas.   Navajo County sheriff\'s officials said Thursday that ranchers in the last few days have reported finding cattle deceased.   They say a Heber rancher reported two dead cows on Sunday. That was followed two days later with 14 cattle being found dead in the same area. Other reports have come in since.    Sheriff\'s deputies say several samples have been collected from the cattle for testing by a state laboratory.     So far, it appears the cattle all suffered a \""natural occurring ecological poisoning\"" caused by forest conditions.   The results of toxicology tests are not yet completed.   The investigation remains ongoing with assistance from state Game and Fish and the U.S. Forest Service.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFOWAhwBwDNn_93Z_0DxB2o42UNKg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52780045716650&ei=8LCcW_mTFonazQbO74noBQ&url=http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/2018/09/14/natural-poisoning-causing-cow-deaths-navajo-county/,EN,,15/09/2018 07:12,2018-09-14 20:37:59+00:00,c9593f6e51,Tucson News Now,,,,,1536964679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3d419c0742,Assam\'s River Island Residents See Land Sinking As Brahmaputra ... - NDTV,"Assam\'s River Island Residents See Land Sinking As Brahmaputra Swells\n\nPeople living in Assam\'s river island of Borghul Char said they are waiting for more aid to arriveBorghul Char, Assam: \n                                It takes an hour\'s ride in a rickety motorised boat on the swelling Brahmaputra river to reach the riverine island of Borghul Char in Assam. The island, which is right in the middle of India\'s widest river, has been sinking as the water level has been rising. The battle to survive has just started for some 150 families who live on this island at the flood-hit Barpeta district.Samshul Mia, 52, a jute cultivator who took to fishing and a resident of the riverine island, has seen flood all his life. But this year the experience - especially this week - has been scary for him and his family, Mr Mia said. Floodwater has breached the island at many places.\""My home was washed away three days ago, after which we shifted to a spot a few hundred metres inside. But the island is sinking,\"" Mr Mia told NDTV. \""A few families have shifted to other parts and livestock have been washed away,\"" he added.While two waves of flood have ravaged the picturesque island district of Majuli in the Brahmaputra in the last two months, 12 per cent of Assam\'s population or three million people live in some 2,500 island villages in the river\'s tributaries. Most of the people who live in these flood-prone parts are fisherfolk and small farmers. The flood in Assam has displaced thousands of peoplePeople living on the now-sinking riverine island of Borghul Char told NDTV they hope the government would reach out to them.\""Every night we are scared. The river is fuming. Our houses are gone. We fear for our lives,\"" Moinal Mia, another resident of the river island, said.Some 1,000 people on the island have moved to higher ground - a small patch of land which is also the only safe spot for now. A primary school, a mosque and a community hall have gone underwater.The island\'s residents, including children, are staying at small tents made of plastic sheets that they got from the government some years ago during flood. A few people have brought their cattle to the safe zone.The people at the camp say they did not get a single meal till some days ago, and government relief came a week after the place was flooded.\""We are lucky that this small patch of highland remained, otherwise we would have been swept away,\"" Monwara Begum, an island resident, said. Riverine island residents say the flood has been quite bad this yearEvery year hundreds of people who live in the Brahmaputra\'s riverine islands experience the same ordeal during flood.\""The way the government should look after its citizens during crisis is completely missing here. There is a sense of neglect,\"" said Aliwar Hussain, who lost his home to floodwater. \""After the first wave of flood... for a month we got relief foodgrains only twice.

3e48370af6,Manson ex-follower should be denied parole -prosecutor - Yahoo News,"Manson ex-follower should be denied parole -prosecutor\n\nBy Dan WhitcombLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles\' top prosecutor on Tuesday urged California Governor Jerry Brown to keep former Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten behind bars, despite the recommendation of a parole board that she be released.Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a five-page letter to the governor that Van Houten\'s role in the Aug. 9, 1969, stabbing murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca and her still \""disturbingly distorted\"" view of Manson made her unsuitable for parole.\""She simply does not see (Manson) for the brutal megalomaniac that he is,\"" Lacey wrote, adding that during her parole hearing Van Houten described the cult leader as \""a \'myth\' of a person\"" and a \""caricature of horror.\""\""This description alone would lead to the rational conclusion that inmate Van Houten has no appreciation of the magnitude of her involvement with the Manson Family nor her crimes,\"" Lacey wrote.Van Houten, 66, is serving a life sentence for the LaBianca murders, which were directed by Manson as part of a plan to incite a race war between whites and blacks.The LaBiancas were stabbed to death, after which the killers used their blood to write \""Rise,\"" \""Death to Pigs\"" and \""Healter-Skelter,\"" a misspelled reference to a Beatles song, on the walls and a refrigerator door.Van Houten was found guilty of the LaBianca murders in 1971 and sentenced to death but that conviction and sentence were overturned on appeal. She was retried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1978.A two-member panel of California\'s Board of Parole Hearings recommended parole for Van Houten in April after a hearing with her at the state prison in Corona, California, where she is serving her sentence.Brown can uphold that recommendation, overturn it or order further hearings.Also among the victims of Manson and his mostly young, female followers was actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski. She was stabbed 16 times by cult members.Four other people were stabbed or shot to death at Tate\'s home that night by the Manson followers, who scrawled the word \""Pig\"" in blood on the front door before leaving. Van Houten was not involved in the Tate murders, which occurred the night before the LaBianca slayings.Manson, now 81, is serving a life sentence at Corcoran State Prison in California for the seven Tate-LaBianca killings and the murder of another man, Gary Hinman, in July 1969.(Editing by G Crosse and Matthew Lewis)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGaEnYNHef8Hs8OGcP-92xr7w3Reg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779143281548&ei=eHFzV5JO4ezMBte7s9AH&url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/l-prosecutor-asks-governor-deny-parole-ex-manson-223612499.html,EN,,29/06/2016 07:08,2016-06-28 21:48:45+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,Yahoo News,,,,,1467157725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3ff749fe8c,"Sean Bean hasn\'t been killed more than any other actor: He\'s still behind Vincent Price, Bela Lugosi and John Hurt - Daily Mail","Sean Bean hasn\'t been killed more than any other actor: He\'s still behind Vincent Price, Bela Lugosi and John Hurt\n\nAll men must die, but Game of Thrones star Sean Bean has died a lot more than most.In fact, his habit of dying onscreen has led to a running online joke that he\'s the most-killed man in Hollywood. However, that\'s not exactly true according to The Nerdist[1]. While Bean has the highest death-to-appearance ratio, three actors have all died more times than him.Scroll down for video     \n    \n      \n\n    Dead famous: Sean Bean is renowned for dying frequently in his movies and TV shows - such as his heroic death as Boromir (right) in the first Lord of the Rings movie. But a recent report revealed that he\'s not the actor with the highest body count\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n      \n\nUnhappy ending: Bean was shot in The Hitcher (left) and beheaded in Game of Thrones (right), and died in around 35 per cent of the films he appeared in - the highest percentage of any actor. But others have a higher total death count\n    \n      \n\nBean will be recognizable to TV viewers as Ned Stark, the noble Northern Lord of Winterfell who failed to use his head while playing the Game of Thrones - and lost both as a result.But he\'s just as prone to dying on the big screen, and in total he has clocked in 24 deaths across 70 appearances on film and TV.Those include being arrowed to death as Boromir in The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, being dropped from a great height by James Bond in GoldenEye, taking a shotgun to the head in the 2007 remake of The Hitcher, and being skewered on an anchor by Harrison Ford in Patriot Games.Perhaps his most bizarre death was being run off a cliff by a herd of maddened cows in Irish drama film The Field. But in terms of total deaths, Bean is lagging behind.In third place with 33 overall deaths is horror legend Vincent Price, perhaps most recognizable to younger audiences as the narrator from Michael Jackson\'s Thriller.His piercing glare and wry delivery made him a perfect fit for somewhat campy horror movies including The Fly and House of Wax, as well as a string of Edgar Allen Poe adaptations including The Pit and the Pendulum.Naturally, being a horror star, his characters frequently bit the bullet - or axe, or massive vat of molten wax, as appropriate. In second place with 36 deaths is another horror favorite: Hungarian-American actors Bela Lugosi, who played Dracula in the Universal Pictures adaptation of the book.Typecast as a horror villain because of his thick Hungarian accent, he inevitably ended up dying gruesome deaths at the hands of \'all-American\' heroes.He eventually died partway through the filming of Ed Wood\'s notoriously terrible horror movie Plan 9 From Outer Space, and his role was filled in by another actor draping a sheet over his face.But both Lugosi and Price are left behind by British actor John Hurt, who has bought the farm in no less than 43 films and TV shows. \n    \n      \n\n\n    \n      \n\nHorrible history: Vincent Price (left, being hung in The Baron of Arizona) and Bela Lugosi (right, as Dracula), both classic horror actors, have both died more than Bean: Price 33 times and Lugosi 36 times\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n      \n\nLiving up to his name: John Hurt has the highest total number of on-screen deaths, at 43. Probably his most iconic is in Alien, in which the titular xenomorph bursts gorily out of his chest - a much-parodied momentThey include historical drama A Man for All Seasons, in which he played British courtesan Richard Rich, and the titular role in David Lynch\'s celebrated The Elephant Man. Both ultimately die peacefully in bed.But Hurt\'s most famous role doesn\'t involve dying peacefully at all. As Kane, a space ship officer  in the 1979 movie Alien, he was given one of the most iconic deaths in modern horror, clutching his chest just before a ghastly alien bursts out of it.The scene was so instantly iconic that he even recreated the scene in the 1987 Mel Brooks spoof Spaceballs.The top ten is rounded off by Japanese-American actor Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Gary Busey and Mickey Rourke (all with 23 deaths); Robert de Niro (19), Lance Henriksen (16) and Samuel L Jackson (15). The highest ranking woman is Charlize Theron with nine.References^ The Nerdist (nerdist.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHOMZvYAweQFlphN-WlVkkynRD6dg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779321284421&ei=oxhiWLiUAYyzWe-YhtAK&url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4067312/Bean-gone-Sean-Bean-highest-death-movie-ratio-time-British-actor-killed-far-has.html,EN,,27/12/2016 08:11,2016-12-27 00:31:48+00:00,c9593f6e51,Daily Mail,,,,,1482802308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

43bcf4ca77,Spanish Archbishop Fires Professor Seifert for Amoris Laetitia Critique - Catholic Citizens of Illinois (press release),"Spanish Archbishop Fires Professor Seifert for Amoris Laetitia Critique\n\n\n				By Maike Hickson, September 4, 2017\nTo the joy and encouragement of many faithful Catholics, Professor Josef Seifert, a prominent Catholic philosopher, defender of life and a former member of the Pontifical Academy for Life (PAL), has published two essays containing a charitable and clear critique of the papal document Amoris Laetitia. Professor Seifert published his first, more detailed critique in August of 2016, and then, only recently, his shorter, more pointed one in which he speaks of the logic of a possible dissolution of any absolute moral law, should Pope Francis not revoke some premises and certain statements from Amoris Laetitia. With these two texts, he has made a lucid and charitable Catholic witness in defense of the traditional and infallible moral teaching of the Catholic Church for which he has for some time now had to suffer. In 2016, in response to Professor Seifert\'s first essay, the Archbishop of Granada, Spain, where Professor Seifert had been teaching, excluded him from his teaching of seminarians in his archdiocese. Moreover, as of 31 August of this year, Archbishop Javier Martínez Fernández has announced that he decided, rather abruptly, to force Professor Seifert into retirement as a direct response to the Austrian scholar\'s second critique of Amoris Laetitia. Without any discernable sign of mercy, the archbishop claims that Seifert\'s essays are confusing to the faithful, and he publicly announces to have adopted for his own archdiocese the pastoral guidelines from the bishops of the region of Buenos Aires, Argentina. (OnePeterFive has reported on it here.) Significantly, Archbishop Martínez Fernández has just posted, on 3 September, on his diocesan website an article about Archbishop Victor Manuel Fernández\'s own defense of Amoris Laetitia.\nPlease pray for Professor Seifert, that he may have the graces to deal with this great injustice, but also that Archbishop Martínez Fernández may realize that Professor Seifert has done a great service for the greater good of the Church and the salvation of souls by pointing out doctrinal errors and moral dangers stemming from Amoris Laetitia.\nIn his 31 August statement, the Spanish archbishop raises very serious and offensive charges against Professor Seifert without offering any reasons for them. He claims that Seifert\'s article \""damages the communion of the Church.\"" Since the Seifert essay only puts a question to the pope, who is asked to answer it, the article cannot damage the communion of the Church at all. Moreover, if the assertion in Amoris Laetitia that God can want a couple to commit an intrinsically wrong act of adultery, leads logically to the claim that God can also want, in some situations, contraception or abortion, then this assertion should be fittingly revoked by the pope. Since this is Seifert\'s argument in his new essay, he greatly helps the Catholic Faith and does not at all damage the communion of the Church, which is a communion based on an ethical truth that has, for 2000 years, always held the opposite to this current affirmation in Amoris Laetitia, namely that God never can want men to commit an intrinsically evil act. Instead of damaging the communion of the Church, Seifert thus helps by putting it on the foundation of moral truth, which alone can guarantee this communion and thus unite the present Church with the past and perennial one.\nThe archbishop claims, without offering the slightest reason, that Seifert\'s paper \""confuses the faith of the faithful.\"" We find, on the contrary, that the article clarifies the raging confusion of the faithful through its clear distinctions and reasons. The Spanish archbishop also claims that Seifert\'s paper \""sows distrust in the successor of Peter,\"" while in reality it affectionately presents a moving and filial appeal to the successor of Peter as the \""sweet Christ on Earth\"" - as he calls the pope in the words once used by St. Catherine of Siena - to revoke a specific statement IF he comes to recognize the grave and logical consequences of the above-mentioned assertion.\nMoreover, Archbishop Martínez Fernández claims that Seifert\'s paper \""in the end, does not serve the truth of faith, but, rather, the interests of the world.\"" This charge is particularly puzzling. How does Seifert\'s strong defense of the moral absolutes of \""do not ever commit adultery!\"", \""do not ever use contraception,\"" \""do not ever kill the unborn,\"" serve the interests of a world whose utilitarian thinking and morals violate worldwide these moral absolutes, to include among them Doctors without Frontiers, refugee camps, and Catholic hospitals?\nWhen the archbishop states that the Diocese of Granada \""has adopted, from its very beginning, the application of the pontifical text prepared by the Bishops of the Region of Buenos Aires [Argentina],\"" he keeps forgetting that he first sent to his whole clergy the statement of Monsignor Livio Melina as a guideline, which was concordant with that of Cardinal Gerhard Müller and with that of the Polish Bishops, namely, that Amoris Laetitia had not changed anything regarding the sacramental discipline from what has been said in Familiaris Consortio. Only later, in a radical reversal of his earlier guidelines, Archbishop Martínez Fernández unexpectedly then switched to the position now upheld by the Bishops of Buenos Aires who, in opposition to Pope John Paul II\'s own teaching and 2000 years of the Church\'s sacramental discipline, have decided to admit couples \""in irregular situations\"" - after a period of ostensible discernment - to the sacraments. In proposing the guidelines of the Bishops of the Buenos Aires region as a binding and absolute law for his diocese, Archbishop Martínez Fernández has acted far more \""papally than Pope Francis,\"" who has left to the Polish Bishops, for example, the full freedom of abiding by the sacramental guidelines set down by Pope John Paul II, and has also left it to individual bishops and bishops\' conferences to interpret Amoris Laetitia along the lines of Cardinal Müller, i.e., in full unity with the existing traditional guidelines.\nIn a word, it seems to us scandalous and a violation of the rights of an eminent Catholic scholar, philosopher, and personal friend of Pope John Paul II, that Archbishop Javier Martínez wants to dismiss him from a Catholic institution on the basis of false claims and false charges raised against one of the most deeply believing and faithful, and pope-loving Catholic thinkers, who had proven his loyalty to the papacy not only through his close collaboration with Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI, but also through his attempts to aid the Magisterium of Pope Francis by offering him, in deep reverence and charity, precious pieces of advice as to how to secure the unity of the Church based on the truth.\nWe now publish here below Archbishop Martínez Fernández\' public statement concerning this matter, in its entirety (our translation):\nConcerning an Article Published by Professor Josef Seifert on the Post-synodal Exhortation of Pope Francis, Amoris Laetitia\nThe Diocese of Granada deeply regrets the article recently published by Professor Josef Seifert on the Post-Synodal Exhortation of Pope Francisco Amoris Laetitia, because it damages the communion of the Church, confuses the faith of the faithful, and sows distrust in the successor of Peter, which, in the end, does not serve the truth of faith, but, rather, the interests of the world. The Diocese of Granada has adopted, from its very beginning, the application of the pontifical text prepared by the Bishops of the Region of Buenos Aires, recognized by the Holy Father, which is accessible to all on the website of the diocese.\nProfessor Seifert is one of the founders of the International Academy of Philosophy of Liechtenstein, an institution that has been rendering for decades a remarkable service to Christian thought, especially in Eastern Europe and Latin America. In recent years, Professor Seifert has been teaching at the Institute of Philosophy \""Edith Stein\"" in Granada, which is currently the headquarters of this Academy in Granada. Professor Seifert stopped his teaching at the \""Edith Stein\"" Institute as early as September 2016, following his first critical writing on Amoris Laetitia, published in German. And right now, concurring with the precise and fuller reasons for it, his retirement from the above-mentioned International Academy of Philosophy is now being processed.\nGranada, August 31, 2017\n \nhttps://onepeterfive.com/spanish-archbishop-fires-professor-seifert-for-amoris-laetitia-critique/[1]\n			References^ https://onepeterfive.com/spanish-archbishop-fires-professor-seifert-for-amoris-laetitia-critique/ (onepeterfive.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEP1EcFbcLEVJUs0qYEByKgfvJPGA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=Bu-wWdCvH8mzWaWSjYAC&url=https://catholiccitizens.org/news/73933/spanish-archbishop-fires-professor-seifert-amoris-laetitia-critique/,EN,,07/09/2017 07:01,2017-09-06 20:51:57+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,Catholic Citizens of Illinois (pres,,,,,1504738317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43fc7363db,Ross Douthat: The pigs of liberalism - Santa Cruz Sentinel,"Ross Douthat: The pigs of liberalism\n\n\n                                    \n\n										\nIf you are surprised by the news that Harvey Weinstein of Miramax fame, a man well-known for profane tirades and physical altercations and scrounging M&Ms off movie theater floors, is also the sort of charmer who loafs around seminude while asking subordinates for \""back\"" massages, then you can be surprised by just about anything: the sun rising in the east, the fact that movie stars employ plastic surgeons, the news that \""The Artist\"" didn\'t actually deserve to win Best Picture.Weinstein\'s response to The New York Times\' impressive investigatory work was to issue a statement promising to spend even more lavishly on liberal causes. Like a knight promising a crusade against the Saracens as penance for raping and pillaging at home, the mogul\'s assumption seemed to be that the right political commitment can cover over piggishness and vice.\nDoes it? Probably not; at the very least, he faces an extended period of exile. But Weinstein is older now and not as influential as in his heyday. The whole \""forgive me, I\'m a liberal\"" thing won\'t protect him now, but it was part of his carapace for decades, during which time everyone who mattered clamored for his friendship and fundraising prowess despite all the stories there to hear.Maybe his overdue exposure shows that the world has changed, and progressive industries are finally feminist enough to put their old goats out to pasture.\nBut it might just show that a certain kind of powerful liberal creep only gets his comeuppance when he\'s weakened or old or in the grave. The awfulness of Ted Kennedy, at Chappaquiddick and after hours in D.C., can be acknowledged only now that he\'s no longer a liberal lion in the Senate. The possibility that Bill Clinton might be not just an adulterer but also a rapist can be entertained now that he\'s no longer protecting abortion from the White House. The sins of Woody Allen ... well, I\'m sure Hollywood will start ostracizing him any day now.\nLast Sunday, I wrote a harsh obituary for Hugh Hefner, which noted that he represented a certain style of liberalism - progressive and yet chauvinist, liberationist and exploitative - that perdures in our society to this day. Some readers were skeptical: Didn\'t Hef\'s feminist critics win the fight for liberalism, while his Playboy philosophy became something of a joke?The answer is yes, at the level of ideological commitment - but not so much in practice. In the real life of liberalism, Hefnerism endures as the effective philosophy of many liberal men, for whom sexual individualism justifies using women because hey, we\'re all cool consenting adults here, and caddishness blurs into predation when power differentials permit. Meanwhile, feminism struggles to find norms that check this kind of behavior, swinging between a facile sex-positivity and illiberal attempts to police the hookup scene.\n \r\nAdvertisement\r\n\nHere it would be nice to say that cultural conservatism offers an alternative, one that welcomes female advancement while retaining useful ideas about sexual difference and restraint. I might have argued as much once. But in the age of Donald Trump and Bill O\'Reilly, \""pro-life\"" hypocrites in Congress and the \""alt-right\"" online cesspool, the right is its own sort of cautionary tale.So I\'ll say something more modest: If liberals want to restrain the ogres in their midst, a few conservative ideas might be helpful.\nFirst: Some modest limits on how men and women interact professionally are useful checks on predation. Many liberals were horrified by the revelation that for a time Mike Pence avoided one-on-one meetings with women not his wife. But one can find the Pence rules too sweeping and still recognize that life is easier for women if their male bosses don\'t feel entitled to see them anywhere, anytime. It would not usher in the Republic of Gilead if it were understood that inviting your female subordinate to your hotel room, Weinstein-style, crosses a line in a way that a restaurant lunch does not.\nSecond: Consent alone is not a sufficient guide to ethics. Caddishness and predation can be a continuum. If you cheat on your wife, you may be more likely to harass subordinates. Promiscuity can encourage predatory entitlement. Older rules of moral restraint were broader for a reason. If your culture\'s code is libertine, don\'t be surprised that worse things than libertinism flourish.Third: You can\'t ignore moral character when you make decisions about whom to vote for or work with or support. This was something conservatives used to argue in the Clinton years; under Trump, many have conveniently forgotten it. But it remains true. Yes, sometimes you have to work with a bad person or vote for a bad person or hold a fundraiser with a bad person for the greater good. But not nearly as often as you think.\nThe truth is that while not everyone knew exactly how Harvey Weinstein treated women, everyone knew what kind of man he was.

449b217062,Beef prices harden slightly but weekly kill strikes 34900 head - Agriland,"Beef prices harden slightly but weekly kill strikes 34,900 head\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a slight improvement in factory beef prices, as procurement managers seem keen to secure cattle for the Christmas market.\nBoth steer and heifer prices have hardened slightly this week, but most buyers are keen to maintain the status quo when it comes to base price of 365c/kg and 375c/kg respectively.\nAlthough, one factory in the southern half of the country has began negotiations with farmers at a base price of 370c/kg for steers and 380c/kg for heifers.\nAs has been the norm in recent weeks, in-spec cattle are in demand, with many procurement managers willing to pay an extra 5c/kg on top of the base price to secure supplies.\nBut procurement managers are keen to stress that strong supplies remain a worry, particularly as we edge closer to 2017.\nLooking at cows, most plants have maintained prices at last week\'s levels, with 300-310c/kg becoming the norm for R grade cows, while farmers can expect to be offered 280-290c/kg for the plainer P and O grade animals.\nThere has also been little or no movement in young bulls prices, which are currently sitting at 370c/kg, 380c/kg and 390c/kg for O, R and U grade bulls respectively.\nBeef prices:\nSteers: 365-370c/kg\nHeifers: 375-380c/kg\nR grade cows: 300-310c/kg\nO grade cows: 290c/kg\nP grade cows: 280c/kg\n\nWeekly kill hits 34,944 head\nThe number of cattle slaughtered in Department of Agriculture approved export plants hit the 34,944 head mark during the week ending November 27.\nThis is an increase of 262 head or 0.8% on the week before.\nThe majority of the increase in supplies can be attributed to heifer throughput, which increased by 344 head or 3.6% on the week before.\nYoung bull and steer throughput also increased, with supplies up by 1.2% (+40 head) and 1.8% (+237 head) on the week before.\nMeanwhile, figures from the Department of Agriculture also show that aged bull and cow slaughterings fell compared to the week ending November 20, with supplies down by 4.8% (-25 head) and 4.1% (-335 head).\nWeek-on-week beef kill changes:\nYoung bulls: +40 head (+1.2%)\nAged bulls: -25 head (-4.8%)\nSteers: +237 head (+1.8%)\nCows: -335 head (-4.1%)\nHeifers: +344 head (+3.6%)\nTotal: +262 head (+0.8%)\n\nMain markets\nAccording to Bord Bia, the British beef market remains steady with little change reported in either supply or demand.\nPrices from the AHDB show that British R4L steers averaged 366.8p/kg (430.65c/kg) during the week ending November 25, while R3 heifers made the equivalent of 422c/kg in Britain and 409c/kg in Northern Ireland.\nBord Bia also reports that the French beef trade has shown little change, with lower market demand for steak cuts, while offal has performed best.\nRetail promotions were centered mainly on domestically produced product such as ribs and steaks.\nThe R3 young bull price was unchanged making on average 362c/kg while the O3 cow price was down 1c making 296c/kg on average, it says.\n\nRelated

Organizers have tagged the march as a nonpartisan opportunity for people to \""stand together in solidarity with our partners and children for the protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families - recognizing that our vibrant and diverse communities are the strength of our country.\"" Critics contend that the march is a protest against Trump\'s presidency, ABC News[4] reported. Several groups, which opposed Trump\'s candidacy, have joined the Women\'s March as partners, including the American Civil Liberties Union[5], Amnesty International[6], Emily\'s List[7], Planned Parenthood[8], GLAAD[9] and the Muslim Women\'s Alliance[10] all signed on as the event grew in size. In addition, the co-owner of a Vermont based company[11] offered her employees two nights in a hotel and airfare if they came to the nation\'s capital to protest. Organizers said one of the goals of the march is to tell the new administration that on Day One, \""women\'s rights are human rights.\""  Prior to the march, a three-hour rally will be held on the National Mall with musical headliners Janelle Monae, Questlove, and Grimes, along with celebrity speakers that include America Ferrera, Angela Davis, Gloria Steinem, Ashley Judd, Melissa Harris-Perry, and Michael Moore. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards is one of the keynote speakers. Rallies also are being held worldwide. According to Buzzfeed[12], thousands of marchers gathered Saturday morning in Sydney, Australia. Marchers in Australia carried signs that contained slogans like \""Feminism is my Trump card,\"" and \""Women of the world unite.\""\n			\n			References^ Women\'s March (www.womensmarch.com)^ >> Read more trending stories (news.google.com)^ Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency (hsema.dc.gov)^ ABC News (abcnews.go.com)^ American Civil Liberties Union (www.aclu.org)^ Amnesty International (www.amnestyusa.org)^ Emily\'s List (www.emilyslist.org)^ Planned Parenthood (www.plannedparenthood.org)^ GLAAD (www.glaad.org)^ Muslim Women\'s Alliance (mwachicago.org)^ Vermont based company (www.wokv.com)^ Buzzfeed (www.buzzfeed.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHAHnTC86aKoB-Si6T0k-yhR5ILfA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779354460922&ei=hQuDWNinBeKMzAbm6JDoBg&url=http://www.whio.com/news/national/woman-accused-taping-her-toddler-son-wall-arrested/aNdJYulVmFKAwDku3p5K6N/,EN,,21/01/2017 08:04,2017-01-19 21:03:21+00:00,51fe179e08,WHIO,,,,,1484863401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

454b7c0868,Rosendale Farmhouse Haunted By What Could Have Been - Kfiz,"Rosendale Farmhouse Haunted By What Could Have Been\n\n\n\n29-Jan-2018\n\nWhen you enter an old farmhouse on Rose Eld Road in Rosendale you have to step carefully. The floor is littered with shattered glass, wood, and broken house fixtures. KFIZ News toured the home to observe the damage done by local kids. Shelly Rosenkranz has been a friend of the owner for more than 15 years. She gave us the tour. What happened there upsets her. She says, \""Well I don\'t want to cry, but I feel bad for him. Because now he will probably have to be responsible for tearing this house down and it is not right that it would cost him all that money to do that.\"" The owner of the farmhouse is Joel Streblow, a Gulf War Veteran. He had dreams of turning it into a group home, but now will have to tear it down. It\'s suspected that three kids prosecuted for vandalism at Taylor Park in Rosendale were also involved in vandalizing the farm house. The Fond du Lac County Sheriff\'s Department wasn\'t able to prove that connection. Sheriff\'s Captain Ryan Waldschmidt says the time lapse between the vandalism and when it was reported and reluctant witnesses hindered their investigation. He says, \""You know when you are victimized by a crime, that\'s what we exist for, that\'s one of our responsibilities is investigating these.\"" Rosenkranz and Streblow were frustrated with the Sheriff\'s investigation. But the department took a second look at it this past week. Waldschmidt says kids can\'t resist the haunted house-like quality the farmhouse has taken on. He\'s right it is haunted, by dreams of what could have been and innocence lost in thoughtless actions.  \n\n\n\n\nShelly Rosenkranz points out some of the interior damage.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNF0AS4i9ULV1zgmYU6zVVzAvksqZg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=LRt0WvGcBomZzQaFpa-4Cw&url=http://www.kfiz.com/local-news/rosendale-farmhouse-haunted-by-what-could-have-been,EN,,02/02/2018 08:00,2018-01-29 05:01:29+00:00,5b41d61294,Kfiz,,,,,1517205689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inmiddels zijn er meer dan 188 kadavers van everzwijnen geanalyseerd, 157 binnen het veiligheidsgebied van 63.000 hectare. De meeste besmette dieren werden aangetroffen in de dorpjes Buzenol, Ethe en in het militaire domein Lagland bij Aarlen.\n\n\n				De besmetting is nog steeds beperkt gebleven tot de afgebakende zone en er hoeven geen extra  varkensbedrijven te worden geruimd. Eind deze week zal blijken of er minder besmette zwijnen worden gevonden en of er geen infecties zijn buiten het afgebakende gebied. Aan het eind van deze week zijn er 6 weken voorbijgegaan sinds de eerste melding.

4cba7c59ac,Wyoming worries over Whiskey Mountain bighorn sheep - goHUNT.com (blog),"Wyoming worries over Whiskey Mountain bighorn sheep\n\n\n        \n     Back to News\n                \n        \n                \n\nPhoto credit: Shutterstock\n\nAs bighorn sheep herds continue to falter across the West, states search for ways to prevent the massive die-offs. For Wyoming, that means focusing on the Whiskey Mountain herd-a bighorn sheep herd that has been struggling for decades. In May, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that 1,431 acres of winter range would be set aside for this herd in hopes that providing critical habitat would help the herd rebound. Now, Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) officials are partnering with the Wyoming Wild Sheep Foundation, the National Bighorn Sheep Interpretive Center and the University of Wyoming\'s Ruckleshaus Institute \""to explore management concerns, issues and opportunities\"" for the Whiskey Mountain bighorn sheep herd, Buckrail reports.\n\nAs goHUNT previously reported, the iconic herd experienced a massive die-off linked to pneumonia in 1990 and 1991, which decimated nearly half of the herd. Today\'s herd is estimated at only about 850 animals, which is nearly 40% under the 1,350-sheep goal set by the state. Biologists believe that the cause is a combination of high fawn mortality coupled with poor nutrition, hence the Interior\'s decision to renew the mineral withdrawal for critical winter range.\n\n\n\n\""The bottom-line is, we simply don\'t have the answers how to turn this important bighorn sheep population around,\"" says Daryl Lutz, WGFD\'s wildlife management coordinator. \""There is much to be learned how to best address this decline and perhaps implement management strategies and projects to attempt to arrest and reverse this trend. To do this, it is clear we must consider a different approach.\""\n\nWith details as to what that approach will be still under wraps, WGFD and its partners hope to get started with an assessment in late summer or early fall before holding workshops geared toward strategizing how to best approach the situation. Workshops will be open to anyone interested in saving the Whiskey Mountain bighorn sheep herd as well as bighorn sheep specialists from around the country, according to Buckrail. More details on the workshops will be available later this fall. In the meantime, if you are interested in learning more, contact Daryl Lutz at 307-335-2616.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNG_XGjluhcFE156FG6gFYbBsfM-8A&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=VIk0W-mbI4P9zAbKyKbQDg&url=https://www.gohunt.com/read/news/wyoming-worries-over-whiskey-mountain-bighorn-sheep,EN,,28/06/2018 09:38,2018-06-27 12:57:49+00:00,7903d30a98,goHUNT.com (blog),,,,,1530111469,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

50e9bade0f,Gov. Kasich proposes tax changes - Ironton Tribune,"Gov. Kasich proposes tax changes\n\n\n											Opposition likely from own party\nCOLUMBUS (AP) - Ohioans would see a 17 percent income tax cut and a two-year college tuition freeze under a budget plan Gov. John Kasich said Monday balances investments that support Ohio\'s economic stability while grappling with scarce state resources.\nThe Republican governor would pay for the programs in part through tax hikes on alcohol, tobacco products and gas drilling. He also would impose a half-percent increase in the state sales tax, from 5.75 percent to 6.25 percent, and extend it to additional services, including cable TV subscriptions, elective cosmetic surgery and lobbying.\nThe tax increases are likely to face opposition from Republican majorities in the state Legislature.\nKasich said the $66.9 billion, two-year spending blueprint ensures \""that we don\'t send a message to the economic universe that we\'re getting weak.\""\n\""My No. 1 goal here is economic stability, fiscal stability,\"" Kasich said.\nCovering the two years beginning July 1, the budget spends $4.3 billion less in state general revenue than the previous budget.\nThe administration bolsters its tax and spending proposals with a host of money-saving ideas. Those include the use of data analytics to help solve big problems like infant mortality, illiteracy and heroin addiction; streamlining business tax collections; giving more high-school and college credits for skills, competencies and apprenticeships; and bringing all state computers into the cloud by the time Kasich leaves office in two years.\nThe budget calls for modest additional spending for K-12 schools, higher education and prisons, while delivering flat funds or cuts to a number of other agencies. Infrastructure spending is increased by 20 percent, which Kasich said is remarkable considering the plan delivers a small net tax cut of $39 million. He said the 1-percent increase in primary and secondary education funding represents record spending, despite the modest percentage.\nState Budget Director Tim Keen said reductions in state tax outlay shouldn\'t be viewed in isolation. He noted that his office was able to use income from state offices that draw revenues from outside sources, such as fees or federal grants, to offset apparent general revenue cuts to some agencies.\nStill, Keen described the budget as the toughest he\'s ever had to write. He said it prioritizes education and protects Ohio\'s most vulnerable citizens.\nThe two-year tuition freeze would be accompanied by a freeze on general fees and special fees at higher education institutions. The schools would be required to provide student textbooks by fall 2018, and could charge a $300 fee to cover part of the cost.\nBalancing the budget relies on $200 million from a new monthly premium that would be charged to Medicaid beneficiaries who are childless, not pregnant and have an income level above the poverty level.\nLast year, federal regulators rejected a plan that would have required more Medicaid beneficiaries to pay a monthly premium than the proposal rolled out Monday. The feds said that plan could have led to tens of thousands of low-income people losing health care coverage.\nThe administration said Monday the state will seek federal approval for its new premium plan, which would cap monthly premiums at 2 percent of household income. Premiums are estimated at about $20 a month. The budget plan also makes prescription-drug changes to Medicaid saving roughly $40 million.\nTax Commissioner Joe Testa said the proposed alcohol tax increase would amount to about a penny for a glass of beer or wine. He said it\'s not been \""modernized\"" since 1992.\n\""That was the year of \'Silence of the Lambs,\' \'My Cousin Vinnie\' and AmeriFlora,\"" he said.\nKasich\'s plan would increase Ohio\'s cigarette tax from $1.60 a pack to $2.25 a pack and raise taxes on other tobacco products by an equivalent rate. The bill also calls for making vapor products, including e-cigarettes, subject to the tax.\nKasich\'s budget plan heads next to the Ohio House, which is set to begin deliberations in the coming days.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFqNsf0EZmLWkD6YKeh8b0ct8uOaw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779361767561&ei=wt2SWIjZGdfgWpGZtOgI&url=http://www.irontontribune.com/2017/01/31/gov-kasich-proposes-tax-changes/,EN,,02/02/2017 08:07,2017-01-31 14:05:00+00:00,8742bf891f,Ironton Tribune,,,,,1485875100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51151d7c1f,Do you have an abnormal heart rhythm? Yoga can help you - The Indian Express,"Do you have an abnormal heart rhythm? Yoga can help you\n\n\n								\n								By: IANS[1] | London | 		\n								 Published:March 15, 2016 2:51 pm\n								\n								\n												 During the study, yoga was performed for one hour, once a week, for 12 weeks in the hospital with an experienced instructor, which included light movements, deep breathing and meditation. (Source: IANS)\nYoga may improve quality of life in patients suffering from abnormal heart rhythm because it gives them a method to gain some self control over their symptoms instead of feeling helpless, says a new study.\nThe researchers examined the effects of yoga on patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) in which faulty electrical signals and rapid heart rate begin suddenly and then stop on their own. \""Many patients with paroxysmal AF can\'t live their lives as they want to - they refuse dinners with friends, concerts and travelling - because they are afraid of an AF episode occurring,\"" said one of the researchers Maria Wahlstrom from Sophiahemmet University in Sweden.\nAlso see: Step-by-step breakdown and health benefits of the Surya Namaskar[2]\n\""AF episodes are accompanied by chest pain, dyspnoea and dizziness,\"" added Wahlstrom in the study published in the European journal of cardiovascular nursing. These symptoms are unpleasant and patients feel anxious, worried and stressed that an AF episode would occur. AF is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder and has no cure, the researches pointed out. Patients with paroxysmal AF experience episodes of AF usually lasting less than 48 hours and stop by themselves, although in some patients they can last up to seven days.\nThe team included 80 patients with paroxysmal AF who were randomised to yoga or a control group that did not do yoga. Yoga was performed for one hour, once a week, for 12 weeks in the hospital with an experienced instructor, which included light movements, deep breathing and meditation. After 12 weeks, the yoga group had higher \""SF-36\"" mental health scores, lower heart rate and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure than the control group. \""We found that patients who did yoga had a better quality of life, lower heart rate and lower blood pressure than patients who did not do yoga. The breathing and movement may have beneficial effects on blood pressure,\"" Wahlstrom stated.\nAlso see: BKS Iyengar - He inspired through his yoga and his words[3] \n\""Patients in the yoga group said it felt good to let go of their thoughts and just be inside themselves for awhile,\"" Wahlstrom noted.\nFor news updates, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ & Instagram[4][5][6][7]\n								\n																\n								\n																	\n																\n							References^ IANS (news.google.com)^ Step-by-step breakdown and health benefits of the Surya Namaskar (indianexpress.com)^ BKS Iyengar - He inspired through his yoga and his words (indianexpress.com)^ Facebook (www.facebook.com)^ Twitter (twitter.com)^ Google+ (plus.google.com)^ Instagram (www.instagram.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGMlrg_gDU9rn8IZ9OEL9j2NA9MuQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779062830611&ei=62WxV7CxFNL1zAa99prwDQ&url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/do-you-have-an-abnormal-heart-rhythm-yoga-can-help-you/,EN,,15/08/2016 07:07,2016-03-15 08:21:32+00:00,9c87b5ffae,The Indian Express,,,,,1458033692,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

518ebe871f,Three projects receive grants for cattle well-being - GlobalMeatNews.com,"Cattle welfare grants announced\n\n\n                                                        In March 2018, Bayer launched its global Care4Cattle initiative in collaboration with the World Farmers\' Organisation (WFO). The aim of the initiative was to recognise and support innovative-thinking livestock professionals who have created new ways of advancing beef and dairy cattle well-being on the farm.Three projects have been selected to jointly receive the ?30,000 Care4Cattle grant funding.The initiative received more than 100 entries from across 37 countries, with the three winners from Australia, Brazil and the UK.Dr Dominique van der Saag from Australia was selected for her research into the ways in which calves could self-administer analgesia after standard husbandry procedures. Van der Saag and her team created medicated lick blocks, which allowed the animals to receive a constant level of pain relief.  Van der Saag said: \""The repeated handling and treatment of animals can be detrimental to their well-being, so self-administration of analgesia through, for example, medicated lick blocks, has the potential for extended pain relief at the same time as reducing the stress these animals may feel.\""?In Brazil, Professor Mateus Paranhos da Costa wants to study the effects different weaning methods can have on the well-being of beef calves. The study will monitor the weight gain of the calves throughout the process, and will be able to see the impact each method has on the overall well-being of the calf.Paranhos da Costa said: \""The weaning method commonly used on beef cattle farms in Brazil has a negative impact on the well-being and productivity of cows and calves.?\""With this project we aim to study the short and long-term effects of alternative weaning methods on cow-calf well-being and post-weaning performance.\""?The third winning submission was from The Cattle Lameness Academy in the UK. This team of veterinary experts educate and promote proactive discussions with farmers to help them tackle the problem of lameness in cattle. Their aim is to create a modular training platform using videos, where they can support farmers in dealing with the rising threat of lameness.Dr Reuben Newsome, one of the veterinarians running and developing The Cattle Lameness Academy, said: \""The future of lameness in cattle is very worrying and it has to change, for the benefit of cattle well-being and farm productivity. We hope to provide farmers with the knowledge and expertise to address and overcome the challenge of lameness, therefore maintaining their place in sustainable agriculture.\""?Dr Almut Hoffmann, head of farm animal products marketing at Animal Health, Bayer, said: \""Through ongoing commitment, innovation and collaboration, we can make significant contributions to enhancing animal well-being. Ensuring the well-being of animals is the right thing to do. And ultimately, what benefits the animals benefits all of us.\""?",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEbPqkvFhIevqPeeN8fcHrIWa9_ww&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=DJekW5CDGY-r-waq35DoAQ&url=https://www.globalmeatnews.com/Article/2018/09/20/Cattle-welfare-grants-announced,EN,,21/09/2018 07:00,2018-09-20 17:33:05+00:00,09f6823154,GlobalMeatNews.com,,,,,1537471985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

568a7ab996,How Debbie Reynolds Perfectly Voiced a Spider in Heartbreaking \'Charlotte\'s Web\' - Variety,"Debbie Reynolds Dead: How She Voiced a Spider in \'Charlotte\'s Web\'\n\n\n								\n								While Debbie Reynolds[1] was best known as a Hollywood singing and dancing icon - from \""Singin\' in the Rain\"" to \""The Unsinkable Molly Brown\"" - she also made a strong impression in children\'s programming. She voiced a grandmother in Nickelodeon\'s \""Rugrats,\"" and took on similar roles in Disney Channel\'s \""Kim Possible\"" and \""Halloweentown.\"" But to me, nothing compares to her aching and wistful performance as the star of Hanna-Barbera\'s 1973 animated \""Charlotte\'s Web.\""\nThe movie, the first adaptation of E.B. White\'s beloved children\'s novel, was met with lukewarm ticket sales, but received a renaissance in the \'90s thanks to its hugely popular VHS edition.\nI must have been in the first grade when I got to know Reynolds - before I\'d ever heard about her. As interpreted by Reynolds, Charlotte is everything the book character is and more: wise, maternal, sassy, didactic and endlessly protective of Wilbur the pig. Plus, she\'s a hell of a singer. It\'s such a masterful portrait, every time I\'ve read the story since then, I always hear Reynolds\' soothing cadence.\nJoe Barbera later revealed[2] that Reynolds was such a fan of the book, she offered to play the part for free. And her work paved the way for Julia Roberts as Charlotte in a live-action remake, released in 2006.\n\nYet, for all its charms, the 1973 \""Charlotte\'s Web\"" was a painful production that almost didn\'t make it. White, who resisted selling his book to Disney, protested about all the musical numbers. In 2003, illustrator Gene Deitch (\""Popeye\"") published his collection of letters[3] from the distressed author.\n\""In writing of a spider, I did not make the spider adapt her ways to my scheme,\"" White wrote. \""I spent a year studying spiders before I ever started writing the book. In this, I think I found the key to the story.

5919b16a01,Franklin Graham: Vote for the \'Least Heathen\' Candidate - PJ Media,"Franklin Graham: Vote for the \'Least Heathen\' Candidate\n\n\n            Franklin Graham: Vote for the \'Least Heathen\' Candidate\n  \n    \n            \n          \n   The Reverend Franklin Graham urged his fellow Christians to vote in November, even if they have to choose between two \""heathen\"" candidates. Son of the Reverend Billy Graham and president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Graham has taken on much of his father\'s mantle in the evangelical community.In an interview with CBN[1] in Denver this week, Graham stressed the importance of voting for all Christians.I don\'t care who wins and who\'s out there, you have to vote. And I\'m not going to tell people who to vote for, I\'m not going to do that -- let God tell you who to vote for. You may have to hold your nose, you may have to decide which is the least heathen of the two heathen.\""Graham did not specify which candidates he considered to be \""heathens,\"" but it seems likely he was referring to the current frontrunners in the Republican and Democratic parties. Republican Donald Trump claims to be a Christian, but he is well-known for boasting of sleeping with many women, for attempting to take an aged widow\'s house to build a limousine parking lot[2], and for repeating on television that he does not remember asking God for forgiveness[3].Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton is not much better. After Hillary attempted to silence a woman who claimed to be sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton[4], she later declared that every survivor of sexual assault has \""a right to be heard.\"" A former Obama intelligence chief even called for Hillary to bow out of the presidential race[5] due to her email scandal, which Hillary claims is a \""routine checkup\"" by the FBI. No wonder Americans don\'t trust her.Following the violence and protest at Trump rallies earlier this month, the Reverend Franklin Graham declared America spiritually and morally broken[6]. \""This past week we saw violent protests at political rallies,\"" he wrote. \""One candidate is under investigation by the FBI. Another candidate says we need a political revolution. What America needs is a godly revolution.\"" These partially veiled references to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders left two notable gaps. In his lament, Graham did not mention Ted Cruz or John Kasich.Cruz has attended many of evangelical organizer David Lane\'s Issachar trainings[7], which aim to equip pastors to run for political office this year. Lane has said his organization, the American Renewal Project, has trained over 500 pastors so far.In an email statement to PJ Media, Lane declared that \""Ted Cruz knows Christ,\"" while \""Donald Trump, like us, you and me, needs Christ.\"" In a scathing rebuke of the other party, he declared, \""I don\'t see how a democrat who presses for abortion and same-sex intercourse and marriage would line up with \'biblical principles.\'\""Next Page: Franklin Graham\'s Change in Tone -- Calling Christians to Support the Most Godly candidate, now the Least Heathen.\n      \n        \n          https://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/03/18/franklin-graham-vote-for-the-least-heathen-candidate/\n        \n      \n        \n  References^ interview with CBN (www1.cbn.com)^ take an aged widow\'s house to build a limousine parking lot (pjmedia.com)^ does not remember asking God for forgiveness (pjmedia.com)^ attempted to silence a woman who claimed to be sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton (pjmedia.com)^ bow out of the presidential race (pjmedia.com)^ spiritually and morally broken (m.christianpost.com)^ many of evangelical organizer David Lane\'s Issachar trainings (pjmedia.com)\n#datearemp\n#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH893Bol2yeSrthTZw_6t4iIhZBdA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779064811723&ei=q1nuVuCsOoHBaq_toiA&url=https://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/03/18/franklin-graham-vote-for-the-least-heathen-candidate/,EN,,20/03/2016 08:07,2016-03-18 16:56:23+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,PJ Media,,,,,1458323783,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of the pastors lead mega-churches. In the meeting, the pastors said very complimentary things about the president. \nPastor Darrell Scott from Cleveland said President Trump is the \""most pro-black president I\'ve seen in my lifetime.\"" \""The president actually wants to prove something to our community, our faith-based community and our ethnic community,\"" Scott said. \""The last president [Obama] didn\'t feel like he had to. ... He got a pass.\""\nRev. Phillip Goudeaux of Calvary Christian Center in Sacramento, California, a spiritual adviser to the family of Stephon Clark (the black suspect who was fatally shot March 18 by two police officers), praised Trump as well, saying the president restored \""hope\"" to the community. \nPastors Scott and Goudeaux came under fire from critics who claim Trump\'s policies have harmed the black community. As did the Rev. John Gray, head of Relentless Church in Greenville, South Carolina. He appeared on CNN with Don Lemon (aka \""the dumbest man on television\"") and was chastised for meeting with Trump.\nDozens of black pastors signed an open letter criticizing the black pastors who met with the president. I\'ve interviewed many of these critics on my radio show, and they\'re all radical leftists. They love Barack Obama. They hate whites, they\'re anti-police and they\'re pro-abortion. They are some of the most corrupt people around; wolves in sheep\'s clothing.\nRev. Jamal Bryant called the Trump meeting \""a stain on the body of Christ.\"" Bryant preaches at Baltimore\'s Empowerment Temple AME Church. He works closely with Al Sharpton. He\'s an anti-police activist who marches with Black Lives Matter and defends thugs. Bryant also reportedly cheated on his ex-wife and fathered at least one child out of wedlock. \nThese people are socialist, Communist pigs who don\'t care about blacks. They\'re pawns of the elite socialist-wing of the Democratic Party. They want blacks stuck on the Democrat\'s plantation addicted to failed government programs which have laid waste to black families and railroaded black progress. \nOrder Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson\'s book, \""The Antidote: Healing America from the Poison of Hate, Blame, and Victimhood.\""\nWhile Obama was pushing \""criminal justice reform\"" and dividing the races with lies for eight years, blacks lost ground in every major economic category. Yet liberal black pastors and corrupt establishment black \""leaders\"" continue to promote the lie that Obama was good for blacks - he wasn\'t. \nChristians shouldn\'t adopt the left\'s godless agenda. Criminal justice or prison reform is a liberal issue. Trying to get President Trump to focus on this issue won\'t help blacks one iota. Perhaps, some of the sentencing guidelines need to be looked at to make sure punishment for minor drug offenses are fair, but get-out-of-jail-free cards aren\'t the solution. \nWe need to address the real pressing problems plaguing the black community. Out-of-wedlock births, anger, drug addiction, crime and violence, failing public schools and the lack of job training are crucial. \nBlacks are in a dire situation. According to the Pew Research Center, crime rates in America have dropped steadily in the last 20 years, but the homicide rate in Democrat-run, predominantly black cities is skyrocketing. \nBlack women are aborting their babies at an alarming rate. Induced abortion is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and accounts for a disturbing 61 percent of deaths of blacks, according to researchers from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \nThe Trump presidency is truly the last chance for blacks to get on the right course. The economy is booming and blacks - and all Americans have more opportunities to get ahead. As a result, a recent Rasmussen poll indicates that black support for Trump rose from 15 percent to 29 percent!\nBlacks\' issue is not \""racism\"" or white people. Their problem started with the resentment and anger toward their failing parents. Seventy-seven percent of black American children are born out of wedlock. These children are being raised in awful conditions without fathers. Blacks need to drop their anger so they can wake up to reality that the Democratic Party and their \""leaders\"" don\'t care about them. If blacks don\'t see through the lies and propaganda, they will miss out on their last opportunity to get out of their sh*t-hole condition.\nThere is a spiritual revival happening in the country. And President Trump should continue to take his message directly to the people. He doesn\'t have to go through so-called \""leaders\"" to reach blacks. \nSince the election of Trump, I hear from blacks who are waking up - especially from Millennials. The revival isn\'t happening in the church. People are finding alternative voices and they\'re being awakened by the truth. The Republican Party needs to reach these young people and make sure they turn out to vote.\nIt\'s time for blacks to choose good or evil, life or death. The choice is up to them, but time is running out. \nJesse Lee Peterson has declared August as \""Men\'s History Month\"" - a time to recognize and appreciate the contributions of good men.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGjqqDR2fRA9IHtw38qHAH4uLQm3A&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779993175181&ei=2_NnW8CxLo_6zAae_LrYAg&url=https://www.wnd.com/2018/08/choose-black-america-good-or-evil/,EN,,06/08/2018 07:05,2018-08-05 22:23:25+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,WND.com,,,,,1533515005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we know that this is not an isolated situation - similar scenes can be witnessed on farms across the UK.\n\nOn factory farms[2], animals are treated as walking pieces of meat, whose only purpose is to generate profit for farmers. It\'s standard practice to keep intelligent, curious pigs indoors in dark sheds for their entire short lives, to mutilate them without painkillers (for example, by cutting off their tails) and to confine mother pigs to farrowing crates so small that they can\'t turn around before they give birth.\nThe best way to help these animals is to stop paying for this cruelty.

5d02080aff,Politician: Kill Disabled Children Like We Kill Deformed Lambs - LifeNews.com,"Politician: Kill Disabled Children Like We Kill Deformed Lambs\n\n\n                                                You might recall that British politician, Colin Brewer, who last year said that disabled children should be killed to save taxpayer money[1]. You might recall that at the time he apologized and stepped down in disgrace. But you probably didn\'t know that he was re-elected to his old seat this year. And he\'s at it again.\nThis time, he reportedly compared disabled children to deformed lambs that need to be culled. In an interview with none other than the Disability News Service, Councillor (yeah, they spell it that way) Brewer said that perhaps we should be treating disabled children like the runt of a litter of lambs which are often disposed of by smashing them against the wall.\n\'If they have a misshapen lamb, they get rid of it,\"" he said. \""They get rid of it. Bang.\""\nBang? That\'s sound fiscal policy, huh? And that\'s what it is, according to Brewer. He said that disabled people are just too expensive to care for so some may just have to go.\n\""We are just animals,\"" Brewer continued. \""You can\'t have lambs running around with five legs and two heads. It would be put down, smashed against the wall and be dealt with.\"" I always love when people say humans are just animals because the next sentence out of their mouths usually goes a long way toward proving it.\nWhen asked if there was any difference between killing a lamb or a human being he simply said, according to Disability News, \""I think the cost has got to be evaluated.\""\n\""It is not something I would like to do but there is only so much in the bucket,\"" he reportedly said. \""If you are talking about giving services to the community or services to the individual, the balance has got to be struck.\""\nBalance? If anyone here seems imbalanced, it\'s those who voted for Brewer. I\'d be interested in asking him and anyone who supported him how much is the price tag on a human life? When caring costs, what\'s the limit?\nNow, you might just say that it\'s just one crazy old dude so who cares. But here\'s the thing - he was just re-elected earlier this month to his old seat. That means that being pro-infanticide and culling the disabled is no longer a deal breaker in European politics. Sure, he may be eccentric but he\'s just fighting to keep taxes down, right? And if there\'s a fiscal problem it\'s not really a fiscal problem at all, it\'s just a wall shortage. Because remember, every fiscal disaster is just an opportunity to cull.\nAnd who is the enemy? Those who stand between them and the wall.\nAnd please don\'t think that it\'s just a European thing. We all just went through the Kermit Gosnell trial and the Live Action videos that showed killing babies outside the womb may not be s rare as we were led to believe.\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\'RE PRO-LIFE[2]!\n\n\n\n \nDr. Ezekiel Emanuel who acted as a special health advisor to President Obama, reportedly said in 1996: \""Conversely, services provided to individuals who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed.\""\nWho judges who is a participant, I wonder? And how much participation is warranted for treatment?\nNew Hampshire\'s Martin Harty, a freshman state legislator, resigned from office after saying he wished \""defective people\"" could be exiled and left to die in Siberia. Still unclear if he understood that Siberia is not in the U.S. but geography is not really the main problem here, is it?\nAnd who can forget that just a few years ago Supreme Court Justice Ruth Vader Ginsburg told the New York Times that \""at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don\'t want to have too many of.\""\nTwo questions arise. Who is the \""we\"" and who are those we don\'t want to have too many of.\nNo position is so radical in the 21st century as the radical commitment to love. No belief is so derided as the belief that every life is sacred. Maybe it has always been this way. Maybe it always will be.

Freedom from violence is reproductive freedom ... We stand with communities affirming that #BlackLivesMatter.\""\nQuestioning Planned Parenthood\'s stand for black lives\nPointing out the irony behind Planned Parenthood\'s newly declared concern for black lives, one conservative columnist took the opportunity to challenge the taxpayer-funded entity to put an end to its mass killings of preborn black babies - a prompt it was encouraged to carry out if it really stands behind its message that \""black lives matter.\""\n\""Planned Parenthood is one of the greatest perpetrators of violence against African Americans in this country,\"" D.C. McAllister wrote in The Federalist[3]. \""It\'s founded on racism, perpetuates racism and kills more than 850 African Americans every day.\""\nShe then addressed an issue that often evokes silence from Planned Parenthood - that it targets the black community with its abortion operations across America.\n\""Black people make up about 13 percent of the population, yet comprise 37 percent of all abortions,\"" McAllister informed. \""Black women are 4.8 times more likely to have an abortion than white women are. Approximately 78 percent of Planned Parenthood\'s clinics are in minority communities, and black babies are three times more likely to be killed from an abortion than white babies.\""\nA challenge to Parenthood was soon to follow:\n\""Clearly, if anyone should \'stop killing black people,\' it\'s Planned Parenthood,\"" McAllister asserted. \""The real violence against minorities in America isn\'t on the streets of Charlotte or any other city - it\'s in the clinics of Planned Parenthood.\""\nLet the truth be known\nIn addition to McAllister\'s challenge, black pastors, including Reverend Dr. Clenard H. Childress, Jr., along with other pro-life leaders, are calling out Planned Parenthood\'s hypocrisy[4]. As the founder of Blackgenocide.org[5], Childress made a recent appeal to African Americans to recognize Planned Parenthood as the wolf in sheep\'s clothing in black communities across the nation.\n\""Now I say to all Americans - but especially and in particular to my African American Brothers and Sisters (of which I am one) - \'Will you ever recognize this conspiracy against you?\'\""Childress posed last month[6]. \""For the leading killer of innocent unarmed African Americans - whose hands were up, but given no choice nor chance at the American Dream their fellow African American, Dr. Martin Luther King preached about - is Planned Parenthood!\""\nIt is also argued that Planned Parenthood\'s flagrant disregard for the sanctity of life can be witnessed through its treatment of black women themselves.\n\""Unborn babies are not the only ones losing their lives at Planned Parenthood\'s abortion facilities,\"" LifeNews\' Micaiah Bilger argues. \""In 2014, Planned Parenthood was forced to pay a $2 million settlement[7] to the family of a black woman named Tonya Reaves who died from a botched abortion at one of its Illinois facilities in 2012.

5e7025c469,Time Was: History might just repeat itself in a park - Salisbury Post,"Time Was: History might just repeat itself in a park\n\n\n											By ClydeFor the Salisbury Post\nTime was we had a town common. Once upon a time, there was a place right in the middle of town for everyone. That place was Salisbury, our town, and it wasn\'t that long ago. No, it was not last night, but it was here before there was an Old Sarum art gallery and a New Sarum Brewery. You can touch a stone from the Salisbury Cathedral - yes, England - if you go to the chapel at Catawba and look just inside the front door on the right wall.\nWhen Mr. Innes and Mr. Corbin laid out the town in squares in 1755, they left a place for the people. As \""it was customary to have a \'common\' or open tract of public land in their immediate vicinity, where the cattle might graze at will, where the children might play, and the gatherings of the citizens be held on extraordinary occasions.\""\n\""Its precise locality appears to be lying on each side of the Western Great Road leading through the frontiers of this province.\"" This was Beattie\'s Ford Road crossing Grants Creek at the bridge near the head of McCay\'s pond, Milford Hills, leaving Corbin Street with Temple Street, running diagonally through the square occupied by the late Dr. W. Hall, and back of the residence of M.L. Holmes.\nThe \""common\"" on each side of the road would include the square now occupied by the grounds of the Presbyterian manse, and the spring that was anciently on it, as well as the spring starting behind Paul Heilig\'s and running through the grounds of the National Cemetery covered with small oaks and chinquapin bushes.\""\nThis is serendipitously exactly the site of a proposed park for downtown, along the Henderson-library land down to Helig\'s field. Imagine the pastoral landscapes of a meadow - with a few grazing cows, just perfect for our Plein-Air artists\' brushwork. History might just repeat itself, soon, thank you Julian and Blanche.\nAnd once again, thanks to one common man - another flourishes. It is the gifts of benevolence that keep us alive and above the curve while sluggards are happy being \""as common as pig tracks.\""\nOther towns are not so lucky.\n\""It is a matter of profound astonishment,\"" Jethro Rumple wrote in 1896,  \""that towns will part with grounds that would make desirable parks or breathing places, for a mere trifle and condemn the citizens to live in a long unbroken line of houses, unrelieved by shade, when they might so easily retain a common or park, where the inhabitants might resort, at will, in summer weather, and refresh themselves by breathing the pure air that comes whispering through the rustling leaves of the trees. It is difficult in larger towns to escape from the dust and glare of the streets and painted houses into a pleasant shady retreat...\"".\nOur town commissioners, who were elected for lifetime terms, had the foresight to plan for whomever would come after them. With a sense of togetherness and a trust that was built on the past, shared with the present and kept for the future. What do our city leaders have \'in common\' with the founding fathers?\nA community is defined as people living together under the same laws, in the same district, having interests, work, etc. in common. A similarity or likeness? What part of that have we lost? Would that we share our commons with our diversity. Look towards a utopian settlement with a united front and our best foot forward. \nEnough tearing down, undermining virtues, finger pointing at our elders - no tweets, twitter or twits. Instead, compliment the good, the beautifier, doctors of good health, providers of good food, builders of a warm home and uncommon fortunes - along with our God-given rights. Things that not everyone has or has the opportunity to share with those who do not have.\n\""The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.\"" - Job 1:21\nClyde is a Salisbury artist.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGXKmdq7EyLhgheRUZaHCAJ-XUxFQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=k4NtWvD6OoSXW-GEg7gJ&url=http://www.salisburypost.com/2018/01/28/time-was-history-might-just-repeat-itself-in-a-park/,EN,,28/01/2018 08:00,2018-01-28 04:02:43+00:00,51fe179e08,Salisbury Post,,,,,1517115763,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69b434967b,"Since Auburn boy is allergic to cats and dogs, family makes goats its pet project - Kennebec Journal & Morning Sentinel","Since Auburn boy is allergic to cats and dogs, family makes goats its pet project\n\n\nAUBURN - When it became clear that Gabriel Munroe was deathly allergic to cats and dogs, he and his family were devastated.\nThey found new homes for two dogs and three cats, but Gabriel, then 5, needed some kind of pet. A tank full of saltwater fish? Nice, but not the same.\nThen his allergist suggested something more unconventional: goats.\n\""I\'m like, \'Oh, my God, I\'ve never had a goat in my life,\' \"" said mom Heidi Campbell. \""So we had to do some research.\""\nFour years later, the Auburn family has more goats than people - five, including three baby Nigerian dwarf goats who moved in last month.\n\""They play with you. You can snuggle them,\"" said Gabriel, now 9, leading the trio of bouncing, bleating kids into their play yard. \""They\'re fuzzy. And cute.\""\nThe grown-up goats are Edmund and Antonio. The 4-month-olds are Oscar, Nibbles and Julian Edelman - the last named after the New England Patriots wide receiver.\nAll five came from Gabriel\'s allergist, who also happens to be a goat farmer.\n\""It was fun. It was kind of crazy. We were totally flying by the seat of our pants as far as learning what they needed. At least I was, anyway,\"" Campbell said. \""My husband is a vet, so he has some experience with some of these animals.\""\nThe goats have their own personalities. Nibbles - aptly named - delights in chewing on any human clothing within reach. Antonio likes to roughhouse. Edmund is friendly.\n\""He acts more like a dog than anything else. He\'ll walk up to you just for attention. He\'ll slobber your face,\"" said dad Alex Munroe, as Edmund leaned against his legs.\nJust like dogs, the goats wear collars - Edmund and Antonio get \""Star Wars\"" - and they walk on leashes. They can learn tricks, including \""shake hands.\""\nAnd, like dogs and so many other pets, they like to be the center of attention.\n\""I am ...\"" Gabriel started to say.\n\""Baa!\"" Julian interrupted.\n\""Trying to ...\""\n\""Baa!\""\n\""Make a conversation!\""\n\""Baa!\""\nBut while the goats are cute and fun, and they don\'t affect Gabriel\'s allergies, there are drawbacks. They can be destructive, including, but not limited to, tearing the siding off their barn. They go to the bathroom a lot and all over the place, and traditional pooper-scoopers do not work well on goat dung. And they need specialized medical care.\nEven Munroe, who works with cats, dogs and exotic animals at the Forest Avenue Veterinary Hospital in Portland and the Animal Emergency Clinic of Mid-Maine in Lewiston, doesn\'t feel comfortable handling anything but minor issues for his family\'s goats. Bigger problems need an area vet who specializes in large animals and livestock.\nStill, the family said, the goats are worth it.\n\""We love them,\"" Campbell said.\nThe goats aren\'t the only animals in Gabriel\'s life now. He also has three tanks filled with fish, plus nine hermit crabs, 12 chickens and two horses.\nHowever, the goats are his favorite.\n\n\n\n\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors. \n\n< Previous\n\nNext >",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGppRrVtm9EGntgPsQF7ULT-CQU0A&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=YgGqW8CNOoOH6QTw0YeQCQ&url=https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/09/23/since-auburn-boy-is-allergic-to-cats-and-dogs-family-makes-goats-its-pet-project/,EN,,25/09/2018 09:35,2018-09-23 23:13:56+00:00,5b41d61294,Kennebec Journal & Morning Sentinel,,,,,1537751636,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
718da9b5bf,Unleashing catastrophe - Mayo News,"Unleashing catastrophe - The Mayo News\n\nTO THE SLAUGHTER?Lambs and sheep are defenseless against dogs that are let run loose by irresponsible owners.Country Sights and SoundsJohn ShelleyWhen James\'s friend came to visit he brought with him a pair of city hounds. Being raised on the streets as they were, these were totally bereft of manners and decorum and uneducated in the ways of the country. What rich scents they found at the lakeside! Whereas their nostrils had formerly been filled with only what could be gleaned from lamp posts and trees in the park, which unpleasant odours would consist almost entirely of the fouling of other dogs, here they were suddenly exposed to the scents and smells of the real world. It struck me that the blind man of Bethsaida could hardly have expressed greater surprise at having Christ open his eyes than this pair of mutts did when confronted with the forest floor for the first time in their grubby little lives.Their first reaction was one of fear. One cowered behind its master\'s legs, while the other was quite taken aback by the wide vista the open lake offered, and stood quite still, almost with its mouth open in disbelief. Then gradually the two of them began to quiver their nostrils. One ran a short distance before giving reluctant heed to the command barked by James. The second took off in the other direction, and when efforts were made to retrieve this individual, the first disappeared into the briars.I wasn\'t bothered. \""They\'ll come back when they\'re hungry.\""James was less certain. \""There\'s lambs in the field beyond. If they get wind of them there\'ll be trouble.\""\""What do you mean?\"" his city friend asked with alarm in his voice.\""If those dogs get in among the sheep...,\"" James paused with dark meaning, and then with a hint of reproach in his voice, \""You oughtn\'t to have let them off like that, not really.\"" \""They\'re not dogs. They\'re pedigree hounds,\"" said his friend, defensively. \""And I didn\'t let them off - they just went.\""\""Whatever they are they won\'t be for long, not if we don\'t get them back.\"" And so began an afternoon of scurrying about and hunting. We hurried in the direction that one of the dogs had taken, although both James and I knew this would be a useless tactic. Once on the trail of deer or hare, that dog could change direction a dozen times in as many moments. The scent of badger or fox would at least lead it to the sett or den, and we knew where these were.We stopped to listen and heard distant crashing through undergrowth, followed by the thrumming of padded feet. A brindled form rushed past.\""Billy! Billeee!\"" shouted the townsman, as he broke into a gallop in pursuit of his pet.\""Oh no,\"" groaned James. \""If we lose him as well we\'ll be out here all day.\"" But there was no point in rushing. With a couple of hundred acres of woodland to run about in, those dogs could keep themselves entertained indefinitely. It might be better if we walked as far as the sheep field, and at least keep an eye open there.As we did, James explained the law regarding dogs that start worrying sheep. \""There\'s thousands of sheep get killed by dogs every year, and mostly in the spring when there\'s lambs about. Once a dog gets a taste of blood there\'s no stopping it. It\'d run right through you as if you weren\'t there.\""\""But those two wouldn\'t harm a fly,\"" his friend protested.\""And why do you think they\'ve taken off chasing after things? Do they want to make friends with the wildlife? Is that what you think?\""We reached the field gate and looked in to where the sheep were grazing peacefully and undisturbed. About half of the ewes had lambs; the rest were heavily pregnant.James asked the question. \""If they were your animals and a stranger\'s dogs were chasing them about and tearing at them, what would you do?\""His friend paused and thought. \""I don\'t know. What could you do?\""\""I\'ll tell you,\"" said James. \""There\'s a little implant you can get, goes just behind the dog\'s ear. Once that\'s in it\'ll never chase sheep again. It\'s made of lead, and it\'s put in from a distance, with a twelve bore.\""\""They wouldn\'t...\""\""They would.\"" said James emphatically.And they would indeed. We did get those dogs back, eventually. Unfortunately, they will not be the only ones out there. Sheep-worrying is catastrophic for everybody, dog owners and sheep farmers alike. Take care out there.

740fb1b5be,UPDATED: North Carolina GOP Scrambles to Save Pig Stink - Mother Jones,"UPDATED: North Carolina GOP Scrambles to Save Pig Stink\n\nUPDATE: 5/10/2017: The North Carolina House voted 74-40[1] to override Gov. Roy Cooper\'s veto of a bill designed to protect hog farms from nuisance lawsuits. The bill now goes to the NC Senate. \""Big Pork had a big day in the state house, as it snatched away the ability for residents to obtain fair compensation for damage to their homes and health from the animal waste of factory farms,\"" Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement[2]. \n\nLast week, North Carolina\'s newly elected Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, vetoed a bill that would have shielded the state\'s massive industry pork industry against nuisance lawsuits from residents who live near massive hog operations. As I teased out in this post[3], the facilities foul air and water and make life miserable for neighbors, mainly in areas with sizeable black and Native American populations.\n\nBut the North Carolina Republican Party-author of such legislative triumphs as the \""bathroom bill\"" and its \""even worse\"" replacement[4]-has sufficient votes in both chambers of the legislature to override a gubernatorial veto. Cheered on[5] by the North Carolina Pork Council, the House has scheduled a vote Wednesday to do just that, reports[6] the Greensboro News and Record. If it passes, the override legislation would then go to the state Senate-which has already worked with the House[7] to override a Cooper veto in this legislation session.\n\nA recent analysis of satellite data[8] by Environmental Working Group found that around 160,000 North Carolinians live within a half mile of an industrial-scale hog operation or an open cesspool filled with waste from one. An analysis of campaign-finance records by the Durham-based weekly IndyWeek[9] found that the politicians pushing the legislation have been heavily funded by donors associated with Smithfield, the globe\'s biggest pork company, which dominates pork production in North Carolina.

Sign up for our new Morning Report weekday newsletter[1].\nPolice didn\'t provide a crowd count but organizers expected some 50,000 participants. A similar event last week in Los Angeles drew 35,000 people.\nThere was a strong police presence at the San Francisco march. At one point marchers were met by several hundred counter-demonstrators but there was no violence.\nMarchers had been urged to follow a code of conduct to maintain a \""peaceful and prayerful attitude\"" that included avoiding confrontations with counter-protesters and not carrying signs with graphic abortion images.\nA Roman Catholic Mass and a rally at Civic Center Plaza preceded the march.\nSpeakers expressed optimism in light of President Donald Trump\'s support for their cause voiced in an address last week to the March for Life demonstration in Washington, D.C.\nTrump supports a bill in the Senate that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, although it has little chance of passage.\nSpeakers took a distinctly religious bent, with some referring to abortion providers as demonic and evil.\n\""They have adopted falsehood,\"" said Joseph Scheidler of the Pro-Life Action League. \""They kill innocent, defenseless human beings.\""\nOthers argued that abortion was a women\'s health issue.\n\""We\'re here to proclaim that abortion hurts women.

7a64f8c45d,Shane Ray busts out for Broncos with three? - The Denver Post,"Shane Ray busts out for Broncos with three sacks; Andy Dalton\'s plan fizzles; Jeff Heuerman debuts\n\n\n			CINCINNATI - Shane Ray carried the weight of high expectations through his rookie season after the Broncos drafted him in the first round last year. Early in his second season, he just wanted an opportunity. And after veteran DeMarcus Ware broke his arm in a game last week, it was Ray\'s turn to shine.\nThe second-year outside linebacker steamrolled to a career-best game, sacking Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton three times in the Broncos\' 29-17 victory at Paul Brown Stadium. With Cincinnati ahead by two in the third quarter, Ray sacked Dalton twice on back-to-back plays, pushing the Bengals out of field-goal range.\nThe Bengals set their sights on strongside linebacker Von Miller, using double teams and extra attention to keep him away from Dalton. That left Ray on the weak side to stretch out.\n\""They tried to block me one-on-one with a tight end. I don\'t think that\'s a good idea,\"" Ray said.\nWith less than two minutes remaining, as the Bengals grew desperate, Ray sacked Dalton again on a first down. Miller followed with another on the next play.\n\""Everybody was looking to see what I would do with D-Ware being gone. I wanted to step up,\"" Ray said.\nDalton Plan. Dalton entered Sunday with a league-high 732 passing yards. He was allowed only 206 against the Broncos and their secondary.\n\""He had 100 yards before the last drive,\"" cornerback Chris Harris said. \""So really, we kept him under 100. But that was our guy. We want to continue to play smash-mouth defense. They ran the ball a little bit on us, but we were able to shut them down on the pass.\""\nSafety Will Parks, who filled in for T.J. Ward when Ward exited briefly with a neck injury, said the team\'s practice and last week prepared them for the moment.\n\""We didn\'t beat them today; we beat them on Tuesday,\"" Parks said. \""We went out there and we just practiced hard Wednesday, practiced hard Thursday, practiced hard Friday, and then put all of the finishing touches on. We came out and finished strong.\""\nHeuerman firsts. Jeff Heuerman made his regular-season debut not far from where he starred in college, at Ohio State. The second-year tight end missed all of 2015 with a knee injury and had a delayed start this season because of hamstring and ankle injuries.\nHis return was crucial, as the Broncos were without starting tight end Virgil Green (calf), and he made his presence felt. Heuerman\'s first catch was a 29-yarder in the fourth quarter that helped to set up a game-sealing touchdown pass to John Phillips.\nInjured, inactive. Outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware (forearm), offensive tackle Donald Stephens (calf) and tight end Virgil Green (calf) stayed in Colorado to rehabilitate  from their injuries. Joining them on Denver\'s inactive list were rookie safety Justin Simmons, who fractured his left wrist against Indianapolis; quarterback Austin Davis; cornerback Lorenzo Doss; and offensive lineman Connor McGovern.\nDuring the game, safety T.J. Ward (neck) and offensive tackle Russell Okung (back) left briefly with injuries but later returned. Coach Gary Kubiak said after the game both were OK.\nFootnotes. The Broncos improved to 3-0 - and 76 percent of teams that have started 3-0 reached the playoffs... Broncos coach Gary Kubiak is 7-0 in his career against Bengals coach Marvin Lewis...

7d520a9d81,Real Welfare report provides benchmark for pig industry - FG Insight,"Real Welfare report provides benchmark for pig industry - News\n\nNews02 Mar 2017 Angela CalvertTHE pig industry\'s first Real Welfare report published today (Thursday March 2) has been produced using of three years worth of data generated by the AHDB Pork Real Welfare scheme. Angela Calvert reports.\n				\n\n					\n							\r\n										\r\n							\n							\r\n										\r\n							\n					\n				\n			\n					\n						Share This\n						\n							\n								\n								\n							\n							 Real Welfare report provides benmark for pig industry #pig #welfare\n						\n						 USING data collected by the Real Welfare scheme from 2013-2016 the Real Welfare report aims to provide a credible, benchmarked level of pig welfare at both an industry and individual farm level.\nThe Real Welfare scheme was developed in response to the pig industry\'s need for strong, science-based evidence to demonstrate its husbandry standards to retailers, animal welfare lobby groups, policy makers and consumers.\nSince the start of the scheme more 5.5 million pigs have been individually assessed which represents 17.5 per cent of pigs slaughtered in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Database Mick Sloyan, AHDB Pork Strategy director says: \""We now have the biggest database of this kind in the world. No other country has made such a commitment to pig welfare. Its power is in the farmer-vet partnership approach and the fact that the industry voluntarily chose to do this.\n\""Producers benefit because it gives them objective data which enables them work constructively with their vet to focus on areas of improvement. It also enables to them benchmark their businesses against other similar farms.\n\""From an AHDB and industry perspective the results are very encouraging. The report on data to date is a solid benchmark as to where we are now as an industry and highlights key issues and areas where there is room for improvement. It is an evidence base that the industry can work from and measure positive change in the future with the plan being to produce a report annually.\""   Improvement issues are discussed and agreed between vets and farmers.  The Real Welfare Scheme The Real Welfare scheme gathers standardised information from pig farms on a mix of \'iceberg indicators\' of health and welfare to provide an evidence based approach to assess welfare from an animal\'s perspective. \nIt involves on-farm assessments using a set of five objective and repeatable measures which are known as \'welfare outcomes. They are animal-based, meaning that they are obtained from the animals themselves, rather than from their environment. \n \nThe measures are:\n \nHospital pigs\nLameness\nTail damage\nBody marks\nEnvironmental enrichment Real Welfare assessments Are carried out by vets who are members of the Pig Veterinary Society as part of the quarterly veterinary visits.\rAny agreed course of action is recorded in the farm\'s Veterinary Health Plan and becomes auditable by the Farm Assurance auditors.\rA sample of pigs, from a range of pens is assessed on each visit. The total number assessed per year depends on how many finisher places a farm has.\rAssessments are mandatory for all those who finish pigs under the Red Tractor Farm Assurance Pigs Standard which covers 95 per cent of all commercial pigs produced in the UK.\rAssessment outcomes are discussed between the veterinarian and farmer, which enables individual opportunities for improvement to be identified and acted upon.\rIt allows farmers to benchmark their welfare outcomes against other similar farms.\rWhere there is scope for improvement the issues are discussed and agreed between the vet and farmer and recorded in the farm\'s Veterinary Health Plan. Execution of these recommendations is audited annually.\rKEY FINDINGS OF THE PIG WELFARE REPORTHospitalisation Of those pigs not already in hospital pens seven out of 10,000 pigs needed hospitalisation. On more than 75 per cent of farms no pigs needed hospitalisation.\n \nThe percentage of pigs that benefited from being in a hospital pen, but were not already, was significantly lower every year. Lameness On average 18 out of 10,000 non-hospitalised pigs were lame. On more than 75 per cent of farms there were no non-hospitalised lame pigs. The percentage of lame pigs that were not already in a hospital pen was significantly lower every year. Tail damage  On average, 14 out of 10,000 pigs had severe tail damage; 134 out of 10,000 had visible tail damage; At least 24 per cent of pigs had undocked tails and 70 per cent of pigs had their tails docked. The remaining 6 per cent were kept in pens with mixed tail lengths\n \nMore than 75 per cent of farms had no pigs with severe tail damage and more than 50 per cent of farms had no pigs with visible mild tail damage.\n \nThere was an increase in the percentage of assessed pigs with severe tail damage in 2014 and 2015, although there is some evidence that this increase was not sustained in 2016.\n \nPig farmers evidently deal with pigs with tail damage well. Although absolute levels are relatively low, the trends in the annual figures highlight that addressing tail damage must remain a priority for the industry. Body marks On average, 26 out of 10,000 pigs had severe body marks and 11 out of 100 pigs had mild body marks.\n \nMore than 75 per cent of farms had no pigs with severe body marks and 50 per cent of farms had fewer than 7 out of 100 pigs with mild body marks.\n \nFollowing an increase in the percentage of non-hospitalised pigs with severe body marks in 2014, data from 2015 and 2016 shows a significant decrease. The overall low levels of severe body marks indicate that the physical and social environment is in order and farmers deal with pigs with severe body marks well.  Environmental enrichment On average 62 per cent of pigs had access to substrate, most of which was straw, 32 per cent of pigs had access to objects and 4 per cent of pigs had access to both substrate and objects.\n \nOver time, the enrichment ratios increased, meaning that the provided enrichment was perceived as becoming more attractive in the years after 2013.Although figures are going up all the time there is scope for improvement. Provision of effective environmental enrichment remains important for the industry and it is noteworthy that both provision of substrate and object enrichment has increased significantly since 2013.

7f39202905,Hunt For The Wilderpeople review - Den of Geek UK,"Hunt For The Wilderpeople review - a delightful adventure comedy\n\n\n       There was probably a grittier, more tersely-written version of Hunt For The Wilderpeople, based on the novel Wild Pork And Watercress by the best-selling New Zealand author, Barry Crump. But rather than try to emulate Crump\'s spare, masculine storytelling, writer-director Taika Waititi gently bends the town to his own quirky sensibility.\nThe result is another film about misunderstood outsiders from the filmmaker behind such brilliantly offbeat comedies as Eagle Vs Shark and What We Do In The Shadows; in Waititi\'s hands, Hunt For The Wilderpeople becomes an eccentric outdoors adventure with welcome splashes of laugh-out-loud comedy. It\'s like a blend of Waititi\'s 2010 hit Boy and 1982 Stallone joint, First Blood - with maybe a bit of Harold And Maude and Thelma And Louise thrown in for good measure.\nJulian Dennison plays Ricky Baker, a disadvantaged, overweight city kid who\'s sent to live with a pair of foster parents in the middle of nowhere. Julian soon forges a bond with the blunt yet kind Auntie Bella (Rima Te Wiata), but remains firmly on the wrong side of his foster uncle, Hec (Sam Neill), who comes lumbering out of the bush with a rifle in his hand and a dead boar slung over his shoulders. Ricky likes Tupac Shakur and writing sweary haikus. Uncle Hec just wants to be left alone in his shed. It\'s hardly an ideal pairing.\nA series of unfortunate events see Ricky and Hec stuck out in the hilly badlands of New Zealand with a gung-ho social worker, Paula (Rachel House), a bunch of redneck hunters and, incongruously, what appears to be a SWAT team on their trail. Amid all the adversity and flailing attempts at survival, Ricky and Hec gradually form a reluctant bond.\nAs in Waititi\'s earlier films, Hunt For The Wilderpeople is distinguished by a genuine affection for his eccentric characters. Sam Neill\'s initially unrecognisable as Uncle Hec - for a brief moment, your humble writer thought he was the erstwhile Independence Day star Randy Quaid - but a captivatingly human performance soon emerges from behind Neill\'s huge, wiry beard. There\'s a believable chemistry between Neill and Dennison, who\'s disarmingly unaffected as a wannabe gangster who really just wants a hot water bottle and a hug.\nThen again, Waititi is unfailingly adept at balancing his moments of off-kilter humour - such as his cameo as a callous priest, or Rhys Darby\'s brief role as a saucer-eyed survivalist - with gentle character beats and scenes of unexpected dramatic heft. The writer-director also stages a couple of stirring action sequences (variously involving vehicles and aggressive animals), which bode well considering Waititi\'s currently shooting Thor: Ragnarok for Marvel.\nIn visual terms, Hunt For The Wilderpeople is at its best in the first act, where Waititi and cinematographer Lachlan Milne create some beautifully lit interiors and night scenes of characters silhouetted against empty skies. The last two-thirds don\'t quite reach the same heights in terms of composition - perhaps because of the vigours of shooting outdoors on a budget - but there are still occasional flourishes here and there, such as a time-lapse shot where events seem to overlap one another.\nWhat remain consistently charming are the characters.

They also looked at broiler performance.\n\""These data support observations that E. maxima is an important cause of mortality, probably due to it predisposing chicks to necrotic enteritis,\"" Jenkins said.\nAlthough E. maxima-oocyst levels correlated with mortality, they did not correlate with broiler performance as measured by average daily weight gain and feed conversion ratio at 7 to 8 weeks, a finding Jenkins said was \""of interest.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNG99haALzmRUwwnIhIIsNFPVulZkw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=dp_pWYjZGYbwzAaB6ou4BA&url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/39341/e-maxima-linked-to-mortality-in-broilers-vaccinated-for-coccidiosis,EN,,20/10/2017 07:02,2017-10-19 06:49:27+00:00,ece86a9f0a,ThePoultrySite.com,,,,,1508402967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(AP) - All those yellow flags had Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre seeing a little red.\n                  Understandable.\n                  Isaiah Oliver returned a punt 68 yards for a score with 5:27 remaining and No. 21 Colorado overcame eight personal-foul penalties to beat UCLA 20-10 on Thursday night.\n                  \""You\'re going to have a game like that every once in a while,\"" MacIntyre said. \""But not with the selfish penalties we had. We\'ll fix that.\""\n                  \r\n                Oliver caught the punt on the right side of the field, cut back to the left and went untouched for the decisive score. It was the first punt return for a TD in 11 years for Colorado (7-2, 5-1 Pac-12, No. 15 CFP) and came on a night when the Buffaloes struggled to get much going.\n                  The game featured a combined 25 penalties for 224 yards, two blocked kicks and five turnovers - four by Colorado. UCLA (3-6, 1-5) has dropped four straight.\n                  \""Couldn\'t get anything going on offense and had some trouble on special teams. That\'s a good team and when that happens it\'s tough to win,\"" UCLA coach Jim Mora said.\n                  The Buffaloes struggled to control their temper and were called for taunting, roughing the passer, unsportsmanlike conduct and a targeting call that led to the ejection of outside linebacker Jimmie Gilbert early in the first quarter.\n                  MacIntyre vowed to make his team run laps for all those personal fouls.\n                  Really, though, the team gets the message.\n                  \""If you want to be Pac-12 championship team you can\'t be doing that stuff,\"" senior QB Sefo Liufau said. \""As a group, as a team, we can\'t let other people get under our skin. Ultimately, we\'ll end up hurting ourselves and hurting our chances.\""\n                  UCLA quarterback Mike Fafaul stepped in with Josh Rosen sidelined by a shoulder injury. He finished 15 of 29 for 185 yards and one TD. He also threw an interception.\n                  \""Colorado has a great defense,\"" Fafaul said.\n                  Liufau went a school-record 152 attempts without throwing an interception before tossing two in a span of six passes. Later, the senior fumbled on a big hit by Takkarist McKinley and was helped off the field. Freshman Steven Montez briefly took over.\n                  Colorado finished with 304 yards of offense but struggled to put points on the board for a second straight game.\n                  \""We\'ve got to go back and correct stuff,\"" tailback Phillip Lindsay said.\n                  THE TAKEAWAY\n                  UCLA: The Bruins were held to 25 yards rushing, well below their season average (85.5).

Two of their final three games are at home.\n                  POLL IMPLICATIONS\n                  It\'s hard to see Colorado moving up very much given the way the team played. Better to win ugly than not at all.\n                  RISING UP\n                  There was a section of the stands lined with flip cards that spelled out \""The Rise .\"" That\'s the Buffaloes\' mantra this season as they try to transform a once downtrodden program.\n                  \""They are a very exciting story not just in our conference but nationally, just to see the way the program has developed for them,\"" Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said.\n                  KICKING ISSUES\n                  Third-string Colorado kicker Chris Graham connected on a 37-yarder with 13:40 left to give the Buffaloes a 13-10 lead. He also hit a 21-yard field goal that was tipped at the line but still got through. He had another blocked.\n                  Colorado has kicker issues with Davis Price out because of mono and Diego Gonzalez done for the season after tearing his Achilles tendon.\n                  The Bruins fared no better on field goals, missing two kicks and having another blocked.\n                  This & That\n                  Among those attending the game included: Broncos boss John Elway and approximately 32 NFL scouts representing 21 teams. ... Lindsay had 11 catches for 76 yards, along with 73 yards rushing. He scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter. His 11 catches were a team record for a running back. ...It was Colorado\'s first win over UCLA since joining the Pac-12 in 2011. ... Fafaul said after the game that Rosen is bracing for surgery. \""It\'s tough for him,\"" Fafaul said.\n                  UP NEXT\n                  UCLA: Host Oregon State, a team the Bruins beat 41-0 last season.

811bd80345,Why Today Is an Important Anniversary in the Fight Against Police Brutality - Complex,"Today Is an Important Anniversary in the Fight Against Police Brutality\n\nIn the middle of the talk about jaunts to Paris and other-other-Benzes on Watch the Throne, Jay Z dropped a line attempting to show connections between generations of black activism. \""I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died,\"" he rapped on \""Murder to Excellence.\"" \""Real niggas just multiply.\""And, per Hov\'s insistence on #SuperFacts[1], the math checks out. Jay\'s born day-December 4, 1969-was the day when Black Panther Party deputy chairman Fred Hampton, as well as fellow Panther Mark Clark, were murdered by a coalition of the FBI and Chicago police.The circumstances surrounding the murder are horrifying. A raid was being planned on Hampton\'s apartment, ostensibly to find weapons, but really to kill him. Hampton was drugged with secobarbitol by an FBI informant who was the Panthers chief of security (and who was paid $300 for his role in the murder). The BPP leader was shot while in bed with his fiancé Deborah Johnson, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant at the time. Here are Johnson\'s memories of the early-morning raid, via an interview with Democracy Now[2]:\r\nSomeone came into the room, started shaking the chairman, said, \""Chairman, Chairman, wake up. The pigs are vamping.\"" Still half asleep, I looked up, and I saw bullets coming from, it looked like, the front of the apartment, from the kitchen area. They were-pigs were just shooting.\r\n\r\nAnd about this time, I jumped on top of the chairman. He looked up. Looked like all the pigs had converged at the entranceway to the bedroom area, back bedroom area. The mattress was just going-you could feel bullets going into it. I just knew we\'d be dead, everybody in there. When he looked up, just looked up, he didn\'t say a word. He didn\'t move, except for moving his head up. He laid his head back down, to the side like that. He never said a word. He never got up off the bed.  \r\n\r\nThe person who was in the room, he kept hollering, \""Stop shooting! Stop shooting! We have a pregnant woman, a pregnant sister in here!\"" At the time I was eight-and-a-half, nine months pregnant. My baby was to be delivered in two weeks. Pigs kept on shooting. So I kept on hollering out. Finally, they stopped. \r\n\r\nThey pushed me and the other brother by the kitchen door and told us to face the wall. Heard a pig say, \""He\'s barely alive. He\'ll barely make it.\"" I assumed they were talking about Chairman Fred. Then they started shooting. The pigs, they started shooting again. I heard a sister scream. They stopped shooting. Pig said, \""He\'s good and dead now.\"" The pigs were running around laughing. They was really happy, you know, talking about Chairman Fred is dead. I never saw Chairman Fred again.\r\nA federal investigation[3] would later show that the cops fired around 90 shots, while the Panthers shot just once. Cook County State\'s Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan, involved in planning the raid-and who, not coincidentally, was a frequent target of Hampton\'s criticism-was indicted, as were 13 cops. All were acquitted, in a pattern that sadly continues today[4].The only reason an investigation happened at all, and that we know the real story of Hampton and Clark\'s murder, is because of ceaseless agitation in the days following the raid. The police claimed, of course, that there was a shootout, and they were justified in opening fire. But over the next eight years[5], activists fought to get the real story out. It took until April, 1979, but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that there was \""serious evidence\"" that the FBI and the Chicago PD were part of a \""conspiracy designed to subvert and eliminate the Black Panther Party and its members.\""Hampton was only 21 (Clark, shot as police entered the apartment, was just a year older), but had already established himself as a prominent voice in the movement for black liberation. One of his primary concerns was with establishing a multi-racial radical front to fight capitalism. He founded the original Rainbow Coalition, well before Jesse Jackson adopted the same name for his efforts. Hampton\'s Rainbow[6] was a unification of  the Chicago Black Panther Party, Puerto Rican Young Lords, and Poor White Young Patriots Organization. As Hampton phrased it, \""We\'re gonna fight racism not with racism, but we\'re gonna fight it with solidarity.\""POST CONTINUES BELOWThe vision of a multi-racial coalition uniting to fight their true oppressors may seem farther away than ever in a world of increasing white supremacy and fragility[7]. But if Hampton and the BPP could unite three disparate radical movements in the face of dogged state repression nearly half a century ago, there\'s hope that it could happen again. And the long fight for the truth about Hampton\'s murder to be made public is something to keep in mind as the number of officer-involved shootings, as they are euphemistically called, keeps growing[8].So as you\'re celebrating Jay Z today by blasting \""Empire State of Mind\"" extra-loud, take time to learn about Chairman Fred and his legacy, and remind yourself that victories in the fight for justice are hard-fought, but they do happen. And remember Hampton\'s admonition about whose purposes racism really serves. \""Racism is an excuse used for capitalism,\"" he said[9] in a lecture. \""We know that racism is a by-product of capitalism.\""References^ #SuperFacts (jay-z.fanfire.com)^ Democracy Now (www.democracynow.org)^ federal investigation (www.chicagotribune.com)^ sadly continues today (www.cnn.com)^ next eight years (www.truth-out.org)^ Rainbow (kairoscenter.org)^ fragility (www.theroot.com)^ keeps growing (www.washingtonpost.com)^ said (www.youtube.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNElo1omGLEEraq_cZnyBX5EKWrhnQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779704453457&ei=gFImWqDrOrXqzAa667bQDA&url=http://www.complex.com/life/2017/12/fred-hampton-mark-clark-assassination-anniversary,EN,,05/12/2017 08:01,2017-12-04 18:59:10+00:00,7b34ef8790,Complex,,,,,1512417550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8b639fd60d,Why you should never make a decision when you are hungry - Medical News Today,"Why you should never make a decision when you are hungry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, have pinned down a hormone that is produced when we are hungry that interferes with rationality and decision-making. Rats given the hormone ghrelin were more likely to act on impulse.A new study on the hormone ghrelin shows that hunger and decision-making do not mix.\n\n\r\nImpulsivity affects everyone to differing degrees, and each individual can be more or less impulsive depending on the situation.\r\n\n\r\nForgoing something pleasurable now, in favor of something better later on, shows control. This so-called delayed gratification is regarded as the opposite of impulsive behavior.\r\n\n\r\nImpulsivity can be broken down into two types: Impulsive action, in other words, the inability to stop one\'s self from making a physical action; and impulsive choice, an inability to delay gratification.\r\n\n\r\nAlthough most people can control their impulses sufficiently, impulsivity is a major factor in a number of conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD[1]), obsessive-compulsive disorder[2] (OCD), eating disorders, and substance abuse. \r\n\n\r\nThis connection to various psychiatric conditions makes impulsivity an important area of study.\r\n\n\r\nEarlier studies have uncovered a relationship between food reward behavior and impulsivity. However, a mechanism has not yet been proven. \r\n\n\r\nA new study, published recently in Neuropsychopharmacology, aimed to fill this gap. The researchers investigated impulsivity in rats, specifically in relation to the hormone ghrelin.\r\n\nWhat is ghrelin?\n\r\nGhrelin is a hormone, produced in the gastrointestinal tract, that acts on the central nervous system[3]. It is released when the stomach is empty. Once the stomach has become filled, production of ghrelin ceases. Ghrelin readies the body for food, and it also works on cells of the hypothalamus to induce the feeling of hunger.\r\n\n\r\nThe role of ghrelin is not limited to the hunger response alone. It has also been implicated in the reward behavior associated with drugs, alcohol, and food intake.\r\n\n\r\nResearchers at the Sahlgrenska Academy, led by Karolina Skibicka, set out to investigate ghrelin\'s potential role in impulsive behavior.\r\n\n\r\nThe team trained rats to perform a variety of tasks that allowed them to measure impulsive behavior. The first, referred to as the \""go/no-go\"" test, measured the rats ability to restrain a response. \r\n\n\r\nRats were trained to either press a lever to get a reward - referred to as a \""go\"" signal - or they were rewarded for not pressing a lever - a \""no-go\"" signal. The rats were taught to either \""go,\"" or \""no-go,\"" dependent on an auditory signal (a light or buzzer).\r\n\n\r\nA second trial, called the \""differential reinforcement of low rate,\"" provided rats with a food pellet reward only if they were able to withhold their response for a set period of time.\r\n\n\r\nThe third leg, called \""delay discount,\"" measured the rats\' ability to delay gratification. The rats were presented with two levers, one of which would dispense one food pellet as soon as it was pressed, while the other would dispense four food pellets, but only after a significant delay. \r\n\n\r\nIf the first lever was pressed, the second was blocked. In this way, the rats were taught to reject their initial impulse in order to receive the maximum reward later on.\r\n\nGhrelin and impulsivity\n\r\nDuring the experiment, ghrelin was injected directly into the rats\' brains, replicating how the hormone would normally behave when the animals were hungry. \r\n\n\r\nAs expected, the injection made the rats unable to resist[4] pressing the lever in all three trials. In other words, impulsivity had increased.\r\n\n\r\nIn fact, in the \""go/no-go\"" trial, the rats were almost three times more likely to press the lever during a \""no-go\"" period when their brains were infused with ghrelin.\r\n\n\r\nFurther to this, the researchers found that just a short period of fasting gave the same impulsive results in the rats. \r\n\n\r\nSkibicka and her team managed to pinpoint the area of the brain that appears to be involved in this impulsive behavior.\r\n\n\""Our results showed that restricting ghrelin effects to the ventral tegmental area, the part of the brain that is a crucial component of the reward system, was sufficient to make the rats more impulsive. Importantly, when we blocked ghrelin, the impulsive behavior was greatly reduced.\"" Karolina Skibicka, associate professor \n\r\nThese findings are the first to demonstrate that ghrelin increases impulsivity in rats. The researchers hope that the findings might assist in the development of new psychoactive drugs. \r\n\n\r\nGhrelin antagonists (drugs that block ghrelin) are already being studied for their potential use as anti-obesity medications, and to help manage drug intake[5] in addicts.\r\n\n\r\nAs researchers uncover more details about the actions of this fascinating hormone, other therapeutic avenues look sure to open up.

8b9e2f3ff0,"Panthers\' Greg Olsen wants to tear up his contract, but team might not be willing - Asheboro Courier Tribune","Panthers\' Greg Olsen wants to tear up his contract, but team might not be willing - Sports - The Courier-Tribune\n\n\n			\n			\r\n				Joseph Person / Charlotte Observer\r\n			\n			CHARLOTTE - In the spring of 2015 the Carolina Panthers moved to lock up tight end Greg Olsen, who was coming off the first 1,000-yard receiving season of his career.The Panthers signed Olsen to a three-year extension worth $22.5 million, with $12 million guaranteed.All Olsen has done since then is post two more 1,000-yard seasons, becoming the first tight end in NFL history to have three consecutive 1,000-yard years.Olsen\'s production and reliability - he has made 80 consecutive starts for the Panthers - make his last deal look like a bargain hunter\'s dream. Olsen\'s extension was similar to those received by offensive tackle Michael Oher (three years for $21.6 million, with $9.5 million guaranteed) in 2016 and situational edge-rusher Mario Addison (three years, $22.5 million, $9 million guaranteed) in March.By just about any measure, Olsen has out-performed the contract, which runs through the 2018 season.And now he wants another one.Olsen, who\'s made the Pro Bowl the past three seasons, is looking for a deal that is commensurate with the NFL\'s top tight ends, according to a pair of league sources.Olsen\'s $7.5 million per-year average makes him the league\'s seventh-highest paid tight end, behind Jimmy Graham ($10 million), Travis Kelce ($9.4 million), Jordan Reed ($9.35 million), Rob Gronkowski ($9 million), Zach Ertz ($8.5 million) and Charles Clay ($7.6 million).Olsen is 12th among tight ends in terms of guaranteed money.Olsen, who will make $6.5 million over the next two years, was asked Tuesday if he hoped the Panthers would re-work his deal.\""In the ideal world, that\'d be great,\"" Olsen said. \""I\'m very confident on where I stand in the league and where I belong. Both productivity and all things considered, there\'s nobody that\'s been more productive or more consistent than I have. And I\'ll stand on that until the cows come home.\""\""You can make of that what you may,\"" Olsen added. \""I feel comfortable with where I belong, and hopefully other people do, too.\""The Panthers\' coaching staff and front office value Olsen for his accomplishments both on and off the field.He was one of three finalists for the 2016 NFL Man of the Year Award. Through his foundation, Olsen has raised $1.7 million for pediatric cardiology patients at Levine Children\'s Hospital.During Tuesday\'s practice Olsen was shadowed by Foster Hale, a 17-year-old Piedmont High student with leukemia, through the Make-a-Wish program. Olsen worked on Hale\'s football stance and bragged later that Hale caught the only two passes thrown to him during the Panthers\' first minicamp session.\""I don\'t know if we\'re thrilled about only two targets. I wouldn\'t be thrilled in a game with only two targets,\"" Olsen said. \""But you can only catch what they throw, right?\""\""Right,\"" Hale said.A message in order?Olsen could exert some control on his contract situation if he felt so inclined. Skipping one of the next two minicamp practices would send a message to general manager Dave Gettleman.But Olsen is not the type to take that kind of public stance, although he\'ll let you know when he\'s not happy with something - even if he softens things with a little humor or sarcasm.Olsen came in at No. 67 in the NFL Network\'s rankings of the top 100 players, down from No. 38 following the Panthers\' Super Bowl season. Washington\'s Reed (No. 65), Kansas City\'s Kelce (26) and New England\'s Gronkowski (23) all ranked ahead of Olsen. (The league\'s top 20 players have not been unveiled, yet.)Olsen last month tweeted a drawing of a football player done by his son Tate, who accompanied his artwork by noting, \""My dad is the 67 best player.\""\""Thanks @nflnetwork,\"" Olsen tweeted. \""I used to be #1 in his (eyes) #toughcrowd.\""For his first few years in Carolina, Olsen was considered the third-best tight end in the NFC South behind Tony Gonzalez and Graham. But then Gonzalez retired and Graham was traded from New Orleans to Seattle.Meanwhile, Olsen has kept pulling down about 80 passes a year.\""It\'s kind of been the story of my career,\"" Olsen said of being overlooked. \""If anything it\'s what\'s allowed me to have the success that I\'ve had and allowed me to just trying to keep improving as I\'ve gotten older. I always feel like no matter what you do, you don\'t quite get some of the recognition or the praise. But that\'s never really been something that\'s motivated me. It\'s never been something that I strive for.\""Opinions that matterOlsen he\'s more concerned with what his teammates and coaches think about him.Panthers coach Ron Rivera said he\'d put Olsen \""right at the top\"" among the best tight ends in the game.\""He\'s done a great job since he\'s been here. Every year he\'s had a great year,\"" Rivera said. \""We just expect him to continue to be that guy for us.\""Want to know what Cam Newton thinks of Olsen? Go back and look at all third-down throws Newton sent in Olsen\'s direction over the past six seasons.After sharing the ball with Jeremy Shockey during Olsen\'s first season in Charlotte, no tight end has been more effective as a pass-catcher than Olsen since 2012.Olsen\'s 4,844 receiving yards rank first among tight ends over that span, and his 383 catches are second only to Jason Witten\'s 393.\""I\'m never gonna win the popularity contest. It\'s just not my style. I\'m not the guy that wants to go out there and make everything about me - on game day, off the field,\"" Olsen said. \""I\'m gonna play, I\'m gonna be productive and I\'m gonna stand on that.\""If you look back the last five years in this league nobody\'s been more productive than me. I take a lot of pride in that and I think people are surprised when they look that up.\""Olsen will be 33 at the end of his contract. But he takes good care of himself and always answers the bell: He hasn\'t missed a game since sitting out Weeks 1-2 as a rookie with Chicago in 2007.No GM or owner wants to set the precedent of tearing up contracts a couple years early, concerned a long line of like-minded players will form at their door. But Olsen\'s stats and his impact to the organization and community make a compelling argument.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHdvLbaxz0ghhonUCJDCNzsEAqnWg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779528650479&ei=8t9AWeCeFYjqWPa3hfgF&url=http://www.courier-tribune.com/sports/20170613/panthers-greg-olsen-wants-to-tear-up-his-contract-but-team-might-not-be-willing,EN,,14/06/2017 07:03,2017-06-14 00:13:49+00:00,51fe179e08,Asheboro Courier Tribune,,,,,1497406429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8bdb64c0b6,The bitter rift tearing the Fifth Beatle\'s family apart: George Martin\'s daughter reveals how her father\'s will has ... - Daily Mail,"The bitter rift tearing the Fifth Beatle\'s family apart: George Martin\'s daughter reveals how her father\'s will has reignited a simmering feud with his \'second\' family\n\n    \n\n        Record producer George Martin playing the pianoBack in 1962, George Martin, the debonair head of Parlophone records, made two decisions that would change his life for ever.The first became the stuff of music legend. At 9am on February 13, he had a first meeting with Brian Epstein, a sometime furniture dealer from Liverpool, who wanted him to sign a pop group he was managing.They were called The Beatles. All the other London labels had turned them down. Martin would not make the same mistake.The second decision is less well known: that year, Martin abandoned Sheena, his wife of 14 years, and their children Alexis and Greg, for a new life with his glamorous office secretary. Judy Lockhart-Smith would become his second wife and mother of two more children, Lucie and Giles.The break-up is recalled today by Martin\'s oldest child, Alexis Stratfold: \'I remember standing at the top of the stairs at our home in Hatfield and listening to my mother begging my dad in the hallway not to go. \'She was saying: \""You can\'t do this. Please, please, don\'t leave me!\""\'I was eight years old and did not understand what was happening. All I knew was that she was feeling so much grief.\'Alexis pauses to collect herself. In the sun-baked courtyard of her French home, she\'s describing what happened in wintry England more than 50 years ago.    \n\n        In 1962 George Martin made the first decision that changed his life for ever by being the only record label to agree to sign The BeatlesEver since, the consequences have continued to resonate, but in recent months they have done so with renewed pain. I can reveal that, since Martin\'s death in March aged 90, long-standing tensions between the two sides of the so-called Fifth Beatle\'s family have deepened. There is now a bitter and apparently irreconcilable rift which could lead to legal action.At its heart are the terms of Martin\'s as yet unpublished will, a copy of which I have seen - and which reveals one of his children has been cut out entirely, while another has received \'a pittance\'.On one side of the settlement there is his first family, who one old friend described as Martin\'s \'Cinderella\' offspring. On the other, his second - Lady Martin and her children, who have been reaping the rewards of Martin\'s success for yearsThis is the story of the unknown Sir George Martin.    \n\n        The second biggest move of Sir Martin\'s life was leaving his wife Sheena of 14 years and their two children Alexis (pictured) and Greg for a new life with his glamorous secretaryHe was the greatest producer in the history of popular music who shaped the sound of The Beatles and gave it a depth and sophistication which would revolutionise pop.Their collaborations have now sold more than one billion records worldwide.In Las Vegas, the long-running, Beatles-based show LOVE grosses $60 million (or £45 million) a year. Martin was a music director and younger son Giles still is.Yet platinum discs and Beatles spin-offs alone would not have made Martin a \'national treasure.\' While other music moguls earned reputations for ruthlessness, egotism and wild living, Martin was a classically trained musician, an ex-naval officer and English gentleman; understated, humorous, polite and charitable.How, then, to explain the \'shocking\' terms of his financial legacy?He has left an amount small enough to avoid UK inheritance tax to be shared between daughter Alexis, his former chauffeur, his secretary, three grandchildren and a niece. His wayward older son Greg, with whom he had a troubled relationship, has not been left a penny.Martin stated in his will: \'I give free of tax to my trustees such sum as at my death equals the maximum amount which could be given by this will without inheritance tax becoming payable in respect of my estate.\' That \'maximum amount\', according to tax law, is £325,000.    \n\n        Sir Martin(right) married Judy Lockhart-Smith (left)  and had two more children, Lucie (pictured) and GilesAlexis is left 21 per cent of the sum, so she can expect £68,250. His grandson Connor Martin, son of Greg, gets the same.Alexis\'s son Saul, Martin\'s oldest grandchild, is left 16 per cent, or £52,000, as is Saul\'s sister Natasha. Sandra Parrott, Martin\'s niece, will receive £45,500, while the producer\'s former secretary and his driver, Shirley Burns and John Grover, share equally the remaining money, at most £39,000.The rest of his estate - an as yet unquantified amount, but one which Alexis believes to be a small fortune, given Martin\'s prodigious earnings over the years - goes to his 87-year old widow Judy. And if she had died before Martin, her bequest would have gone to their children Lucie and Giles \'in equal shares absolutely\'.A probate expert who has examined the will says: \'For someone whom we presume to be very wealthy, it is extremely simple.\'The members of Martin\'s first family also see it in simple terms.\'Passive and loyal\' for so long, but now angry and heartbroken, Alexis says the size of the settlement and the fact she has been \'categorised\' in the will alongside her father\'s employees is \'the final act of our marginalisation by dad\'.Her son Saul, 30, a media executive in Hollywood, goes further.He says: \'I loved my grandpa dearly, but it is so difficult to believe that he did this. It is a betrayal of his own family, and such a sad and unnecessary stain on his extraordinary legacy.\'On the day of Martin\'s death in March, Sir Paul McCartney wrote on his website: \'My family and I, to whom he was a dear friend, will miss him greatly and send our love to his wife Judy and their kids Giles and Lucie.\'The other \'kids\' - Alexis and Greg, children of Sheena who died in 2014 - were not mentioned, even though they were the only offspring who had been alive throughout Beatlemania.That hurt. But then, they had long been kept at arm\'s length and only afforded glimpses of Martin\'s showbiz world. \'Sometimes it felt as if we did not exist,\' says Alexis.Now 63, Alexis has lived in France for the past seven years with her second husband Rod, who was an art director for David Bowie and film maker Stanley Kubrick. They lead a comfortable but hardly lavish existence. Alexis works part-time as an estate agent.Her father died not long after she had returned to France having spent a week at his hospital bedside. The funeral was held in a church in the Wiltshire village where the Martins had lived since 1977. Just 25 close family and friends attended.Alexis\'s son Saul and her black-sheep brother Greg, 58, flew from the U.S. to attend.There was a reception on the lawns of the family home and, after Greg left, Judy and George Martin\'s three other children and their spouses discussed together their memories of their father.Inevitably, there were tensions, but these were as nothing compared with the storm that was brewing. The first rumbles came during the preparation for Martin\'s memorial service at St Martin-in-the-Fields in May.    \n\n        Alexis Stratford, age 6, kissing her  father, George Martin\'I had always thought we would plan it together as a family,\' says Alexis, but added that Martin\'s second family took over the whole thing. \'Giles organised the music and Lucie did the rest,\' she adds. \'Judy told me the event was more about Dad\'s public life than his private life.\'Martin\'s first child was clearly not considered sufficiently part of that public life to have been consulted.Then a friend phoned Alexis to ask if she\'d seen the invitation. She had not. It read: \'Lady Judy (sic), Lucie, Giles and the Martin family invite you to join them in a celebration of George\'s life and work.\'Alexis and Greg had again been written out of their father\'s history. Furious, Alexis phoned half-sister Lucie, who blamed the \'mistake\' on the PR firm who assisted her.The memorial was a starry affair. Guests included Sir Paul McCartney, who delivered a moving eulogy, and Elton John.Greg Martin did not attend. He had long ago fallen out with Martin and his second family. He burned with fury over the way Lucie and Giles enjoyed the trappings of fame and wealth, and went spectacularly off the rails.Aged 21, he told his stepmother she was an \'evil b***h\' and became persona non grata at his father\'s home.Trained as an actor at RADA, he moved to the U.S. and had a son with a socialite wife, but his philandering wrecked his marriage and he returned to London broke. Greg told his father he needed money - and Martin gave him £100,000, says Alexis, warning him that \'what you get now, you don\'t get later\'. The money soon disappeared and by 2001, Greg went bankrupt.Alexis did go to the memorial service. And even though she stood beside Judy and her half-siblings to greet mourners, she felt like a gate-crasher.This must have shown. For, the next day, Giles sent her a rare message on the social media service Whatsapp.It read: \'I hope you are okay. I realise there was some screw up on the invitations that I can assure you had nothing to do with Lucie or I.    \n\n        Second son Greg Martin with father Sir George Martin who died in March this year\'I could tell that you weren\'t just upset but angry yesterday. I hope you realise that I love you - you are my sister. I have never done anything to show you otherwise. I just hope you are ok. Much love to you in this difficult time for all of us.\'Alexis could hold back no longer. She replied: \'Hi Giles. I\'ve felt hurt that I was not included in anything at all to do with the memorial service. The cock-up on the printed invitations, no matter who was responsible for it, would not have happened if I had been included.\'Imagine how you would have felt in my shoes . . . Sadly this has highlighted our extraordinary family history . . . I\'ve always loved you and Lucie without reservation and appreciate your words, but actions really do speak louder.\'Sure you can understand my feelings of being marginalised over the years generally and much though . . . I hate bad feeling, this has needed to be said. We\'re all Dad\'s children.\'Giles didn\'t reply and Alexis has not heard from him since. And in the meantime came the blow from beyond the grave. Six days after the memorial service, Alexis received her father\'s will. She had asked Lucie for a copy on several occasions to no avail.Alexis says: \'I wonder now whether if I had been shown the will prior to the memorial service I would have attended.\'She asked Lucie for a meeting, which took place at a coffee shop in Holland Park, west London.\'I don\'t think that she reckoned on me being quite so upset,\' Alexis says, adding that Lucie insisted that everything their father possessed was in the will. \'She told me: \'Dad was no businessman. What he made, he spent.\'\'She denied that there were any hidden trusts. But at that time I did not know, as I do now, that she, Giles and Judy were longstanding directors of Dad\'s companies. I suggested that the settlement could be put right at a later date. She took this to mean after her mother died and got very offended. We parted on bad terms.\'Later Alexis sent Lucie a long, emotional email. Part of it read: \'There were so many examples I could cite over the years both big and small, of how we were . . . treated as second class compared to you two and your kids.\n\n    \n\n    Cilla Black teasing Beatles manager and British Record Producer Sir Martin in the early days of her career\'I know it is an uncomfortable thought for you to address but let us not beat about the bush here: the inequality is stark.\'The amount of £68,000 is . . . a pittance compared with what Dad owned. Do you and Giles honestly expect to receive the same amount from Dad\'s estate? I urge you to think about this fairly.\'Lucie replied that there was a gulf between Alexis\'s perception of her father\'s wealth and the reality. And that has been the sisters\' last contact.Alexis is awaiting the granting of probate which should allow her to see the extent of her father\'s assets in the UK. She has also instructed a solicitor to investigate the existence of offshore investments.She could make a claim against the estate. But if such a claim failed, she would be liable for all legal costs.So what was Sir George Martin worth? He quit the Parlaphone label in 1965 at the height of Beatlemania because he felt he was being underpaid. The parent company EMI had refused to pay him any royalties on the Beatles\' record sales, which brought them £2 million profit the previous year (the equivalent to almost £36 million today). Martin was on a mere £3,000 salary.    \n\n        Sir Martin with his second wife JudyAlong with Judy and three other young producers he set up Air Independent Recording (AIR).Scared to lose his magic touch with The Beatles, EMI caved in. In his 1979 autobiography, Martin wrote: \'After months of negotiations I finally settled on a series of producer\'s royalties on Beatles\' records. One for England, one for America, one for the rest of the world.\'In England, the royalty was approximately half of 1 per cent of the retail price. He would have got more for the Yellow Submarine film soundtrack album; Martin wrote the music for the whole of the second side.He did not retain these royalties for ever. In 1974, Chrysalis bought a stake in AIR and eventually a controlling share. This would seem to have included Martin\'s Beatles\' production royalties.However, it\'s not known what Martin got for the sale of his golden asset.He said back in 2007: \'My only regret with The Beatles is that I was wrongly advised, and signed away my royalties to their records - about half a penny per title but, with them, that would have been an enormous amount.\'His highest-earning years would appear to have been in the Seventies and Eighties when he had two brief spells of tax exile in California and the Channel Islands. (He later gave the property on Alderney, one of several the family owned, to Alexis).\'If an album in the States goes gold, it will earn a producer a small fortune,\' he wrote in his book. With his royalties from the folk-pop group America alone Martin says AIR was making $500,000 a year.Over his career, he produced 30 UK No 1 singles and 23 in the U.S., and almost as many chart-topping albums. He wrote film scores and established his own AIR recording studios in London and Monserrat, in which some of the most successful pop albums of the post-Beatles era were made.Recently there were fresh, presumably highly lucrative, Beatles projects. Martin re-mastered original Fab Four tracks for the multi-platinum selling Anthology albums, and the process is still going on: and this week a \'restored\' recording including unused tapes of the Beatles Live at the Hollywood Bowl in 1965 and remixed by Giles Martin was released to some acclaim.Martin\'s cut of the Las Vegas LOVE show is unknown but son Giles reworked it for its tenth anniversary this summer.\n\n    Martin and Cilla Black: Since his death the tensions between his two families has deepenedThis \'embedding\' of the children of his second family into \'George Martin Inc\' is another aspect that has long distinguished them from the offspring of his first marriage and further complicates the calculation of his wealth distribution.Public records show that Lucie and Giles have both been directors of Airborn Productions Ltd, along with their parents, for more than 20 years.Giles has also been a director of George Martin Music Ltd since his birth in 1969, while Lucie joined the board in 1995. A third, more recent company called Gilgo Ltd, has Martin\'s widow Judy, and Lucie and Giles as directors along with manager and executor Adam Sharp.What have these directorships been worth? Again it is impossible to say.\'People think I\'m a multi-millionaire,\' George Martin once said, \'and I\'m not.\'That assertion is now a matter of considerable scrutiny and no little heartache. Alexis Stratfold has received no fee but has asked for a donation to be made to the Brit School. ",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEX2L8mRvorCOW0WiGE83ecNHWmYA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=86rTV-C-NMSVWcDCjdgB&url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3782517/The-bitter-rift-tearing-Fifth-Beatle-s-family-apart-George-Martin-s-daughter-reveals-father-s-reignited-simmering-feud-second-family.html,EN,,10/09/2016 07:03,2016-09-09 20:58:00+00:00,5b41d61294,Daily Mail,,,,,1473461880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8c5ece08e6,Smiths Drummer Mike Joyce Called Out A British Grocery Chain Over \'Percy Pig\' Candies - Yahoo News,"Smiths Drummer Mike Joyce Tells Percy Pig Candymakers That Gelatin Is Murder\n\nFacebookSmiths[1] drummer Mike Joyce has a bone (and gristle and eyes and lips) to pick with high-end British grocery chain Marks & Spencer. On a recent shopping trip, Joyce realized that the M&S\' pig-shaped sweets marketed under the name of Percy Pig were made with pork-derived gelatin. Joyce sees this as a chicken-omelet level of warped and he let his feelings be known in a Facebook post[2].\""I know that a lot of sweet products and deserts contain some form of animal derivative but how many children know, or are made aware of the fact, that the Percy Pig sweet they are eating does in fact contain bits of Percy\'s skin, bone, ligaments etc.?\"" he asked the grocery store.Joyce took offense at the idea of \""dead pig\"" being served in cute pig chewies. Here\'s hoping he\'s taking offense at the \""pig\"" part and not the \""dead\"" part, otherwise British childhood is way more horrific than we\'ve been led to believe.The store does make a vegetable-based gelatin version of the candy, but that only led Joyce to more questions. Namely, why doesn\'t the store make all of their Percy Pig candies with a vegetable-based gelatin?\""Why not make them all veggie?

Tearing up the 23-year-old deal between the neighboring countries could put Trump at odds with his rural base, with farmers and ranchers dependent on trade for their livelihood. Companies including Cargill, which has facilities in Cedar Rapids, and Tyson Foods - the largest U.S. meat company has operations in Stockton and Waterloo - have called on the administration to protect agriculture during the negotiations.\""I talked to him this morning, actually,\"" Perdue said of his conversations with Trump. \""He\'s concerned about American agriculture,\"" but he\'s also concerned about trade deficits in other parts of the economy, particularly in automobiles and manufacturing, he said.Perdue said he hopes the administration can find a solution that \""reconciles\"" and \""resolves those issues.\""Since its adoption, the North American Free Trade Agreement has knit the three agricultural economies more tightly, with effects ranging from cattle being raised and processed across borders to U.S. dependence on Mexican avocados for guacamole at Super Bowl parties. A second round of negotiations on the accord is scheduled to begin today in Mexico City.Perdue said Wednesday the primary concerns he\'s been hearing from farmers on the NAFTA talks are issues regarding labor, regulations and trade.

920d0ce729,JULIE COUCH: The Senate proposes a hodgepodge of studies - Stillwater News Press,"JULIE COUCH: The Senate proposes a hodgepodge of studies | Opinion\n\nSince Oklahoma\'s legislative session ended in May, you thought they\'d com- pleted their work until 2017. You\'re incorrect. They\'ve requested a wide variety of study topics ranging from useful for the legislative process to a waste of time for staff research.Based upon astatementheadingthe SenateInterimStudiesRequests,all requestswere accept-ed and assigned to a committee. \""Itis at the discretion of each respective chair whether to hold a study.\"" A sen- ator could tell constituents about the study requests knowing those requests would probably go nowhere.The most publicized is a needed study on civil asset forfeiture request- ed by orthopedic appliance business owner Sen. Kyle Loveless, (R-OKC). This current process is often in the news because it allows law enforce- ment officers to seize assets of a sus- pect, even without a conviction, if the assets are suspected of having been used in a crime. An Aug. 5 story in the Wagoner Tribune details the tes- timony of a suspect\'s girlfriend who said their $10,000 seized by the sher- iff from their car was for Christmas and car shopping. The former sheriff is now awaiting trial on taking the money as a bribe for releasing the sus- pect and his girlfriend.Attorney John Sparks (D-Norman) filed a timely request to review long- term strategy for replacing revenue currently provided by oil and gas ex- traction.The humor award winner goes to Sen. Kay Floyd (D-Oklahoma City),an administrative law judge, who has filed the same study request for sever- al years. She requests a study exam- ining the monetary and non-monetary ramifications of filing unconstitutional legislation in Oklahoma. Her comment on the Oklahoma Policy Institute website explains, \""I think when law- makers are perceived as not knowing how to make law, that that hurts the perception people have of how our gov- ernment is supposed to work.\"" Actual- ly, some of those filing these unconsti- tutional bills probably do know how to make law.Sen. Frank Simpson (R-Springer),a part-time Methodist minister, filed four requests, the highest number filed. Simpson appears to have a wide range of interests. His topics include Oklahoma drones, the Heartland Flyer, feral swine eradication, and mining pit water disposal and aquifer recharge.Sen. Kevin Matthews (D-Tulsa),a retired Tulsa firefighter, filed the strange combination of examining the feasibility of decreasing student loan debt and increasing pay for teachers.Matthews also had an unusual and perhaps useful request to study teach- ing urban youth to grow and sell pro- duce in food deserts.Osage County rancher Sen. Eddie Fields (R-Wynona) wants to examine how Oklahoma can positively attract and encourage growth, diversification and recruitment of new business. Per- haps the top recommendation could be improving the legislature.Of course, someone had to include abortion. Sen. Joseph Silk (R- Broken Bow), a vacation property manager, filed what sounds like a philosophical study - examine the definitions of \""protecting the life of the mother ex- ceptions\"" and the \""definitions of life.\""Next week - the House adds 71 more requests.Julie Couch is a longtime Stillwater resident. ",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHu9t4B-yNpSPH5w3sI5Qw9z2gr0w&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=LnKtV9ipLoaWzAaOq6CwCg&url=http://www.stwnewspress.com/opinion/julie-couch-the-senate-proposes-a-hodgepodge-of-studies/article_7cbb8828-6033-11e6-904e-a76a33209bba.html,EN,,12/08/2016 07:10,2016-08-12 00:31:37+00:00,ad75cdc9e1,Stillwater News Press,,,,,1470969097,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

978a32b1dc,NSW drought: Local Land Services\' lambing strategies - Lithgow Mercury,"Lambing strategies to help drought-affected sheep survive\n\nDROUGHT affected sheep producers can expect extra problems for spring lambing this year, but there are a number of strategies that can be adopted to improve lamb survival rates, Local Land Services regional veterinarian Bruce Watt says.Research into reducing lamb mortality has found that the early bond between ewe and lamb is crucial for lamb survival and the risk of mis-mothering of lambs increases significantly when sheep are being hand fed.\""Ideally a ewe will spend over four hours with the lamb at the birth site, grooming the lamb immediately after delivery, helping the lamb to nurse, and cementing the maternal bond,\"" Dr Watt said.Ideally a ewe will spend over four hours with the lamb at the birth site, grooming the lamb immediately after delivery, helping the lamb to nurse, and cementing the maternal bond.However if the bonding process is disrupted, such as when the ewe bolts to the feed trail or heads for the self-feeder, mis-mothering can occur leaving the lamb vulnerable to starvation, exposure and predation.Dr Watt said there were a number of strategies that would reduce the possibility of mis-mothering based on previous research including work undertaken at the Cowra Research Station.  He said feeding ewes in the early afternoon allow the most time for mothering up before nightfall, while mob size and stocking rates also have an impact on lamb mortality.\""Managing twin bearing ewes in smaller mobs, separately from single bearing ewes, can significantly improve lambing success. It might also be possible to drift ewes that are yet to lamb, away from recently lambed ewes,\"" Dr Watt said.Researchers have found that ewes lambing in paddocks with short green feed do equally well when fed a grain/lupin mix from a self-feeder, or fed every second day from troughs.Read moreDr Watt said self-feeders should be at least 50 metres from water and shelter.Ideally each self-feeder should supply no more than 220 single ewes or 100 twin bearing ewes.Trail feeding can give better control of the amount being fed.Managing twin bearing ewes in smaller mobs, separately from single bearing ewes, can significantly improve lambing success. It might also be possible to drift ewes that are yet to lamb, away from recently lambed ewes.Dr Watt said disturbance to lambing ewes could be further reduced by feeding 2-3 times a week rather than daily.\""Some sheep producers might choose to broadcast out albus lupins or faba beans onto paddocks to supply sufficient feed for several weeks, avoiding the need to trail feed,\"" he said.\""We\'re also aware of producers who plan on using whole cotton seed dumped into the paddock, which ewes are inclined to eat slowly, rather than gorge in a single rushed feed.\""For further advice on lambing in dry conditions and supplementary feeding, contact your Central Tablelands Local Land Services vet or livestock officer. ",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNE6ZEvPIDfxWdHiGctDq5OdsoCRPQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=4q5_W6D6NdHtzAaaubSIBw&url=http://www.lithgowmercury.com.au/story/5604803/lambing-strategies-to-help-drought-affected-sheep-survive/,EN,,24/08/2018 07:05,2018-08-23 20:02:05+00:00,7903d30a98,Lithgow Mercury,,,,,1535061725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98bd50d020,/video/video.news.com.au/News/ - NEWS.com.au,"Sonny Bill Williams missed Sevens World Series in Las Vegas because he flew economy\n\nRugby Sevens: Australia ahve blown a huge half-time lead to lose 21-15 to Fiji in the final of the Las Vegas World Series.\nSBW was in plenty of pain.GEE, being an elite athlete is tough, isn\'t it?Sonny Bill Williams is used to living a life of luxury as rugby league and rugby union teams alike pay top dollar for his services, but recently he found out what it was to live like the everyday Joe - and it was a lifestyle that didn\'t agree with him.Williams was a conspicuous absence from the New Zealand team that competed in the World Rugby Sevens Series in Las Vegas during the past week due to a knee injury. Now it\'s been revealed the smaller budget of sevens teams compared to the money available in the 15-a-side game was partially responsible for his no-show on the field.The 30-year-old, along with the rest of his teammates, flew economy class from the Shaky Isles to America - not business class as he became accustomed to when playing for the Crusaders and the Chiefs in the Super Rugby competition.This meant he couldn\'t wear a compression brace on his troublesome knee - as he normally does on flights - and as a result, it swelled up and kept him out of the entire tournament.The news was revealed by TVNZ reporter Jack Tame on Radio Sport.\""Because Sonny was in economy class he couldn\'t wear a compression brace on his knee that would usually make it a whole lot tighter,\"" Tame said.\""I think the team management were pretty frustrated about that, that he couldn\'t have that brace on. He got to Vegas and was training okay but then his knee started swelling up again, the liquid came back.We didn\'t see any of this in Las Vegas.Source:News Corp Australia\""My understanding is that they were expecting Sonny to be able to fly business class. The team management had talked to Air New Zealand and arranged something ... but then they weren\'t able to.\""They turned up at the airport and he was told, \'Sorry buddy, you\'re down in 56J or whatever, down in between the bogs and the babies.\'\""The lack of leg room during the 12-hour flight from Auckland to San Francisco, en route to Las Vegas, meant Williams couldn\'t straighten his leg with the brace on. So, he had to go without in cattle class - a means of travel plenty of people are all too familiar with.New Zealand Rugby general manager Neil Sorensen was quoted in stuff.co.nz[1] as saying the organisation tries to organise upgrades if needed, but the airline the team travelled with wasn\'t able to meet their requests this time.\""The sevens tournament organisers pay for economy class air travel for all players,\"" Sorensen said.\""Where possible New Zealand Rugby requests upgrades to premium or business class. Air New Zealand was not able to meet some requests for the USA trip due to availability.\""Sorensen confirmed to stuff.co.nz that Williams flew home in business class.After winning last year\'s rugby World Cup with the All Blacks, Williams made the switch to the sevens format in the hope of winning a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.The Kiwis were knocked out of the Las Vegas Cup by South Africa 14-7 in the quarter-finals. Their next tournament is in Hong Kong starting April 8.References^ stuff.co.nz (www.stuff.co.nz)\n#datearemp\n#coordtemp",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFbMWVdSXiNokFT-vezx9coPVYl1Q&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779059353499&ei=94jeVvi_McGdauLtnMAC&url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/rugby/sonny-bill-williams-aeroplane-seat-cost-him-dearly/news-story/4b17487d565f99dfd4c540db2a07fd54,EN,,08/03/2016 08:11,2016-03-07 09:35:53+00:00,d4f07714c5,NEWS.com.au,,,,,1457346953,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9cc6f1e50a,Mike Royko exposes huge pro-choice lie | The Barbershop: Dennis ... - ChicagoNow (blog),"Mike Royko exposes huge pro-choice lie\n\n\nLeading abortion advocates are circling their wagons, and poor Ron Fitzsimmons, once one of them, seems to have been shoved outside the tight circle.\nFitzsimmons is the conscience-stricken head of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers who now admits that he took part in telling Americans the big lie about so-called partial-birth abortions.\nDuring the national debate on the late-term brain-sucking procedure, Fitzsimmons was one of many pro-abortion spokespersons and media dupes who assured the nation that almost all late-term abortions were done to preserve the health of the mother or because the fetus had serious abnormalities.\nNow, Fitzsimmons said, \""I lied through my teeth.\"" And that most late-term abortions were done for the same reason as early abortions--because women wanted to end pregnancies.\nFitzsimmons\' confession was barely out of his mouth when he was whopped by fellow abortion advocates, who held a news conference to say, in effect, that he was being truthful when, he now says, he was lying. But now he is lying when he says he is finally being truthful.\nTypical was Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. She said: \""If he thinks he lied, that\'s his problem to deal with. We have not lied.\""\nGloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said Fitzsimmons had been \""mixing up gestation with procedure.\""\nWhatever the heck that means.\nWhile they squabble about who did or didn\'t lie, let\'s listen to someone else for once--genuine physicians, rather than the pro-abortionlobbyists and other non-medical spin experts who seem to get all the invitations to yap on TV.\nOne is Dr. Pamela Smith, former director of medical education in obstetrics and gynecology at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She recently resigned that post to do anti-abortion public-health work in the community and practice medicine at the Lawndale Health Center.\nThe only thing that surprised her about Fitzsimmons\' confession was that he made it.\n\""Most of the time, there is nothing wrong with the baby or the mother (when late-term abortions are performed),\"" she said. \""People have known about this for a decade.\n\""There is a clinic in New Jersey that said of the 3,000 abortions it did last year, 1,500 were late-term.\n\""So we went from being told that only 200 a year were being done in the entire country to one clinic saying it does 1,500 a year. Obviously, the actual number (of late-term abortions) is in the thousands.\n\""The media believe what they want to believe. And because a lot of doctors who have testified in support of the partial-birth ban have been pro-life, the knee-jerk response is that it is a pro-life/pro-choice thing.\n\""There\'s been all this propaganda that it is done only because women need it. So people said: `If my wife needs to have this to save her life, she should have it.\' The problem is that it is not this procedure versus your wife\'s life. It\'s really infuriating to me to hear that women medically need this.\""\nOne of the arguments for the late-term procedure is that it helps a woman preserve her fertility. Smith describes that as \""fantasy.\""\nThe future-fertility risk was one of the excuses offered by President Clinton when he vetoed the bill that would have outlawed the procedure.\nClinton said: \""There are a few hundred women every year who have personally agonizing situations where their children are born or are about to be born with terrible deformities which will cause them to die either just before, during or just after childbirth.\n\""And these women, among other things, cannot preserve the ability to have further children unless the enormous size of the baby\'s head is reduced before being extracted from their bodies.\""\nWhich is bunk, according to Dr. Nancy Romer, chairman of obstetrics at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton and a clinical professor at Wright State University.\n\""I don\'t understand that argument about fertility at all,\"" she said. \""We have no idea what happens to women who have this procedure down the road. We don\'t have a clue. There is no scientific evidence that shows that procedure will preserve the fertility of women.\""\nDr. Curtis Cook, who specializes in maternal fetal medicine at Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich., said: \""I can\'t think of any situation where the procedure would be preferable over existing techniques. I question why it is not being taught or performed by the majority of people who specialize in these pregnancies.\""\nAs for the propaganda campaign that led Clinton to veto the bill outlawing the procedure, Romer believes she understands it:\n\""Those who opposed the legislation have a much broader agenda, and that is to have totally unrestricted access to abortion. They will defend abortion rights blindly, regardless of the facts of the matter. Any legislation, if it\'s anti-abortion, they are against it.\n\""They don\'t think, `Is this procedure appropriate, who is doing it and why are they doing it?\' They don\'t care about the details. They won\'t acknowledge the truth of what we are saying because it defeats their larger agenda.\""\nSo the whole battle is going to be fought in Congress one more time. And if a bill passes and gets to Clinton\'s desk, maybe he can ask the CIA or the FBI to find out who is telling the truth before he makes any more somber pronouncements.\nCopyright Chicago Tribune Co.

9e3ab3c934,An Unassuming Heroine Envies Her Harvard Classmates the Confidence of Their Convictions - New York Times,"An Unassuming Heroine Envies Her Harvard Classmates the Confidence of Their Convictions\n\n\n        Selin - the language-intoxicated, 6-foot-tall Russophile daughter of Turkish immigrants - arrives at Harvard in the mid-90s, almost appallingly innocent. In the year we spend with her, she flirts with one classmate, in her stilted fashion; smokes a few cigarettes; travels to Hungary to teach English; dances perplexedly at a club - \""It went on and on, the dancing. I kept wondering why we had to do it, and for how much longer.\"" Mainly, she reads - but how she reads. Batuman is wonderful on the joy of glutting oneself on books. In \""The Possessed\"" she describes devouring \""Anna Karenina\"" sprawled on her grandmother\'s \""super-bourgeois rose-colored velvet sofa, consuming massive quantities of grapes\"" and tearing through Babel while baking an ill-fated Black Forest cake; her memories of the Red Cavalry sequence forever mingled with \""the smell of rain and baking chocolate.\"" A dictionary is a fetish object in \""The Idiot,\"" and Batuman conveys Selin\'s all-night reading benders with druggy fervor. Her instincts are, in general, excellent - she is Selin, more or less - save the odd, unhappy decision to repurpose details, characters, conversations and even whole scenes from her previous book: judging a beauty contest of boys\' legs at a Hungarian summer camp, being given chase by a wild dog. Too often, the novel reads like a greatest-hits version of \""The Possessed.\""\n    \nContinue reading the main story[1]\n\nBut the real pleasures of Selin\'s company come from her differences from the author, not their commonalities. She\'s not the type to fire off manifestoes on the sterility of M.F.A. fiction (not yet, at least); she scarcely knows what to think and envies her classmates the quantity and confidence of their convictions. \""It was a mystery to me how Svetlana generated so many opinions,\"" she says of a friend. \""Any piece of information seemed to produce an opinion on contact. Meanwhile, I went from class to class, read hundreds, thousands of pages of the distilled ideas of the great thinkers of human history, and nothing happened.\"" Selin is amazingly passive and almost seems miscast in her own life as protagonist. She\'s a born Watson, a Boswell; her gift is not for the living, but the telling, for the shaping of a story. Inevitably, she gravitates to larger, louder personalities: worldly Svetlana and Ivan, a math scholar from Hungary - and the novel\'s reluctant leading man.Selin comes to believe she has two lives - one at school, the other in her cryptic email courtship of Ivan. The idea that our most important and exciting experiences occur in private, in secret, Batuman tells us, is from Chekhov, whose ghost presides benevolently over the book. Selin could be any number of his gentle, ineffectual intellectuals, whose very gentleness and ineffectuality make them so important, according to Nabokov. \""In an age of ruddy Goliaths it is very useful to read about delicate Davids,\"" he remarked in one of his lectures at Cornell. \""All this lovely weakness, all this Chekhovian dove-gray world is worth treasuring in the glare of those strong, self-sufficient worlds that are promised us by the worshipers of totalitarian states.\""But does Batuman judge Selin more harshly? The title, \""The Idiot\"" - as with \""The Possessed,\"" cribbed from Dostoyevsky - seems like an unfair indictment of gentle, hardworking Selin, but at its root, \""idiot\"" is a benign word, even a strangely sweet one. It originally described someone who doesn\'t serve in public life (from the Greek idios, pertaining to the self), someone who is a private individual, who belongs to herself. And so much of Selin\'s heartache hinges on her efforts to bridge distances between her private and public selves, between her and other people, using the same tools we all reach for: language, travel, jokes. Sex belongs on this list, too, but Selin - and \""The Idiot,\"" in fact - is curiously prim. I wondered about this; why this reticence about desire in a book about falling in love, and as a teenager at that? I wondered, too, why here, as in \""The Possessed,\"" so many of the book\'s more emotionally charged scenes happen offstage and are conveyed to us in summary, if at all. Batuman is an energetic and charming writer and, perhaps, there are wages to this kind of charm - namely in remembering to relinquish it when you need to, remembering to risk being messy, boring or obvious to get at those truths only fiction, she tells us, can access. But for all these moments of evasion, there is more oxygen, more life in this book, than in a shelf of its peers. And in the way of the best characters, Batuman\'s creations are not bound by the book that created them. They seem released into the world. Long after I finished \""The Idiot,\"" I looked at every lanky girl with her nose in a book on the subway and thought: Selin.Continue reading the main story[2]\n    References^ Continue reading the main story (news.google.com)^ Continue reading the main story (news.google.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNF5QJml7hKGElqPCdvFBoI-eeC26g&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=nFzbWJi2FdeHWdO-qOAE&url=http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/books/review/the-idiot-elif-batuman.html,EN,,29/03/2017 07:05,2017-03-27 07:00:34+00:00,5b41d61294,New York Times,,,,,1490605234,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mortality rate was 40, which is a percentage of 0.01 per cent.\nMinister standing firm\nMr Vowles\' comments have done nothing to shift Mr Littleproud from his stance.\nDavid Littleproud addresses the Rural Press Club of Qld lunch in Brisbane.

If it could harm ngamia                   (camels), goats\' cattle and other animals surely it would harm rhinos as well,\"" said Leakey.\nHe further blamed senior KWS officials who ignored the Board\'s directive and went ahead to set up the sanctuary and eventually trans-locating the rhinos.\n\""How senior most officers in absence of the board decided to move 11 rhinos into a sanctuary where previous board had said no still baffles me. It means he just woke up one day and said I will do it anyway or somebody picked up the phone and told him to do it,\"" he explained.\nLeakey refuted claims that he was interfering with the operations of KWS where he was accused of having insiders who report to him despite having left.\nOn 31 July this year, Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala who appeared before the committee alleged that Leakey was undermining his position by allegedly kicking out former Tourism PS Fatuma Hirsi during a board meeting notwithstanding his pleas.\n\""The PS faced many challenges during her time on the board, she was chased away by Dr. Leakey and she never sat on the board since then. Her deputy was the one sitting on the board on behalf of the ministry,\"" said Balala.\nLeaky however denied all the allegations adding that once he left the office, he excluded himself from all decision making.\nAfter his submissions, the committee promised to unearth all the underlying issues at the KWS and whoever slept on their job or misadvised the CS will be responsible saying the deaths of the rhinos were caused by utter negligence.\nFollowing the deaths of the rhinos, Tourism CS Najib Balala suspended six senior KWS staff pending disciplinary action.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNFBSfD5hvKOfXI_IzkVEiMTnCYZ3Q&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52780016697449&ei=4q5_W6D6NdHtzAaaubSIBw&url=https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2018/08/poisonous-water-caused-deaths-of-11-rhinos-at-tsavo-says-leakey/,EN,,24/08/2018 07:05,2018-08-23 11:24:30+00:00,7903d30a98,Capital FM Kenya,,,,,1535030670,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mangelsen/www.mangelsen.com\n                                    \n                                                              \n                                \n\n    \n                                \n                                \n                                \n\n								\n								The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the states of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming are aligned on the idea of removing federal Endangered Species Act protections for Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bears, and we could be looking at a federal delisting as early as this autumn. This, despite the fact that most of the American public polled wants these bears to remain protected, and fewer Americans still have any stomach for the thought of the states unleashing trophy hunters to kill these animals in the lower 48 states for the first time in decades[1].\nEven while federally protected, grizzly bears are fighting for their lives. According to data released by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team (IGBST), the bears\' 10-year mortality trend has increased at a rate that should prompt federal wildlife managers to redouble conservation efforts, not turn the management of bears over to states hell-bent on adding yet another form of human-caused mortality. A new IGBST document reveals a record number of Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) grizzly bear deaths in 2015. With the help of longtime grizzly bear advocate Louisa Willcox, we\'ve discovered that 85 GYE bears died last year, including Scarface, a 25-year-old iconic Yellowstone grizzly bear[2], who was shot and killed outside the park\'s boundary. This year, a record 35 bears have already been killed, and we haven\'t even made it to fall, when most bear deaths occur. There\'s no way this is acceptable or sustainable, and it makes it pretty darn clear that delisting is flat-out dangerous for the health of this population.\nThe removal of federal protections comes at the same time that grizzly bears\' historic major food sources - such as whitebark pine seeds and cutthroat trout - are in decline because of human causes, including climate change. As a result, grizzly bears must turn to foods either outside the safe boundaries of the Park, or rely on elk, deer, and other large animals inside the park - which often puts the bears, especially young cubs, at risk of predation from other native carnivores.\nTo get to the delisting finish line, Montana and Wyoming have fast-tracked their public processes, illegally tripping over public notice requirements, withholding key documents from public view, and otherwise failing to fully keep the public in the loop. To hold them accountable, The HSUS, along with the Center for Biological Diversity and a retired U.S. Geological Survey employee, filed a lawsuit[3] challenging the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission\'s illegal adoption of grizzly bear hunting regulations that open the door for trophy hunting once the bears are stripped of Endangered Species Act protections. The Commission voted to approve a regulation that was not even made available to the public. This follows on the heels of our ongoing litigation in Wyoming[4], where the commission adopted grizzly hunting regulations without giving the public sufficient time to comment on reams of public documents. It\'s become clear that the states - like FWS - are committed to delisting GYE bears as quickly as possible, even if that means running roughshod over public input, scientific dissent, and state law.\nThe USFWS plans to allow the public to comment on its delisting proposed rule, but not on the GYE grizzly bear Conservation Strategy Plan, which was substantially altered by a panel of biologists, none of whom were GYE grizzly bear experts (one, for example, was an expert on the black bears of Kentucky). The new Conservation Strategy Plan fails to provide for a sufficient no-hunting buffer around the Yellowstone National Park, a fact that caused Superintendent Dan Wenk to protest, to no avail, at a recent meeting.\nThere\'s just no compelling reason for the feds to put these bears at the mercy of the states. This is a small population of a few hundred bears that is geographically isolated, and at risk from a growing array of threats. The new mortality data alone should cause federal officials to slam on the brakes for its delisting effort. What\'s more, the bears are a primary lure for millions of people who come to Yellowstone. Yes, they love to see the waterfalls,hot springs, and other features of the landscape, but they are most interested in seeing the bears and the wolves. How\'s allowing hunters to kill them in the fall going to play with the public?\nThe states have dealt with a no-hunting standard for decades, and there\'s no reason to discard that sensible policy, especially as public attitudes have solidified around the position that killing these animals for their heads is unacceptable. When there are conflicts, there are a host of practical, non-lethal solutions[5], such as removing stillborn calves and lambs from the landscape, that can deter grizzly bear conflict by over 90 percent.\nThe HSUS remains strongly opposed to the proposed delisting. The best available science indicates that these animals require far more protections right now, not less. The public process involved has been deplorable and the agencies involved do not seem to be aware of either the science or what the majority of the public wants.\nProtect grizzly bears from trophy hunters »[6]\n\n								\n\n								                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                									\n                                        Categories                              \n                                        Public Policy (Legal/Legislative)[7], Wildlife/Marine Mammals[8]                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                                                        \n                                                                                                                \n                                							References^ for the first time in decades (www.humanesociety.org)^ Scarface, a 25-year-old iconic Yellowstone grizzly bear (www.dailymail.co.uk)^ http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2016/08/lawsuit-filed-challenging.html Ctrl+Click or tap to follow the link (www.humanesociety.org)^ ongoing litigation in Wyoming (www.humanesociety.org)^ practical, non-lethal solutions (www.blackfootchallenge.org)^ Protect grizzly bears from trophy hunters » (www.change.org)^ Public Policy (Legal/Legislative) (blog.humanesociety.org)^ Wildlife/Marine Mammals (blog.humanesociety.org)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEIbORFrhH4pQM2q3Sn7wpLCRtQmQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779188406156&ei=eue_V6CDM8TszAak3pGYBA&url=http://blog.humanesociety.org/wayne/2016/08/grizzly-bears-gun-yellowstone-region.html,EN,,26/08/2016 07:14,2016-08-24 22:12:41+00:00,cf49dae16b,HSUS News (blog),,,,,1472083961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saudi leaders have indicated that OPEC and other nations will continue curtailing petroleum production, which should keep a lid on global supplies and keep prices elevated.Meanwhile, rising American demand for gasoline and diesel fuel has cut into supplies which have been tightening for weeks.These factors pushed oil futures near $54 per barrel for the first time since March. As oil climbs, fuel prices are coming along for the ride, with gasoline prices jumping 20 cents over the last month.\n    Investors stampede into cattle marketInvestment funds have been piling into the cattle market, which is driving futures into new highs. This move comes despite recent news from the USDA that cattle herds are swelling, which could lead to a backlog of beef next year.For consumers, this action could lead to unwelcome high prices at the store, but investor demand is great news for cattle producers who are looking at fat profit margins at current levels. Higher cattle prices and cheap corn (a major input costs for beef producers) are a welcome relief after months of unprofitable prices.\n    To fully capture the current profitability, producers can pre-buy their corn needs and pre-sell the cattle they\'ll take to slaughter next year, locking in the current values through futures contracts, which stood at $3.48 per bushel and $1.20 per pound, respectively, on Friday.Auto industry charges palladium prices\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox\n                \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    Palladium prices topped $1000 an ounce for the first time in sixteen years as demand for the metal has been rising sharply.Over 75 percent of the demand for palladium comes from the autocatalyst industry, where the metal is used to clean up emissions from gasoline vehicles.

a6c5a2823f,"No bin police here: council chiefs rule out \""punitive\"" household recycling tactics - Worcester News","council chiefs rule out \""punitive\"" household recycling tactics (From Worcester News)\n\n\n  COUNCIL chiefs in Worcestershire insist they will not be punishing householders who fail to recycle enough or put the \""wrong items\"" into bins.\n\n\n  With recycling[1] rates stalling around the country more local authorities are turning to controversial so-called \'punitive measures\' to get a grip on it.\n\n\n  In Stoke-on-Trent more than £100,000 of taxpayers\' money has gone on a team of \'bin police\' to go around ticking householders off, while others like Flintshire in Wales are threatening £80 fines.\n\n\n  But the deputy leader of Worcestershire County Council[2] has emphatically ruled out any copycat tactics, saying the onus must be on persuasion instead.\n\n\n  It comes at a time when recycling rates in Worcestershire have reached a plateau, with national targets in danger of being missed.\n\n\n  Cllr Anthony Blagg, who is also cabinet member for the environment, said: \""I\'m still convinced there\'s quite a bit of increased capacity for increasing recycling.\n\n\n  \""I know there are areas where people put \'recyclates\' into their non-recycling bins, but we\'re not going to be doing punitive measures to householders, you\'ll be glad to hear, as you may have read in the Daily Mail from other councils.\""\n\n\n  While the district councils collect household bins, County Hall is responsible for disposing of it.\n\n\n  The county council\'s huge household recycling plant at Norton has recovered all sorts of dodgy items from recyclable waste in recent years including car batteries, paint, clothes and even a dead pig.\n\n\n  The overall rate of household recycling has shot up over the last decade but has settled down at around 43 per cent in the county, with some significant variations across Worcestershire\'s districts.\n\n\n  But the Government wants all areas to reach 50 per cent by 2020, something most parts of the UK will miss on current trends.\n\n\n  Meanwhile Cllr Jabba Riaz, the cabinet member responsible for bin collections at Worcester City[3] Council, also says he would not back a \""Big Brother approach\"".\n\n\n  \""It was just before my time but I remember when the current system (of alternative recycling and general rubbish collections) came in, there was talk of chips in the bins,\"" he said.\n\n\n  \""It was decided that going Big Brother was a step too far.\""\n\n\n  Last year the Government issued guidance stopping councils from issuing fines for minor incidents such as putting the rubbish out early or placing a yoghurt pot in the wrong bin.\n\n\n  But the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) does allow penalties for householders guilty of a \""public nuisance\"", such as allowing bags to pile up.\nReferences^ recycling (news.google.com)^

a8aec1d827,What a Lamb in a Sweater Can Teach Us About How We See Cats and Dogs - One Green Planet,"What a Lamb in a Sweater Can Teach Us About How We See Cats and Dogs\n\n\n				\n				When we think of pets[1], we think of our dogs and our cats. Some of us might even think of birds or rabbits. Regardless of what type of pet we\'re lucky to call ours, it\'s hard to picture our lives without them. Days wouldn\'t be the same without playtime and snuggles with these special members of our families. We bond with dogs and cats, and regard them as special, which they certainly are. But why is it that most of us think of only these few types of animals[2] when thinking of animals we love and protect? Why doesn\'t our love and compassion extend to all animals[3]?\nSeeing this loving photo of a rescued lamb and her caretaker, we can\'t help but to wonder if these animals are indeed different from our beloved pets.\n \nRosie[4] is an adorable rescued baby lamb[5] living at Edgar\'s Mission[6], a farm sanctuary in Victoria, Australia. She\'s cute as a button, and loves to snuggle up to you in her pink sweater, just like your own pup[7] at home! Looking into Rosie\'s eyes, it\'s easy to see the same sweetness and innocence we see in the eyes of our pets at home. Farm animals[8] are just as emotionally complex[9] and loving as any cat or dog. Don\'t they deserve to be seen and treated the same way?\nAnimals involved in factory face a life of suffering that we cannot even begin to imagine. Lambs like Rosie can live well into their teen years but are mercilessly slaughtered for meat at six to eight months old. If any are disabled, like many of Rosie\'s friends[10] at Edgar\'s Mission[11] are, they are killed immediately. We could not imagine treating our pets this way, yet we continue to consciously direct our attention away from the fact that we support industries that abuse other animals. It is only when the world begins to see that all animals are innocent, complex, and understanding creatures that deserve compassion that the fate of little ones like Rosie will drastically change. Until then, you can make a difference by\nIt is only when the world begins to see that all animals are innocent, complex, and understanding creatures that deserve compassion that the fate of little ones like Rosie will drastically change. Until then, you can make a difference by supporting farm sanctuaries[12] like this one and using your voice to educate others.\nLead Image Source: Edgar\'s Mission[13]\n\n				\n					\n\n				\n\n\n				\n				\n				\n			    \n			    \n			References^ pets (www.onegreenplanet.org)^ few types of animals (www.onegreenplanet.org)^ extend to all animals (www.onegreenplanet.org)^ Rosie (www.facebook.com)^ rescued baby lamb (www.edgarsmission.org.au)^ Edgar\'s Mission (www.edgarsmission.org.au)^ own pup (www.onegreenplanet.org)^ Farm animals (www.onegreenplanet.org)^ just as emotionally complex (www.onegreenplanet.org)^ Rosie\'s friends (www.edgarsmission.org.au)^ Edgar\'s Mission (www.edgarsmission.org.au)^ supporting farm sanctuaries (www.onegreenplanet.org)^ Edgar\'s Mission (www.facebook.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEJeqUFgKjd7qljedAUsl7x2Hn22Q&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779293045959&ei=YGlGWNCCLsPgWOrosrAE&url=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/lamb-in-sweater-will-change-how-you-see-pets/,EN,,06/12/2016 08:08,2016-12-04 11:56:52+00:00,c12a9781a0,One Green Planet,,,,,1480856212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a90dfa1935,Homeowners likely on the hook for repairing hazardous forest road - KRQE News 13,"Homeowners likely on the hook for repairing hazardous forest road\n\n\n					\n\n	\n		\n		PLACITAS, N.M. (KRQE) - Neighbors in Placitas are concerned about the safety of a road leading to homes and a popular public trail. They claim the lack of maintenance makes the commute downright dangerous, so who\'s supposed to fix it?\nThe landscape that goes along with living in Placitas is a big draw for people like Joe Fusco.\n\""It\'s well-traveled, there\'s a lot of people here on the weekend,\"" Fusco explained, pointing to a Cibola National Forest trailhead at the top of the road.\nHowever, there\'s one problem. For Fusco and his neighbors, getting home is getting tougher and tougher.\n\""It\'s dicey, it\'s dicey at times,\"" Fusco said, referring to the drive to and from his home. \""What\'s the value of a home up this road if you can\'t get to it?\""\nFusco said Tunnel Springs Road, the route drivers take past homes all the way up to a popular Forest Service trailhead, has deteriorated over the years.\n\""We\'re living with something worse and worse every monsoon season, every winter,\"" Fusco told KRQE News 13.\nWet weather, plus wear and tear from the public make the drive more difficult for nearby residents.\n\""It\'s a safety concern for residents,\"" said Fusco.\nNeighbors are also concerned about fire and rescue potentially not getting quick enough access to the trailhead or homes nearby.\nThe Sandoval County Fire Department told KRQE News 13 the road does present a challenge, however the department does have contingency plans in place so crews can get to patients quickly.\nDuring wet weather especially, Fusco said the road becomes treacherous.\n\""You see a lot of abandoned vehicles past the cattle guard,\"" he recalled. \""It wasn\'t as bad as it is right now up here two and a half years ago.\""\nNeighbors told KRQE News 13 it\'s the public trailhead at the top of Tunnel Springs Road that drives the most traffic in the area, which begs the question, who should be taking care of the road?\n\""If the damage is being done by more cars than live up here, then I think the responsibility is to take care of the general public as well,\"" said Fusco.\nLast week, Sandoval County road crews were out pouring new gravel and grading a portion of Tunnel Springs near 165. However, crews stopped the work less than a quarter mile up the road at Quail Meadow.\nA Sandoval County spokesperson told KRQE News 13 that\'s where the county\'s ownership of the road ends.\n\""Is anyone gonna fix this road?\"" Fusco said he\'s been asking that question of the U.S. Forest Service, since Tunnel Springs is also labeled \'Forest Road 231.\' Fusco also points out U.S. Forest Service logos on both the road signs and the trailhead.\n\""We have the access they\'re saying, but we don\'t have the responsibility,\"" Fusco recalled his correspondence with Forest Service officials via email.\nHe said the Forest Service used to maintain the road all the way up to the trailhead. The past two years, Fusco said, the road appears to have gone forgotten.\nAfter contacting KRQE News 13, Fusco said the Forest Service finally told him it was working with Sandoval County to confirm who owns the road.\n\""I had never heard that in a year until I contacted you,\"" a frustrated Fusco told KRQE News 13. \""It\'d be nice to get just a straight-up answer.\""\nKRQE News 13\'s investigation worked to get that answer.\nThe U.S. Forest Service declined an interview, but a spokesperson said the Forest Service does not own the road, even though the agency\'s signs are all over it.\nIn an email to KRQE News 13, the U.S. Forest Service spokesperson also said they\'re looking up old agreements to see if the Forest Service has any responsibility for maintaining the road.\nTunnel Springs Road\""It\'s just gonna keep getting worse,\"" said Fusco.\nIt could also get expensive for the people who live there. The Forest Service also claims Sandoval County records show it\'s the neighbors who own the road, since property lines of 31 private land owners actually extend to the center of the road.\n\""Neighbors have had to do all the work themselves,\"" Fusco said.\nHe and others question why neighbors should have to foot the bill and pave the way for the public to access a National Forest.\n\""I think that\'s just private owners throwing away money because it\'s just gonna get bad again, because it\'s the general public that\'s coming up and tearing it up again,\"" Fusco added.\nNeighbors like Fusco hope they can find a solution with the U.S. Forest Service before things get worse.\n\""At one point is it gonna be unpassable?\"" Fusco asked.\nNeighbors who spoke to KRQE News 13 said they were never under the impression the road was their responsibility when they moved in or built there homes near Tunnel Springs.\nA spokeswoman with the U.S. Forest Service sent KRQE News 13 the following statement:\nThank you for contacting us regarding the Tunnel Springs Road.  At this time, we are working to clarify ownership.  Forest Service ownership begins near the trailhead, and the Forest Service uses the road to maintain the trailhead.  Until now, no issues have been raised that would prohibit us or the public from driving to the trailhead.  Legal access is not the same as legal ownership.\nWe do not have the authority or responsibility to maintain a road that we do not own.  According to records at the Sandoval County Assessor\'s Office, the road is privately owned by approximately 31 adjacent landowners whose property extends to the center line of the road.\nThe road has been maintained by the Forest Service intermittently in the past.  We are trying to verify the agreements that were in place at that time and those that remain in place to determine if it is our responsibility to maintain the road.\nCertainly, we share the public\'s safety concern about the road condition and we are gathering the legal information that we need to determine who is responsible for road maintenance.\n??

As the layers behind the cloning conspiracy have been painfully peeled back over the course of four seasons, the status quo has never stayed stable for long. As the fourth season comes to an end (with the fifth officially being the show\'s last), Tatiana Maslany[2] and company find themselves in truly dire straits. Fans should have known that \""From Dancing Mice To Psychopaths\"" was never going to end well, but ultimately we\'re left with even more questions than before. Is Cosima actually going to die after seasons of teasing her demise? Did the neolutionist founder, P.T. Westmoreland, really find the secret to immortality through genetic manipulation? Where the hell is Cal (Michiel Huisman)? Where are these other clones that Kira (Styler Wexler) alluded to? But, hey, at least Delphine\'s (Evelyne Brochu) back!\nAfter a season of mostly unity, all of the clones end up scattered and in peril. Donnie (Kristian Bruun[3]) and Alison are hiding out with Helena in her woodland hovel, shivering over bowls of venison stew. Krystal has apparently joined the fold, although she might not realize that yet. Sarah is trapped on the island, bleeding out after her violent confrontation with Rachel. Cosima is reunited with her beloved Delphine, but appears to be on death\'s door. Considering all of the controversy surrounding lesbian deaths on television[4] this year, it is probably for the best for the dreadlocked scientist to once again be spared. And Rachel... well, Rachel has come out on top.\nBBC America\nWhile Evie Cho (Jessalyn Wanlim) and Susan Duncan (Rosemary Dunsmore) were a fun distraction, they never had the heft of villainy that Rachel has come to command. With the (murdered) Cho out of the picture at Brightborn, Rachel steps into that power vacuum with even more clout than before. As she informs her fellow Neolutionists that human cloning is back on the table and that they won\'t be wasting their time with simply modifying genes, you believe her screams that she is going to turn her fellow clones into lab rats. With Rachel back in fighting form, the brief alliance is definitely a thing of the past. Wars between siblings have taken place since Cain and Abel, and Rachel\'s war on the rest of the Leda clones is sure to be at great cost. While I will miss the hilarious juxtaposition between the punk rock Sarah and Felix (Jordan Gavaris) and the sleek Rachel and Ira (Ari Millen), the prospect of returning to clone versus clone for the final season is an exciting one.\n\n			References^ Orphan Black (uproxx.com)^ Tatiana Maslany (uproxx.com)^ Kristian Bruun (uproxx.com)^ all of the controversy surrounding lesbian deaths on television (www.hollywoodreporter.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNHoXvngGTdfSOpgc-u9Z8o8u6UxVw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779133244756&ei=7PBkV5CaO62gzAabwa7IDA&url=http://uproxx.com/tv/orphan-black-season-four-finale-review/,EN,,18/06/2016 07:06,2016-06-17 11:22:05+00:00,7903d30a98,UPROXX,,,,,1466169725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a complete coincidence, I was just relaxing on the deck in the sun,\"" he says to mbl.is. \nThe 22° halo he captured on camera is an optical phenomenon that belongs to the family of ice crystal halos, in the form of ar ring with a radius of approximately 22° around the sun or moon. It forms as the sunlight or moonlight is refracted in millions of hexagonalice crysals suspended in the atmosphere. \nThe couple said that observing the halo , which faded after around 20 minutes, had been quite an experience. \""It\'s a phenomenon we had heard of but had never seen before.\""",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNF2MQ9Odj23YUJdiCsPg4EzfvxMpQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779187086026&ei=ZPG7V7j2Cq3WzAaG6q4o&url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/nature_and_travel/2016/08/22/halo_over_thingvellir_national_park/,EN,,23/08/2016 07:06,2016-08-22 09:09:35+00:00,7903d30a98,Iceland Monitor,,,,,1471864175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She\'s the director of the Wichita Brazos Museum and Cultural Center. Established in 2009, it chronicles the history of the area, and highlights some of the characters who\'ve called Knox County home.That includes the wildlife.\""Yeah, he\'d been run over,\"" she continued, then chuckled. \""He looks pretty good there.\""The lizard appeared to be sunning himself on a flat rock along a streambed. But he wasn\'t the smallest of 14 or so mounted animals on display.Buy PhotoA horned toad found by Mary Jane Young, the director of the Wichita Brazos Museum and Cultural Center, which she included in the museum\'s wildlife display, May 4, 2017. (Photo: Ronald W.

They joined a buffalo, whitetail deer, coyote, armadillo and several others, all occupying a large corner of the museum meant to mimic the wilderness just a few hundred yards away.\""We bought these from Ronnie Urbanczyk over at Munday, he\'s a taxidermist over there but he doesn\'t do this work anymore,\"" she said.The bison was being harvested by the Lowrance Ranch in Truscott, and they gifted the hide to the museum.

Hays St. and the museum is open 1-5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.But a bison isn\'t the only thing of interest in the museum from the Lowrance Ranch. One of my favorite pieces is the longhorn hide emblazoned with a map of Texas showing all the counties outlined. Within the borders of each is displayed the first official brand in the county and to whom it was registered.

Joe dressed in U.S. Navy dungarees - I briefly flashed-back to being a kid AND wearing that same uniform 10 years later - were being returned to the folks who\'d loaned them to the museum.In their place is a collection of quilts and bedcoverings made by Knox County residents. Several are friendship quilts with the names either stitched on or written in ink.One celebrates the 150th birthday of the state of Texas. The Sesquicentennial quilt was made in Knox City by Allie Mae Watson in 1986 and was raffled as part of the county\'s celebration of the event.David and Mary Kyle won the quilt. After their deaths in the mid-1990s, the quilt passed to their daughter Kathryn who donated the quilt to the museum in their memory.The oldest one isn\'t a quilt at all, but a coverlet made by Rachel Anne Goodnight. Young said they estimated Goodnight completed it in 1845 when she was 20 years old, probably while still living in her native Kentucky.\""She married Archibald Bedford and the Bedfords settled the town of Benjamin,\"" Young said, herself descended from a Bedford. \""She was born on Dec. 8th, 1825, and married April 12th, 1855.\""What makes the coverlet unique is not what it\'s made from, but how it was made and by whom.\""She raised the sheep and sheared them herself, she washed the wool in the stream and gathered the needed roots and plants from the forest and her home garden to make the dyes herself,\"" Young said, reading from a history. \""She dyed the wool, spun it into thread, then wove the original white and colored thread into rows on her loom for each of the two strips that made this throw.\""Lots of people make blankets. Few do it from the ground up. Read or Share this story: http://arnne.ws/2sRVvLv",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEEJEoW2FFa4OfDbH9YNV_gJq1TOw&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=BD0-WbjqDoXKW-SzrYgK&url=http://www.reporternews.com/story/news/columnists/big-country-journal/2017/06/11/wild-and-wooly-display-benjamin/379814001/,EN,,12/06/2017 07:04,2017-06-11 20:49:11+00:00,7903d30a98,ReporterNews.com,,,,,1497221351,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

b9a1c3d748,Expert: Upgrade Facilities forCow Comfort - Lancaster Farming,"Expert: Upgrade Facilities forCow Comfort | Southern Edition\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                FREDERICK, Md. - Veterinarian Nigel Cook said facilities on dairy farms have been holding farmers back from providing maximum comfort to their animals.\""We still want cows to rest for 12 hours a day,\"" Cook said at the recent Maryland Dairy Convention in Frederick.Cook is a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.He talked about four issues - cow\'s time budget, cow transitions, stall comfort and thermal comfort - and how each can affect a cow and its production.\""The prefresh pen is a significant bottleneck for us,\"" Cook said. \""This is the only pen where the cow decides when she will leave as you have to wait for the cow to calve, which creates a problem. Every cow in the herd goes through that pen, so it influences multiple lactations. The weekly rate of calving varies enormously over the course of a year, and we want to build a pen to accommodate the surges.\""Cook said every cow needs a quiet place to calve with limited disturbance from humans and other cows to ensure as natural a birth as possible with a lowered risk for dystocia and stillbirth.\""If we build to average calving, by definition we are overstocked half the time. We should overbuild to 1.3 to 1.5 times the average rate of calving, allowing at least 100 square feet of bedded pack per cow,\"" he said. \""To help you figure it out, we have a pen size calculator available on I-Tunes.\""Cook outlined three main strategies for processing cows through the prefresh pen: traditional, sequential and all out. The traditional method uses a single pen.\""It needs to be designed from head to tail so that a person can see if the cows are calving without having to go into the pen,\"" he said. \""You move a cow to the calving area and then to the maternity area, so it is simple to manage the situation. As the herds have gotten larger they get pretty big. Some have 400 cows in a pen and that is hard to spot a single cow in that size pen.\""Cook likes the sequential approach.\""You take the original prefresh pen and you split it up into cows and heifers, or divide that from a three-week stay into three pens of one week,\"" he said. \""The next batch of heifers come into this pen and displace those that are there into the next pen and so on. The cows stay in the same group and work toward the calving area, which becomes a much more efficient use of labor.\""An all-out system is a week\'s worth of calving.\""When you have a group of 10 to 12 cows, you move them into a bedded pack pen and they spend the whole prefresh time in a socially stable group and calve in that pen,\"" he said. \""This makes them more calm and comfortable during their stay in the prefresh pen.\""A cow\'s proper time budget ensures good milk production.\""If the cows spend 2 1/2 hours socializing and drinking, 4 1/2 hours eating, two hours standing in the stall and if we can get them back to the stall after milking within three hours, per day they can spend 12 hours resting,\"" he said. \""The three hours milking is the maximum hours out of the pen. This is not just milking time; you have to allow for transfer time of at least 10 minutes to get to the parlor and back. The time out of the pen has become a limiting factor for dairies. We are spending on average 90 minutes out of the stall per milking, and we have pushed this too far. The maximum group size should be 3.8 times the parlor size.\""When a cow stands up she moves 2 feet to the front, and this lunge has to be accommodated when designing stalls.\""We spent a lot of time trying to assess what a cow needs for a comfortable place to lie down,\"" he said. \""We need to allow the lunge and allow that head to come down and that front leg to launch forward to get that weight off the back feet to stand up. If you don\'t allow for that, it is incredibly challenging for this cow to be able to use this space.\""Cook said a stall design should allow the cow to lie down and keep herself clean.\""We want to start with the stall loop design. The anatomy of the loop is important. We make sure that we don\'t get the cow\'s leg under the lower loop,\"" he said. \""Make it 5 inches off the ground and she will get out. The upper-edge back should be about 12 inches from the floor and make sure that that is up so high that the bar sits in the comfort area where the cow\'s head will go but not so low that she will try to step over it. A matter of inches can make an enormous amount of difference as will the angle of the bar.\""You want to tell the cow where to lie down,\"" he said. \""Big stalls do not make cows lay diagonally; the junk in front does that.\""Cook recommends single beam or double bar mounting systems so you don\'t have to put things into the ground and you can move things around to accommodate anything you may need.\""The surface is the most important part of the stall,\"" he said. \""Sand bedding got us closest to 12 hours of rest per cow. This beats manure solids, organic bedding and mattresses, and 60 to 70 percent of herds in Wisconsin are using sand with lower cell counts compared to the others.\""Cook said he is convinced that lameness lowers milk production and that sand reduces knee swelling.\""As an industry, we cannot tolerate 30 percent of our herd with severe hoc injuries, swelling and ulcerations,\"" he said. \""I realize that moving the deep loose bedding, it is a pain and difficult. People also use sand, straw and lime mixtures as well as peat moss. Put that in twice a week and you have to just level it with a rake. Don\'t churn it up from below.\""Thermal comfort and ventilation are all about creating a microclimate for the cow. He said there are issues with natural ventilation. \""Ventilation is the provision of fresh air into the building space, not just moving the air around the building,\"" he said. \""The cows are quite comfortable with cold but they are not so good on the upper end and are quite uncomfortable in higher temperatures. Higher-production cows are producing more heat than their less-productive sisters. They accumulate heat during these resting bouts of about a degree increase per hour.\""Cook said that as facilities have gotten bigger, natural ventilation does not work as well as it used to.\""Make sure it works as well in the winter as it does in the summer. Optimal fan speed moves air at 400 feet per minute or 2 meters per second on each fan,\"" he said. \""We have overestimated the throw distance of the fans and have not made certain that the 400-foot-per-minute is over all rows of stalls. We want to focus on air changes per hour, mechanical ventilation specs and body mass heat transfer. You need fast-moving air in the resting space, sufficient air changers per hour to remove the heat and moisture, and make sure it works as well in the winter as it does in the summer.\""The dairy convention\'s theme was improving performance through better cow well-being.\""We have 130 registered today and there are over 419 family dairy farms in Maryland,\"" said Diane Flickinger, president of the Maryland Dairy Industry Association. She also operates Flickstead Dairy Farm near Union Bridge. \""This is a regional event that we offer for the dairy industry that is open to anyone in the dairy industry. I often tell people that this is a wonderful opportunity for a day\'s education between a morning and evening milking.\""Rick Hemphill is a freelance writer covering western Maryland and Northern Virginia.Photo by Rick HemphillNigel Cook, University of Wisconsin, Madison, talks about proper cow housing at the Maryland Dairy Convention in Frederick.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNEUOaXh8oC_6DNWBw0gDBEcV2qumg&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=N8W7WLDbBsyoWpqBirgJ&url=http://www.lancasterfarming.com/news/southern_edition/expert-upgrade-facilities-forcow-comfort/article_34c3500b-f39d-5295-be71-1dfdf3ba63a8.html,EN,,05/03/2017 08:00,2017-03-04 09:06:19+00:00,09f6823154,Lancaster Farming,,,,,1488621979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bc47fca0af,"1 dead, at least 8 injured in Saskatchewan prison riot - CBC.ca","1 dead, at least 8 injured in Saskatchewan prison riot - Saskatchewan\n\n\n			 			A prisoner was killed and several people were injured during a riot at Saskatchewan Penitentiary on Wednesday. \nPrison officials said three inmates were stabbed at some point during the riot in the Prince Albert prison\'s medium-security unit. \nJason Leonard Bird, 43, was pronounced dead after he was brought to hospital by paramedics. \nTwo other inmates were taken to hospital in serious condition.  \nJames Bloomfield, regional president with the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers, said that in the days leading to the riot there had been concerns by inmates regarding the portion size of meals. \nA confrontation began around 1 p.m. CST Wednesday, following lunch, when inmates would normally be heading back to their cells. \n\""However, the inmates, at that point, refused to lock up,\"" said Bloomfield. The number of inmates refusing to lock up ranged from 185 to 200, he said. \nNegotiators brought in  \nGuards in the medium-security unit have limited tools at their disposal, Bloomfield said. \n\""The tools we have on us are handcuffs. We have pepper spray. We have stab-resistant vests.\"" \nAs the inmates refused to lock up in their cells, negotiators were brought in. \n\n A prisoner has been killed at Saskatchewan Penitentiary in an incident that triggered a riot. (Thomas Porter/Canadian Press)\n \n\""The negotiators quickly realized that was not going to be fruitful, and the emergency response teams were called in.\"" \nWhile emergency teams were being called, Bloomfield said, the inmates began to riot. \n\""They smashed out all the lights, all the cameras, all the windows.\"" \nThe inmates also set up barricades. \n3 inmates found stabbed \nBloomfield said that as the emergency responders breached the barricades, it was discovered that three inmates had been stabbed. Those inmates were taken to hospital, but one - Bird - was pronounced dead. \nShots were fired by guards as they took control of the area, sending five to hospital. None of the injuries is considered life-threatening. \n\""In gaining control, they did fire shots down range,\"" said Bloomfield. \""That resulted in six inmates being hit with pellets. It\'s not a direct aim at an individual and fire at them; it\'s a different type of shot that we used in this to suppress the crowd and to hold them from charging.\"" \nThe maximum-security unit was subsequently locked down at 3:30 p.m. as a precautionary measure.  \nThe prison is now under control, says Correctional Service Canada, but visits are still suspended. \nPolice and the correctional service are investigating.

Amos Peterson is the leader of FarrPro, which has developed a replacement for heat lamps in farrowing facilities. The invention is designed to help pork producers reduce both mortality and energy costs.\n\""It\'s an enclosed micro-climate that evenly heats the piglets throughout the first three weeks of their lives,\"" Peterson says. FarrPro was part of the Iowa AgriTech Accelerator Class of 2017. The Des Moines-based program is designed to connect ag-tech startups with mentors and investors. Peterson says FarrPro is just now beginning a pilot project, but he calls the preliminary data on his product \""very encouraging.\""\nHe says the piglets \""seem to really like\"" the enclosures. Peterson says fundraising will be critical over the next year as he hopes FarrPro units will eventually be used by swine operations around the world.\n\""The launch throughout 2018 - we\'re hoping to sell about 1,000 units to early test partners and 10,000 through other distribution methods,\"" Peterson says.\nThe Iowa AgriTech Accelerator will begin accepting applications for its Class of 2018 in January.\n(story courtesy of Radio Iowa/Brownfield Ag News)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNH_5d6tzi0ezBPfjIyngoCNvihqEQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&ei=X2keWoj6DsP_zAavh6PgBw&url=https://kmch.com/iowa-ag-startup-develops-replacement-for-heat-lamps-in-farrowing-barns/,EN,,29/11/2017 08:00,2017-11-28 16:12:27+00:00,a83cc6376b,kmch.com,,,,,1511889147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The population holds its breath. The events of the last week have for some been the redemption of a tryst with destiny. For others it has been what the TV serials call a cliffhanger.\r\n\r\nBut this week it ended in defeat. England was beaten by its European rival and that was only football when it lost to Croatia in the semifinal of the football World Cup. But the nation was fixated, analogous to Nero watching football while Rome burns.\r\n\r\nIn the world of politics, Britain is in turmoil. The government, led by Prime Minister Theresa May, faces challenges from within her own party, from the British Parliament, from the countries and negotiators of the European Union and perhaps from the democratic will of the British electorate.\r\n\r\nThe matter of belonging and partnering with Europe has bedeviled every Tory government since the time Ted Heath was PM, be it Margaret Thatcher, John Major or James Cameron\'s government. Not that the division of opinion hasn\'t reared its head in the Labour Party, but it didn\'t threaten the governments of Tony Blair or Gordon Brown.\r\n\r\nMr Cameron called the 2016 referendum, hoping to end the divisions, believing that the populace would follow his lead and vote to remain. It didn\'t. The Brexitiers won by a narrow margin of 52 to 48 per cent of vote. Mr Cameron resigned and Theresa May, who had voted to remain, took charge of the party and government and declared that she would implement the will of the 52 per cent despite her own vote and advocacy against leaving. \""Brexit means Brexit\"" was her opening statement.\r\n\r\nShe appointed several prominent Brexiteers from her own party to her Cabinet. Then began the very complex task of withdrawing from a continent that buys most of Britain\'s exports - goods and services. British businesses are umbilically tied to European manufacture and markets. The Brexit voters, free of the actual responsibility of knowing about or disentangling Britain from its commitments and its dependency on European markets and security networks, voted for the slogans that the Brexit lobby put out:\r\n\r\n\""Take back control of our borders!\"" -- a euphemism for keep Europeans and foreigners out.\r\n\r\n\""Restore power to the British Parliament\"" despite the fact that very few who voted for the slogan can say which regulation of the European Union was disputed or challenged by Britain.\r\n\r\nPoor Ms May was left with the task of solving the insoluble and came up with a plan which she put to her whole Cabinet on Friday, July 6, at her country retreat, Chequers. The Cabinet agreed with this \""Chequers Deal\"" -- until a day or two later when her senior minister for negotiating Brexit, David Davis, and his deputy resigned. Mr Davis said he would be in charge of negotiating a deal which was in all but name a deal to stay in the customs union and close to the single European market which would mean, despite assurances from Ms May, that Britain would not be free to cut trade deals with countries outside Europe.\r\n\r\nMr Davis has been in charge of the negotiations with the EU and knows the tenor of their concerns. He maintains that the Chequers deal is a dead duck as Europe would either water it down, virtually pulling Britain back into the EU,\r\nor refusing it altogether. This would result in \""no deal\"".\r\n\r\nBritain would then have to leave Europe without a customs or trading agreement. Having resigned, Mr Davis was immediately seen as the hero of the \""no deal\"" and would be in a strong position in the country which voted, even if marginally, for a deal which would decisively keep immigrants out and make Britain the isolated island it so foolishly voted by a slender majority to be. But there were other lions of the \""no deal\"" camp in the Cabinet and they had to take a decision on whether they would let Mr Davis assume the \""no deal\"" mantle. One of them, the maverick politician and foreign secretary in Ms May\'s Cabinet, Boris Johnson, handed in his resignation letter. He can\'t stay with the Chequers deal whose precariousness, with MPs of the ruling party threatening to vote against it and with the almost certain rejection of it by the Europeans, could bring the Theresa May government down.\r\n\r\nThat could signal a leadership contest within the Tory party or it could result in the dissolution of Parliament and a general election. By all accounts from within the Tory party, Mr Johnson doesn\'t have the numbers to promote him into the leadership so he has found himself in a limbo of posture and ambition.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know if Ms May believes in omens, but if she does she ought to take the defeat of England by a junior member of the European Union seriously. Croatia is not Germany, but as one of the 27 states of the EU it has the prerogative of voting against the deal she proposes and its veto can derail the process.\r\n\r\nGood counsel would advise her to think about more immediate threats. She has replaced Mr Davis and Mr Johnson with Brexiteers who profess to support her Chequers deal down the line. The suspicion remains that very many in her Cabinet are not convinced that the deal delivers what the narrow majority of xenophobes and \""make-Britain-great-again\""-types want, but they will remain loyal to Ms May because they fear that her downfall would trigger an election which their party would lose.\r\n\r\nEven more chaos for Britain would follow as the coalition of Labour, Scottish Nationalists and Liberal Democrats would be as divided in its approach to Europe as the ruling Tories are today.",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGRnupM_xHg1gwsqUXhxltAdqaoQA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779960686731&ei=BsVJW5j3Kc3vzAbBtqG4DA&url=http://www.asianage.com/opinion/oped/140718/chequers-deal-a-dead-duck-for-uk.html,EN,,14/07/2018 09:38,2018-07-13 17:22:23+00:00,ece86a9f0a,The Asian Age,,,,,1531509743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

April the giraffe\'s handlers said Wednesday, March 29th \""the countdown to calf has begun!\""[2]\nZoo officials said Wednesday they \""cannot confirm active labor,\"" but said \""we do have discharge that would suggest the countdown to calf has begun!\"" They added that \""mammary development is on point,\"" and \""our team and vet are on standby.\""\nThey noted that \""we could be hours away or days,\"" and encouraged everyone to stay tuned!\nWe should note, there are THREE days until the month of April!\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		Below are some things to know about April, courtesy Animal Adventure Park:\nApril is 15. This will be her fourth calf. April has never lost a calf nor had a stillborn. Oliver, April\'s partner is five. This will be his first calf.\nThe giraffes have some of the biggest pens in the nation (square foot per animal). Animal Adventure Park takes pride in their indoor housing and the level of enrichment and care to keep the giraffes happy and healthy.\nThe calf will weigh around 150 pounds and will be about 6 feet tall at birth. The front hooves will come out first followed by the snout.\nMom will naturally raise the calf. Weaning could take between 6-10 months, maybe longer. Animal Adventure Park officials will not rush this process. It is just a documented range of captive weaning.\nOnce the calf is born, there will be a contest to name it.\nThe keepers will go in with April occasionally to clean her pen and give her treats (but not Oliver). He is a bull - and a bull is a bull is a bull, officials said.\nGiraffes are pregnant for 15 months.\nUpon naturally weaning, the calf will move on to another facility to start a breeding program there. Animal Adventure Park officials cannot retain offspring, as it would lead to incestuous mating and undermine the genetics of the program and species.\nThose \""things\"" on their heads are called ossicones.\nBulls (male giraffes) only really care about two things - fighting and \""the unmentionable.\"" Oliver may share space with April, but for short periods. Bulls take no part in rearing young.\nThe giraffes eat hay and a specialized giraffe diet, but love romaine lettuce and carrot treats.\nApril\'s water source, enrichment, and solo hay feeder are out of sight of the camera view.\nThis will be Animal Adventure Park\'s first giraffe calf.\n\n		\n			42.154179\n			-75.669017\n		\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n\n\n\n	References^ CLICK HERE to WATCH Animal Adventure Park\'s Giraffe Cam LIVE!  (www.youtube.com)^ \""the countdown to calf has begun!\"" (animaladventurepark.com)",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNGXwScX9Qh27Uy3x40kADwA1aLZoQ&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779437651387&ei=zK_cWKiPPMiyWZevlagI&url=http://fox6now.com/2017/03/29/3-days-until-april-april-the-giraffes-handlers-say-the-countdown-to-calf-has-begun/,EN,,30/03/2017 07:12,2017-03-29 19:33:54+00:00,cf49dae16b,fox6now.com,,,,,1490823234,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e2f6e80683,Pregnant Amy Schumer hospitalized for hyperemesis - Motherly Inc.,"Pregnant Amy Schumer hospitalized for hyperemesis ?\n\n\n\n        No pregnancy and birth are exactly the same. Each of us has a unique story, and so do our babies. As Hilary Duff proves, a mother\'s second birth story isn\'t a just a rerun of her first. Motherhood changes people, and for Duff welcoming her second child, daughter Banks, at age 31 was a very different experience than birthing her son, Luka, when she was 24. She went from a hospital to a home birth she explains in a two part interview for the Informed Pregnancy podcast. And although Duff admits that at some points in her home birth she was scared and asked herself why she wasn\'t in a hospital \""with all the drugs,\"" she says she\'s so glad she did it and would totally do it again. She\'s opened up about how she came to want a home birth, what surprised her about it and what helped her during her labor-and it\'s quite a birth story. \n                Looking backDuring her first pregnancy, Duff says she started out wanting an elective C-section. She was 23 when she and ex-husband Mike Comrie found out they were expecting, and she didn\'t have a lot of peers who were having kids. Her mom had C-sections for Duff and her siblings, and Duff thought that\'s what she would do, too. But in her second trimester she decided that she would try delivering first. She had an epidural for Luka\'s birth but he was born without a C-section. More than five years later, during her pregnancy with Banks, Duff watched Ricki Lake\'s 2008 documentary \""The Business of Being Born\"" and started considering a different kind of birth plan the second time around. \""I just started thinking that I wanted a different experience,\"" Duff tells the host of Informed Pregnancy, prenatal chiropractor, childbirth educator and labor doula Dr. Elliot Berlin.\""I\'m older now. I love motherhood more than anything-I never thought I would be this way, I never thought I could be so happy and so fulfilled. It\'s not easy, because being a parent is not easy, but it\'s just a joy. And I thought to myself that I want to like fully get the full experience of what it is like to bring a baby into the world.\""\nHaving support from Matt, Haylie and her momWhen Duff brought the idea up with her partner, Matthew Koma, he \""was amazing,\"" she explains. He had some questions, but was down to support Duff in her birthing choices. Duff says she thinks her mom Susan and sister Haylie were \""nervous to think about not being in a hospital\"" at first, but once Duff explained things a bit and got to talk to them about her doula and midwives, Haylie got really pumped about the idea. \""She was so supportive and amazing. I think my mom was a little more worried but she got behind me,\"" Duff recalls, adding that because her mom had C-sections herself, even seeing Duff deliver Luka vaginally in a hospital was a bit of a different experience for her, so being there for the home birth was taking things to an unfamiliar level. \""The first time she saw me having a contraction in the house she was cooking bacon for Luka,\"" Duff explains, adding that she had to pause the conversation she was having and squat down during the contraction. \""My mom was like, \'Oh no, oh no, oh no\' and I was like, \'Mom, you can\'t do that all day...She got used to it. She\'s my mom and just having the comfort your mom brings was important to me.\"" Having her mom and her sister there was important to Duff, who was able to labor upstairs (where Koma had dragged the birthing pool out of Luka\'s room, where it had been temporarily used as a trampoline, and got it set up in Duff\'s room) when she needed to and then come downstairs to chill with her mom, sister and son when she could. Even though she started feeling the contractions in the middle of the night, she still wasn\'t in active labor by the time her mom was cooking bacon for Luka in the morning. \""I think that was the most surprising part for me, thinking that it was going to progress a lot faster than it did and it just didn\'t,\"" she explains, adding that at one point she went back downstairs and her son was watching a Marvel movie on TV. \""When I pictured my birth I didn\'t picture watching Guardians of the Galaxy on TV. Luka was like explaining the characters to me,\"" she explains.\nHer birth team Duff\'s partner, son, sister and mother weren\'t the only ones in the house with her the day Banks was born. She had a doula, a birth photographer who is also a doula and three midwives. \""I definitely got through some contractions alone,\"" says Duff \""[But] I needed a tribe of people.Her people helped her in the moments when things got really scary. Like when she worried she wasn\'t progressing fast enough, or when the pain was intense. Duff found squatting, sitting on a birthing ball, and using a heating pad were all helpful at different points in the process. \""Also some oils, I smelled a lot of clary sage oil and that felt really good,\"" she explains. \""I don\'t know why it felt really good to me.\""What didn\'t feel good was being told to relax. \""Any time someone would tell me to relax I felt like I would punch them in the face,\"" she says, adding that Koma used the phrase one too many times.\""He was like, \'just relax babe\', and I was like \'you\'re gonna die if you say that\'!\"" At the suggestion of one of her midwives, Duff started imagining herself melting into the bed with each contraction, and found that was helpful, too. And although her contractions never got as long or as close together as her team expected them to, one of her midwives eventually gave her the good news that she was progressing. \""She looks at me and she\'s like, \'you want to go get in the tub?\' and I just started crying,\"" Duff recalls. \""It was such a happy moment.\""\nIn the tubDuff says when she was moved to the birthing tub, her brain really let her body take over. After the birth she estimated she was in the tub for about 30 minutes, but Koma told her it was really more like 90. \""My brain disconnected,\"" she says. \""I remember telling myself that I don\'t need to be here for all of this.\""At one point, she looked at one of her midwives and said, \'I\'m really scared right now.\"" Exhausted and unable to hold her body up as she channelled all her energy into pushing, Duff let her team hold her legs and arms while she pushed.\nHaving a babyWhen Banks\' head emerged, it didn\'t feel quite like the birth videos Duff has seen.\""Honestly, when I got her head out I was shocked by the feelings,\"" she told Dr. Berlin. \""I\'ve seen women reach down and pull their baby out, and I couldn\'t do that...I was like, okay I\'m there, I\'m there, I\'ve got to finish this job, but it was like really intense. It wasn\'t pleasant at that point. I think I wasn\'t fully in my headspace, my body was doing what it needed to do. It wasn\'t until her body came out that I could like want to grab onto her and bring her up out of the water.\"" Baby Banks needed some breaths from a midwife when she was first pulled from the water, but because her son Luka was also born looking a little blue, Duff says she wasn\'t freaked out. Once she figured out how to breathe, little Banks did \""the most amazing thing,\"" her mama recalls. \""They hand her to me, and I\'m looking at her-and you know, babies are like floppy little worms, they just don\'t have any control-and she reaches up both of her arms right at my neck as to give me a hug. It was so clearly a hug.\"" Duff says the hug made her feel like baby Banks was saying something: \""Like, good [teamwork] mom, we did it.\"" After the birth, Duff\'s team made her a smoothie using a chunk of raw placenta (a practice that the CDC recommends against, but many women choose to partake in).She says she\'s not trying to push her choices on anyone else, and that she wants mothers to feel supported in whatever choices they make for themselves. \""It\'s a very personal choice and it\'s not for everyone, that\'s for sure, she says.Duff says that although she was at times overwhelmed and scared, she\'s so happy that Banks\' birth story unfolded at home, and she would do it all over again.To hear the whole interview, check out the Informed Pregnancy podcast. \n\n                You might also like: Hilary Duff\'s daughter is here (and her name is perfect) ?Hilary Duff\'s simple, powerful honesty: \'Pregnancy is hard\'Hilary Duff is pregnant with her second child-and it\'s a girl! ?",http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNF8T7at1DnOa_X9rnhUwIrIW2R71A&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52780103582015&ei=PHvuW8DeH8zmzQaC7oOQAQ&url=https://www.mother.ly/news/pregnant-amy-schumer-hospitalized-for-hyperemesis,EN,,16/11/2018 08:08,2018-11-15 20:04:55+00:00,411af49341,Motherly Inc.,,,,,1542315895,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NS68EEL05W,Sabah workshop on being crisis proof,"KOTA KINABALU, 29 May 2019: Sabah Tourism
Board hosted a  ‘Risk Mitigation and
Crisis Recovery Management’ seminar last week coordinated by the Pacific Asia
Travel Association.
Around 40 travel industry professionals
from Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam attended the two-day workshop that provided
insights on how destinations and organisations should handle a crisis.
Sabah Tourism Board acting general manager,
Noredah Othman said: “Sabah has faced many challenges such as economic
downturn, the SARS epidemic, bird flu and earthquakes. However, I’m glad that
the Sabah tourism industry, both public and private sector, are resilient and
cohesive in working together. 
“Through this workshop, we hope that we can
develop a strong and effective plan and set up a team in charge of risk mitigation
and crisis recovery in the near future to ensure the safety of our tourists
visiting Sabah.”
The programme was led by Winning Edge Thailand managing director, Bert van Walbeek and Crisis Communications Consulting Singapore managing consultant, John Bailey.
“An increasingly important destination
selection criteria for tourists is safety and security and Sabah’s tourism
providers must emphasise this more convincingly as a competitive instrument,”
said van Walbeek.",https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2019/05/sabah-workshop-on-being-crisis-proof/,EN,,28/05/2019 23:16,2019-05-28 21:00:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.ttrweekly.com,,,,,1559084400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Y13XZ11BDB,Characterization of the Mechanical Properties for Cranial Bones,"Due to ethical reasons, piglets have often been employed as surrogates for children in biomechanics studies. To our knowledge, no public data detailing the mechanical properties of cranial bones for 8-week-old piglets are available. In this study, tensile tests were conducted on frontal, parietal, and occipital bone specimens derived from 8-week-old piglets at different strain rates. The cranial bone specimens exhibit obvious linear elastic behavior and an insignificant plastic stage prior to failure. The mechanical property of the parietal bone is very close to that of the frontal bone, and the property differs significantly from that of the occipital bone. The average elastic modulus and ultimate stress of the parietal/frontal bone are 4.19 times and 2.75 times as high as occipital bone, respectively, whereas the average ultimate strain is about 25% times lower than that of the occipital bone.
In addition, the cranial bone exhibits significant strain-rate characteristics. As the strain rate increases from 0.001 to 10 s-1, the average elastic modulus and ultimate stress of the parietal/frontal and occipital bone increase by about 88% and 59%, and 94% and 96%, respectively. In contrast, the average ultimate strain of the parietal/frontal and occipital bone decreases by about 32% and about 17%, respectively. The quantitative relationship between the mechanical parameters of the cranial bone and the strain rate based on the experimental data is established. A strain-rate-dependent elastic constitutive model was developed through user material subroutine and implemented into LS-DYNA.

People were spotted riding the scooters in banned areas, such as the Tampa Riverwalk, or parking them haphazardly and blocking sidewalks and entryways, Tampa Transportation Director Jean Duncan said.“We’re hoping maybe it’s a little bit of growing pains in the first couple days and we'll see better compliance on the part of the operators as well as the users that we wanted to see from the beginning,” Duncan said. “This looks good on paper, but is it going to work in reality?”The latest transportation fad is solidly in place in several cities, but Tampa has taken its time launching the one-year pilot program, which allows up to 2,400 scooters to operate around town.PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Will scooters help or hurt the way we get around in Tampa Bay? We're about to find outAs of Tuesday, only two companies — Spin and Bird — currently have scooters out on the streets for people to ride. Competitors Lime and Jump, the other two companies approved for the pilot, should be running here soon, Duncan said.The scooters can travel up to 15 mph and are meant to help people get to destinations that are too far to comfortably walk, but not far enough to warrant a car trip. Riders rent the scooters through an app on their smart phone.Spin reported 2,500 trips on its scooters over the weekend. A Bird spokesman said the company does not share ridership numbers.While people can take trips all over the city, there are a few no-ride zones, including the Riverwalk, Bayshore Boulevard and East Seventh Street in Ybor City. The city contacted both Spin and Bird with complaints that people were riding scooters in banned areas. Bird said its app prohibits people from riding there and will slow the vehicle gradually to a full stop when a rider enters one of those zones.“Several riders then think the battery is dead and park it nearby,” Bird representative Servando Esparza wrote in an email to the city. “Most will follow the in-app notifications to move outside the riding zone to continue riding.”Spin shared a similar experience, but made a couple additional tweaks to discourage people from riding in those zones and leaving the scooter behind. Spin representative Dan Fleischbein changed the settings so the company's scooters slow down to 10 mph at Curtis Hixon Park and 3 mph in no-ride zones. He also made the Riverwalk a no-park zone.“It is 3 mph, so it’s not rideable, but forces people to remove them from the Riverwalk,” Flesichbein wrote in an email. “This appears to solve the problem. We are constantly tweaking and adjusting to create a safe, enjoyable experience for riders and non-riders alike.”Currently, people can ride scooters only on the sidewalk. That will change if Gov. Ron DeSantis signs a bill sponsored by State Sen. Jeff Brandes and State Rep. Jackie Toledo. The legislation from the Tampa Bay Republicans allows scooters on streets and bike paths, but leaves the decisions up to local governments.“We thought it was important to get everyone on board early on and make sure that cities have maximum flexibility,” Brandes said.Duncan said the city’s attorneys are meeting this week to see how, if at all, the new law would affect the contract Tampa signed with the four scooter companies.In order to try to crack down on the haphazard parking that plagues many cities, Tampa requires scooters to be placed in pre-determined corrals every day. People can then ride the scooter to whatever location they choose and park it anywhere that isn't blocking walkways and traffic.Duncan said the city had permitted 17 corrals as of Tuesday afternoon, but is approving more each day. That means people can expect to see the number of scooters and the variety of locations grow over the next couple weeks.Collin Sherwin, 41, took a Bird scooter Tuesday from his home near Hyde Park to his office downtown. The 2.3 mile trip cost him $6.11 — only a dollar or so less than an Uber.Sherwin said his trips in other cities, like Austin and San Diego, were cheaper. The scooters cost $1 to start, but then vary on how much they charge per minute. Sherwin said he’s paid around 15 cents a minute previously, but the cost Tuesday came to around 29 cents a minute, according to his receipt.Even though a scooter doesn't save him much money and takes twice as long as an Uber (16 minutes opposed to 8), Sherwin said he still would prefer to scooter to work, if the weather was good.Sherwin, who gave up his car in 2017, said it’s more fun and theoretically a cheaper option than taking a rideshare. But the main reason he prefers his bike or a scooter rental is that he feels more connected to his neighborhood with those than he does in a car.“When I’m on my bike, I see the signs for a cool happy hour or an upcoming event you might miss,” Sherwin said. “The advantage with the scooter is I’m not sweating when I get to work. If I take my bike, there’s a chance I’m gross all day.”Brock Bjorn, 33, hasn't had the chance to ride a scooter yet, but said he spotted two near-accidents heading toward Davis Islands. The first involved two people who looked like they were trying to beat the crosswalk signal but were too late, and another was a driver making a right turn while not paying attention, Bjorn said.Sherwin had a near miss while on his way into work, when a car came close to him while both were making a right turn.Bjorn said he’d be hesitant to ride in a busier area like downtown or South Howard, but would be interested in checking them out while in his neighborhood on Davis Islands.“All progress has it’s early issues,” Bjorn said. “I don't really see any long-term concern aside from them being left in public walkways.”",https://www.tampabay.com/transportation/scooters-have-arrived-on-tampa-sidewalks-and-there-are-growing-pains-20190528/,EN,,28/05/2019 23:48,2019-05-28 20:34:37+00:00,ece86a9f0a,www.tampabay.com,,,,,1559082877,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8UMUFYZWS8,Terpenes Guide: List of 23 Types of the Most Popular Terpenes in Cannabis and CBD Oils,"Terpenes are a group of organic compounds. They’re best-known in the cannabis community for giving the plant’s flowers their unique scent. Although the word terpenes and terpenoids are often used interchangeably, there is a difference between the two: terpenes are the naturally occurring combination of carbon and hydrogen, while terpenoids are terpenes that have been chemically modified, changing the oxygen content of the compound.
Terpenes not only change the scent of the cannabis plant, but they also change its effects. Based on the terpene makeup, quality, and variety in a strain, you might feel different effects. Terpenes can cause one strain to help you feel happy and calm, for example, while another strain makes you feel sleepy.
Today, we’re explaining the most popular types of terpenes – including their unique health benefits backed by modern science.
Types of Terpenes
Bisabolol
Bisabolol is known for its sweet, floral aroma. It may also have anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-nociceptive properties. Bisabolol’s use goes back centuries: cosmetic companies have long used bisabolol for its soothing properties and unique scent. Two major studies from 2009 seem to have reinforced the benefits of bisabolol: researchers in Korea and Brazil found that bisabolol reduced pain and inflammation in mice. Another, more recent study indicated that bisabolol had anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties. Interestingly, the study also showed that traditional anti-microbial topical solutions like tea tree oil were more effective when combined with bisabolol, leading some to believe that bisabolol has synergistic properties and strengthens the medicinal value of other compounds.
Caryophyllene
Caryophyllene is a popular terpene because of its apparent ability to active CB2 receptors throughout the body. Some compare this terpene to CBD because it can eliminate pain, reduce stress, and lower inflammation. Scientific studies have reinforced the idea that caryophyllene is a CB2 agonist with proven anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. Interestingly, studies have also shown that caryophyllene provides full body pain relief. In another study, researchers found that mice who received caryophyllene experienced lower levels of stress. Plus, caryophyllene may also act as a neuroprotectant, strengthening brain cells and reducing degeneration. Caryophyllene may also have antifungal properties, as it’s been shown to inhibit the spread of skin diseases like ring worm by eliminating dermatophytes.
Borneol
Borneol has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 400 years. Also known as moxa, this terpenoid has long been prized for its ability to reduce inflammation, lower anxiety, relieve pain, and reduce the risk of heart diseases. Modern research has indicated that borneol has some powerful health benefits: one study from 2003 confirmed that borneol can numb pain. A separate study from 2013 reinforced this finding, showing that borneol significantly reduced pain and inflammation in mice while also giving patients fewer side effects than traditional medications.
Borneol’s stress relieving properties likely come from its ability to modulate GABA receptors: in a 2004 study, researchers found that borneol positively modulates GABA receptors, thereby reducing stress. Borneol also seems to have powerful effects on the heart. In one study, borneol was able to successfully prevent rats from having a stroke. Researchers have traced this benefit back to the anti-coagulative properties of borneol. Finally, just like bisabolol above, borneol also seems to have powerful synergistic properties: it lowers the blood-brain barrier, making it easier for the body to absorb a higher percentage of the medication patients receive. Borneol can make medicine work more effectively.
Terpinolene
Terpinolene has been linked to anti-cancer properties. It appears to have an ability to reduce the spread of cancer spells. In one study examining the link between terpinolene and cancer, researchers found that terpinolene acts as a “potent antiproliferative agent for brain tumour cells” in mice. In another study, researchers found that terpinolene can also slow the spread of cancer by downregulating certain proteins. In addition to its anti-cancer properties, terpinolene has a proven ability to induce sleep. In a 2013 study, researchers found that mice were able to fall asleep more easily following the nasal delivery of terpinolene. Unlike many of the other terpenes on this list, terpinolene has no known anti-inflammatory or pain-relieving properties. Similar to camphene, terpinolene produces an acrid smoke when burned.
Terpineol
Terpineol is popular among patients using cannabis for medical purposes. The terpene has been linked to a number of powerful therapeutic properties, including reduced pain and inflammation, reduced frequency and intensity of seizures, and anti-bacterial properties, among other benefits. In a study on terpineol in 2007, researchers found that the terpene exhibited significant anti-inflammatory properties when mixed in orange juice. A follow-up study reinforced this benefit by showing that terpineol had powerful anti-inflammatory properties on rats.
That study also found that terpineol protected rats against stomach ulcers. In a 2011 study involving mice, researchers confirmed that terpineol had powerful analgesic effects with limited side effects, indicating that it could be more effective at treating pain than traditional medication. Meanwhile, some patients who suffer from chronic seizures take cannabis strains with high levels of terpineol. When taking the terpene at high doses (100 and 400 mg/kg), terpineol may reduce the severity and frequency of seizures. Finally, terpineol has exhibited anti-microbial properties against multiple microbial strains. A 2014 study found that terpineol derived from essential oil had powerful anti-microbial properties against all tested strains.
Pinene
Pinene is categorized as a ‘bicyclic monoterpene’ chemical compound that includes both alpha-pinene and beta-pinene. It’s a myth that cannabis only includes alpha-pinene: both alpha-pinene and beta-pinene can be found in cannabis, often with similar doses. Pinene is also found in far more than just the cannabis plant. In fact, it’s the most common terpene found in nature. Numerous studies have reinforced the idea that pinene has powerful health benefits. The compound has a proven ability to boost airflow to the lungs, for example, which is why some asthma patients take strains with high levels of pinene. Pinene can also regulate inflammation by modulating the body’s inflammatory response, which is also why some patients take high-pinene strains for osteoarthritis. Separate studies from 2011 and 2012 found that pinene could be used to treat various bacterial infections, including infectious bronchitis viruses. Surprisingly, pinene may also improve brain function by boosting cognitive ability: in one study, pinene was found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain, thereby improving memory retention.
Phytol
Phytol is created when chlorophyll – yes, the same chemical used to create energy in plants – degrades. Phytol is also found in high levels in green tea. Studies have linked phytol consumption to reduced pain and inflammation. In a 2013 study published in Neuroscience Journal, researchers discovered that phytol had “pronounced antinociceptive effects” in mice along with “antioxidant properties”. A follow-up study seemed to reinforce these benefits, showing that phytol could “inhibit inflammatory response by reducing cytokine production and oxidative stress”. Today, patients may take phytol-intensive strains of cannabis to reduce pain and inflammation throughout the body. However, more research is needed in humans before these benefits are confirmed.
Phellandrene
Phellandrene is best-known among the cannabis community for its distinctive citrus-y, peppermint smell. Although phellandrene has a pleasant smell, it has been linked to fewer benefits than most other terpenes on this list. In one of the few studies on phellandrene to date, researchers found that the terpene may reduce pain sensitivity and boost energy levels. Some evidence also suggests that phellandrene can reduce depression and have antihyperalgesic effects. The study above specifically analyzed alpha-phellandrene, although the phellandrene family includes both alpha-phellandrene and beta-phellandrene.
Nerolidol
Have you ever smelt a strain of cannabis that has a uniquely woody aroma? The woody scent in cannabis often comes from a terpene called nerolidol. This terpene is an antifungal agent that also appears to have natural sleep aid properties. One study published in the Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin in 2007 found that nerolidol was clinically effective at treating skin lesions in guinea pigs when applied within one week of the lesion. A more recent study from 2013 explored the effects of nerolidol on the rains of mice. Researchers found that nerolidol affected the hippocampus of mice, creating a sedative effect. Neither study involved humans, but some see these studies as an indication that nerolidol has powerful antifungal and sedative properties.
Myrcene
Myrcene is frequently the most abundant terpene in cannabis strains. It’s also the reason why certain strains may smell like cloves and hops. Research dating back to the 1990s seems to show that myrcene has sedative, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects. A study published in the Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology in 1990, for example, indicated that myrcene stimulated the release of endogenous opioids, creating powerful pain relieving effects in patients. In other words, myrcene encouraged your body to release its own pain relieving compounds. A follow-up study led researchers to believe that the pain-relieving benefits of myrcene were even more powerful, and that myrcene could be prescribed as an alternative type of pain medication for patients wanting to avoid the side effects of aspirin and other modern medicine. In a study from 2002, researchers found that myrcene could also promote muscle relaxation and sedation: mice that were given myrcene slept longer than the control mice, which is why some people take myrcene to enjoy a better sleep. A separate study disputed the idea that myrcene could act as an anti-depressant and stress reliever, however, despite its seemingly ‘calming’ properties. In another study, researchers also found that high dosages of myrcene were linked with increased symptoms of anxiety.
Menthol
Menthol is a well-known terpene inside and outside the cannabis community. Menthol is associated with a cooling sensation. There’s a reason why tobacco companies add menthol to certain cigarettes: the terpene has a proven ability to reduce irritation in your respiratory tract, and studies have shown that menthol reduces coughing. Critics claim adding menthol to cigarettes is a bad idea because it enables people to smoke more than they should. Menthol can also be found as a natural compound in cannabis, where it’s present in lower doses and can function as a natural anti-irritant – particularly for those prone to throat irritation or coughing. Studies have shown that menthol can increase the pain threshold of rats when applied topically. Because of its anti-nociceptive properties, some people apply menthol-heavy cannabis products topically to relieve pain.
Linalool
Linalool is naturally present in both cannabis and lavender plants. Studies have shown that linalool has sedative properties while also helping with anxiety, pain relief, and seizure management. In one 2002 study, researchers discovered that linalool reduced inflammation on rats. A follow-up study by the same team determined that linalool not only reduced inflammation, but it also displayed anti-nociceptive properties by reducing sensory pain. A 2010 study also found that linalool had a natural ability to decrease the frequency of seizures. Mice that received linalool at a certain dosage had longer times between seizures compared to control mice. Overall, linalool is a terpene linked with multiple powerful benefits ranging from anti-anxiety to pain relief to seizure management, although more studies need to be performed in humans to verify these benefits.
Limonene
Limonene is another terpene best-known outside of the cannabis community: high levels of limonene can be found in the rinds of citrus fruits like lemons and limes. Researchers have found powerful benefits linked with limonene as early as 1994, when researchers determined that limonene may inhibit the spread of cancer. Researchers gave limonene to patients with both early-stage and advanced-stage cancers and found that the terpene acted as a powerful anti-carcinogen. These anti-cancer effects have been repeatedly demonstrated in tests on pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. Aside from acting as an anti-carcinogen, limonene also has a proven ability as a powerful stress reducer and anti depressant, which is why many medical marijuana users seek limonene-heavy strains to help them relax. Finally, limonene has demonstrated an ability in several studies to reduce inflammation, particularly in patients with asthma or gastrointestinal issues.
Isopulegol
Isopulegol is a chemical precursor to menthol, although it’s been linked to many of its own unique benefits. In studies involving animals, researchers have found that isopulegol can reduce depression and anxiety by targeting the central nervous system, which is why many medical marijuana patients look for isopulegol-heavy strains to boost relaxation. In 2009, researchers published a study indicating that isopulegol could be used for seizure management: researchers found that mice given isopulegol experienced fewer seizures and were less likely to die from seizures. Researchers traced this benefit to isopulegol’s ability to modulate GABA receptors, which can also relieve stress and boost relaxation. Finally, isopulegol has also been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective properties in mice, reducing the risk of ulcers and other inflammation-related issues.
Humulene
Humulene is one of the few terpenes on this list linked with appetite suppression. Not only does humulene reduce pain and inflammation, but it can also encourage you to eat less. In 2007, researchers found that humulene had similar anti-inflammatory properties to modern medications like steroids. In 2008, researchers in Brazil reached similar conclusions by applying humulene topically, where humulene was shown offering powerful local relief from inflammation and pain. Soon after, researchers decided to study what happened when taking humulene orally. Again, the terpene proved to be surprisingly effective at reducing inflammation. In terms of appetite suppression, more research needs to be done on humulene before its ability to supress human appetite is confirmed, although many in the cannabis community swear by humulene’s ability to reduce appetite.
Guaiol
Guaiol is one of the least-studied terpenes on this list. Limited research has been performed on guaiol over the years. We know it’s an alcohol found naturally in the oil of the cypress pine and guaiacum. Some believe these plants release guaiol to keep away harmful insects and microbes: it may act as a type of natural insecticide and anti-microbial agent. In 2007, researchers found that guaiol did have some anti-bacterial effects against certain bacterial strains, although not against others. Researchers echoed these findings in 2013 by demonstrating that guaiol could act as a natural insecticide. Because of these findings, guaiol’s benefits may be more attractive to cannabis growers than cannabis users. However, more research continues to be done on this mysterious terpene.
Geranyl Acetate
If you have ever smelled cannabis that has a flowery or fruity scent, then it could be because of the geranyl acetate content. Geranyl acetate not only has a pleasant smell, but it also has powerful antimicrobial properties. A study published in Natural Product Research in 2011 showed that geranyl acetate had powerful antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. However, this study also used geranyl acetate as part of a combination with several other terpenes, making it difficult to conclusively say whether or not geranyl acetate could be used as an antifungal or antibacterial agent on its own. Ultimately, geranyl acetate may be one of the best-smelling terpenes on this list – but it’s also one of the least studied terpenes.
Geraniol
Geraniol, like geranyl acetate, is another great-smelling terpene. It smells like rose petals. But geraniol packs more than just a pleasant smell: it has also demonstrated proven anti-inflammatory abilities in multiple studies. A 2009 study revealed that geraniol can treat inflammatory lung disease, for example. Then, in 2011, researchers found that geraniol could relieve bacterial-induced inflammation in animal models – and it did so with fewer side effects than conventional medicine. Further studies have suggested that geraniol may be effective for treating inflammatory bowel disease and diet-induced fibrosis. Geraniol’s anti-inflammatory effects have been linked to its “free radical scavenging” properties. Unfortunately for those seeking the benefits of geraniol, it’s relatively hard to find among cannabis strains and is not considered a “primary” terpene of cannabis.
Eucalyptol (Cineol)
Eucalyptol, also known as cineol, has been linked to a diverse set of health benefits. In numerous studies over the years, eucalyptol has been linked to everything from pain and inflammation treatment to antifungal properties. In 2000, scientists discovered eucalyptol had powerful, natural anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it an effective type of pain and inflammation relief product. Follow-up studies indicated that eucalyptol was particularly effective at treating sinus inflammation (rhinosinusitis) and colon inflammation (colitis). Another study indicated eucalyptol could be used to treat pancreatitis. Asthma patients may be able to use eucalyptol to reduce airway inflammation and improve breathing, according to the results of one study. Eucalyptol is also one of the few terpenes on this list shown to reduce symptoms of Alzheimer’s: studies have shown eucalyptol can reduce inflammation in the brain (neuroinflammation) and inhibit the formation or spread of Alzheimer’s. As if these benefits weren’t enough, separate studies have indicated cineol has antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, and insecticide properties.
Cymene
In addition to being naturally present in cannabis, cymene can be found in both cumin and thyme. Limited studies have explored the health benefits of cymene. The studies that have explored the health benefits, however, have linked cymene with powerful anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Biosciences found that cymene significantly increased the time it took for mice to feel pain caused by heat and inflammation. A similar study in 2015 created similar results, suggesting that cymene reduced pain and inflammation by modulating the opioid system. Overall, there’s been insufficient research on cymene to definitively connect this terpene to major analgesic and anti-inflammatory benefits, although early research on the terpene has been largely positive.
Delta 3 Carene
Some people complain about dry mouth and dry eyes after consuming certain strains of cannabis. In many cases, these symptoms are caused by high levels of a terpene called delta 3 carene. This terpene has been shown to remove excess fluids from the body. This is likely why certain strains of cannabis cause dry mouth and dry eyes while other strains do not. Despite the unpleasantly dry sensation it creates, delta 3 carene has been linked to certain health benefits – particularly in patients using marijuana to manage symptoms of MS. Delta 3 carene has been shown to reduce inflammation and minimize joint pain in patients with multiple sclerosis. Overall, patients using marijuana recreationally may want to avoid strains with high levels of delta 3 carene, although the terpene can still be useful for its targeted health benefits. Delta 3 carene can give cannabis a sweet, earthy, pine-style aroma. In addition to being found in cannabis, delta 3 carene is used in cosmetics and perfumes. It can also act as a natural antihistamine in topical products.
Camphor
Have you ever used Vicks Vaporub? If so, then you’ve already used the terpene called camphor. It’s the main active ingredient in the product. Camphor has been used in medicine for hundreds of years for various health benefits. More recently, these health benefits have been successfully replicated in a number of studies. Applying camphor topically can create a cooling sensation that alleviates localized pain, for example. Studies have compared the pain and inflammation relieving benefits of camphor to capsaicin: camphor doesn’t provide the same powerful, natural pain relief as capsaicin but it does work more quickly than capsaicin. A 2014 study reinforced the topical pain and inflammation relief benefits of camphor, showing that patients who applied camphor directly to their skin improved blood circulation in their skin and muscle. It’s also important to note that camphor is the active ingredient in more than just Vicks Vaporub: it’s the active ingredient in many nasal decongestant medications. Interestingly, research hasn’t proven that camphor genuinely improves nasal airflow; instead, research shows that the cooling sensation of camphor simply tricks the body into feeling better nasal airflow. Another unique property of camphor is its ability to affect heart rate: studies indicate that taking camphor can create an abnormally rapid heart rate. Camphor has been linked with tachycardia, which is a fancy word for a rapid heart rate.
Camphene
Camphene is one of the most-studied terpenes on this list. However, it’s also surprisingly dangerous: the terpene is highly combustible and releases carcinogenic smoke when heated at a high enough temperature. That smoke not only gives you cancer, but it’s also very acrid and can irritate the lungs and the throat. The first major use of camphene was in the 1800s when people used it for lamp fuel. After several notable incidents involving lamp explosions, people decided camphene was no longer a safe source of lamp fuel. Today, research indicates that camphene is safe when kept at a stable temperature and can actually lead to some powerful health benefits. One study from 2009, for example, showed that camphene boosted cell viability, decreased lipid peroxidation, and improved mitochondrial membrane potential, all of which are fancy words for “it reduced inflammation”, particularly when treating inflammation caused by oxidative stress. In 2012, researchers found similar results using camphene dosages of 200 mg/kg. At this dose, mice were able to handle free radicals more effectively than control mice, suggesting that camphene has powerful antioxidant properties.

Overall, camphene may be the most dangerous terpene on this list when burned, but it has surprisingly powerful benefits when applied topically or as a tincture.

QFYGW82C6X,"Crisis Group urges 'dialogue' between Mali government, jihadists","Published on

									AFP									
								

Mali’s government should consider “dialogue” with jihadists waging an insurgency in the west African state, the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank suggested Tuesday, an idea promptly rejected by Bamako.
The idea of talking to jihadists may seem ludicrous to some, said the ICG, but insisted all avenues should be explored to protect civilians reeling from inter-communal violence in central Mali, fuelled by the Islamist revolt.

In a report, the ICG did not suggest halting military operations against Katiba Macina, the armed group of radical Islamist preacher Amadou Koufa behind a four-year-old insurgency.
But it recommended “a shift of tack, with force used alongside efforts to bring Katiba Macina leaders to the table”, adding that prospects of defeating the movement on the battlefield were “remote”.
However, a government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that “the official line… for the moment is not to discuss with them.”
This reflected a statement by Mali’s Foreign Minister Tiebile Drame, who told Radio France International on a visit to Paris last week: “The line of the Malian state is that there is no dialogue envisaged with those to whom you refer.”
The ICG report, entitled “Speaking with the ‘Bad Guys’: Towards dialogue with central Mali’s jihadists,” said previous contacts had “revealed a degree of pragmatism among Katiba Macina militants, suggesting that even if the odds are stacked against success, dialogue with the group is worth trying.”
An independent group that proposes solutions to conflicts, the ICG acknowledged the idea of talking with jihadists could outrage “some Bamako elites” and may be seen as a step toward a deal and Sharia rule.
Foreign powers, in turn, “might see it as legitimising a terrorist outfit with blood on its hands,” the report added.
However, “war between the state and jihadists in central Mali has led to growing intercommunal violence,” the ICG said. 
“To spare civilians additional harm, the government should explore the possibility of talks with the insurgents about local ceasefires and humanitarian aid.”
The government in Bamako “should empower religious leaders to explore initial talks” with jihadist leaders and also seek dialogue among central Malians, “including those sympathetic to the insurgency,” the report suggested.
– Fulani vs Dogon –
To make such talks more palatable to Malian authorities and Western allies such as France, which has intervened militarily to combat Islamists, jihadist forces should be compelled to renounce ties to transnational movements such as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
Delegates to a national conference in 2017 called for the opening of talks with Amadou Koufa and radical Tuareg leader Iyad Ag Ghaly, but the resolution was rejected by the Malian and French governments.
Amadou Koufa in March 2017 joined the newly-formed Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM), which was born of a merger to become the leading jihadist alliance in the Sahel region with links to Al-Qaeda. Iyad Ag Ghaly is its leader.
This group, Drame said last week, “has contributed to shedding a lot of blood, too much blood, these last years.”
Since the appearance of Koufa’s movement, recruited mainly among his own Fulani (Peul) community, communal violence has spread in central Mali, a mosaic of ethnic groups.
Fulani people, who are traditionally cattle-breeders, have confronted the Bambara and Dogon communities of settled farmers and hunters, who in turn have created “self-defence militias”.
In an explosion of violence on March 23, about 160 Fulani villagers were slaughtered at Ogossagou, near the border with Burkina Faso, by suspected Dogon hunters.
The UN mission in Mali (MINUSMA) announced on May 16 it had recorded “at least 488 deaths” since January 2018 in attacks by “traditional hunters against civilians of the Peul population” in the central Mopti and Segou regions.
Over the same period, armed Fulanis “caused 63 deaths” among civilians in the Mopti region, MINUSMA said.",https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/crisis-group-urges-dialogue-between-mali-government-jihadists-2/,EN,,28/05/2019 23:12,2019-05-28 14:46:52+00:00,c9593f6e51,www.journalducameroun.com,,,,,1559062012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EEC6V7UB1N,Debug your home before showing it,"Asian tiger mosquito
I hope everyone enjoyed the Memorial Day Weekend with family and friends and remembered those who, over the last 242 years of our existence, sacrificed for our democracy and freedom. I also hope there will be fewer wars and more diplomacy and communication to solve disagreements and issues.
When you or your agents are showing your home, do you worry about insects in and outside your home this summer? With all the rain we have had during the winter and spring and may continue to have going forward, mosquitoes and other annoying flying insects could be a real pain in the butt, a hazard and and a turn-off to your purchasers, assuming you have a very pleasant rear yard to relax in.
Standing water is a huge breeding ground for those pesky litter critters as well as their potential dangerous bites and itchy aftermath. The last thing you need is to have your buyers bitten and become irked when viewing your backyard. Any time it rains, make sure all those pans, buckets or whatever you may have that collects rain water are dumped out and turned over, so water accumulation is eliminated. Also, the closer you are to lakes, oceans or swampy low-lying areas, the greater the opportunity for mosquito infestation.
Nassau and Suffolk counties and  state-owned properties have many areas, especially recharge basins where water sits and accumulates as a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes. You can reach out to the public works and health department in your county to ascertain if they will be spraying larvicide to kill the mosquito eggs before they hatch in those areas again this summer. West Nile Virus is directly related to infected Asian Tiger mosquitoes that carry the disease. Last year Nassau and Suffolk counties had reported cases, including some that were fatal.
So one should cover arms and legs, especially in areas with mosquitoes and be cognizant of any bites that cause mild symptoms of fever, headache and body aches, a skin rash and swollen lymph glands. Symptoms in more severe cases can include high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis. Individuals most at risk for severe infection include those over the age of 55 and those with chronic illness or compromised immune systems.
Deer ticks, which cause Lyme Disease, is another serious issue in Long Island, especially where tall grasses and vegetation exist. One should always wear clothing to cover arms and legs when walking or hiking, especially in Suffolk County. Flea bites are another insect, although much less dangerous, but annoying, which your pets should be protected against. Here is a link to assist in your search for natural remedies for your pets: https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/natural-solutions-tick-season/
As the warm humid and hot weather becomes the norm, homeowners themselves don’t need any of those issues to cause buyers not to consider your home. I have seen many homes over the years, where the homeowner goes out and purchases bug zappers. It may appear that you are reducing the population of all sorts of flying insects, including mosquitoes, but I beg to differ and the reason is that the light that attracts them does just that, and you are just attracting a greater population of insects to your property.
Citronella drives away bothersome insects such as flies and mosquitoes. You can combat the bugs further by also combining the torches with citrus candles for twice the pest-fighting action.
Spray water with lavender or eucalyptus around your patio to create a natural pest barrier. Spraying it on you can also help keep bugs away. Vinegar is a natural deterrent for ants. A combination of half apple cider vinegar (although normal vinegar works just as well) and half water in a spray bottle works perfectly to repel those pests. This concoction can be sprayed around the perimeter of your home, on the legs of tables that have food served on them or even around a screen house or tent. While vinegar is an effective item you can use to get rid of ants, you will need to reapply, as the residual effect is minimal.
Another useful ant deterrent is cayenne pepper. When sprinkled in places where ants tend to gather, like areas near sugar and places where crumbs linger, they stay away. The pepper’s spice serves as a deterrent for the ants by telling them that none of the sweet stuff that they’re looking for is there. It acts almost like caution tape. It can get a little messy, so try to sprinkle the cayenne pepper in areas that aren’t used as much, like a cabinet, especially ones that contain baking supplies or other sweet goods.
Another natural deterrent is peppermint oil. Not only does it repel ants, it also repels spiders. In fact, peppermint keeps most pests away, including aphids, beetles, caterpillars, fleas, flies, lice, mice and moths. There are three ways to effectively apply this oil: soaking cotton balls in the oil and hiding them where the insects gather, applying the oil directly to the affected areas, or diluting it with water and spraying the perimeter of areas you’re trying to protect. If you’re diluting the oil, mix 10 drops of peppermint essential oil and 16 oz. of water, then pour into a spray bottle. Peppermint oil can also keep some of the spiders out of the areas of the home where they frequent most, in addition to making the house smell wonderful. While this appears to be a simple solution, it’s a game of strategy by putting the oil in locations where you suspect pests are entering. With a little trial and error, you should be able to target and focus on those specific areas. It’s all about where you put it, using doorways and entrances to your advantage.
Getting rid of crickets in your basement can be done in two ways. Fill a bowl with a few tablespoons of molasses and then fill half way up with water and place in those areas in your basement where you notice the populations of crickets. As they get attracted to the molasses and go in and get stuck and then drown, replace as needed. Also, sticky traps work extremely well, too, and are another natural way to minimize them. There are also cricket bait you can purchase that will work too.
Finding natural solutions for keeping away mosquitoes is always a challenging process. Using a mixture of lavender oil and eucalyptus oil can help keep them away and heal any existing bites. The mixture has a nice fragrant smell compared to most cans of spray you can buy in the store, and it’s as affordable as a bottle of DEET, which you should use as a last resort. But be careful and use precaution and ask your doctor for advice before using.
Lavender oil is one of the only essential oils you don’t have to dilute with water to use on the body, although it’s recommended that you speak with your doctor first. All in all, these bug deterrents all do their jobs well, and finding some natural options for your household and family is always a plus.
Lastly, here are some choices in plants that you can grow or purchase to strategically place around your home where you know previous issues with mosquitoes existed or might be:
1.) Citronella grass
2.) Basil
3.) Catnip
4.) Catmint
5.) Rosemary and thyme, which lasted longer than DEET as per Seoul National University, in Seoul, Korea.
6.)

You can call your local exterminator, if you don’t want to bother doing it yourself, but the natural way is always safer and you’ll save money and have potentially less issues with your children and pets.
Eliminating unwanted insects inside and outside your home will add to the desirability of your home and property, while keeping buyers in the game when viewing your home for sale or rent and will add to maximizing its appeal.

OX2NOE8XXK,Daily soaps: Lacking sanity,"Illustration by Marium Ali

 
I am back. With a vengeance. Teeth sharpened, claws twitching like a cat about to devour a recently mutilated mouse. It has been torturous watching the scenes which shall be placed on the slaughtering block and chopped up, frame by frame, deconstructed, dismantled and disembowelled for the deeper meaning inherent in what otherwise appears to be nothing but a poorly conceived and executed attempt to entertain the viewing masses. 
When I set out to analyse the fare that is being produced and aired in the name of entertainment, I had only a vague idea how insidious the design of this industry could be, how dangerous the kinds of notions that form the foundation of the scripts that are acted out, literally, by men and women who may just be doing what seems to be a ‘job’. 
Is it possible that the damage inherent in the roles and scenarios being played out escapes the entire production team? Can an actor actually take on a character without analysing the significance of the dialogue, the narrative, the denouement of the entire plot line? Apparently, all of this is possible. Apparently, there is no need to consider the implausibility of certain events or to reconsider the retrogressive nature of certain cultural notions that reinforce already existing values that are neither just nor desirable. 
Let us begin with addressing the issue of sanity and its lack thereof. In the soaps viewed, more than just a few appear to base their ‘drama’ on the madness of the potential heroine: this can be an unwed young woman, a married young woman, a childless young woman, or a recently divorced young woman. The common factor shared by this rich variety of characters is that they are deeply, irretrievably unhappy and, not to overstate this, that they are young. 
They are also usually fair complexioned, reasonably pleasant looking, with hair the colour of a Makrani sunset. They are usually totally powerless; they haven’t got a college degree; they do not work; and they have no ambition to do anything other than get married, have children and attend to the whims and fancies of husbands, mothers-in-law and sundry neighbours who breeze in and out of bedrooms, lounges, kitchens and courtyards, with nothing to do other than enquire about the unwed daughter, the married one, the childless one and, of course, in conspiratorial whispers, the divorced one. 
Now, the various reasons the aforementioned young women are rendered insane present themselves as follows: the unwed daughter has lost it since she has not received the right marriage proposal; the married one has stopped speaking since she has married the wrong man; the childless woman weeps endlessly, copious glycerine tears pouring out of mascaraed eyes, endlessly berated for being barren; and the divorced woman stares at walls uselessly for she is just a used good, a burden on her parents and hard-working or, alternately, jobless brothers. 
A divorced woman is a shunned woman so her madness does not really count. She must have been mad to start with and that could be the reason why she was not able to keep a marriage going, despite having married the wrong man, of course. No sympathy for such marital miscalculations! The strange behaviour of the unwed girl, the wrongly married girl and the childless girl with a womb as vacant as the look in her eyes, however, is something that needs redressal. 
In families across the country, supposedly depicted in the plethora of soaps being broadcasted night and ceaseless day, young girls are seen sitting or lying down on beds, doing nothing, sitting on sofas with golden frames and lurid upholstery to make up for the vapid conversation and insipid histrionics, or they are opening gates for milkmen, vegetable vendors or total strangers who happen to form a link to the riveting happenings which shall unfold scene after painful scene. 
Therefore, given that these young women have absolutely nothing else to do other than lounge around like lizards sunbathing on a rock, it should certainly not come as a surprise when one of them stops talking or starts staring at unseen things on walls littered haphazardly with calendars several years too old, clocks whose hands do not move and pictures of cats and babies, and red roses growing in some distant garden (a metaphor for kittens and babies growing in a distant womb, clearly). 
The very fact that these frail, jobless, sad yet meticulously made over characters display symptoms which are not very hard to distinguish from the daily pattern of their behaviour speaks volumes for the deviousness of the minds responsible for churning out script after vacuous script. Once the non-symptoms of supposed madness have been detected and acknowledged, usually through a protracted process of pointless and rhetorical question asking (‘kya ho gaya hai bitya ko?’), the responsible adults in the young girl’s family make a beeline for the mysterious yet familiar environs of dubious men who claim to have the solution up their sleeve, or in the pot, so to speak. Instead of consulting a doctor or even the local midwife (who has knowledge about ‘wombs with no view’ that would make the most competent obstetrician or gynaecologist blush with shame), the local aamil or pir baba is sought out. 
The journey to his abode is a harrowing one — through narrow lanes and eerie, fog-filled courtyards leading to an ‘astaana’ marked with strange symbols evocative of the intriguing spiral which serves as a symbol of the White Walkers in Game of Thrones. 
We step inside the pir baba’s workplace for that is what it is, a fully equipped office of sorts, complete with dead goats’ heads, severed hands of babies, bloodied chicken feathers, plastic skulls, a scatter of pins and needles, and lots and lots of green chillies and lemons, enough to make up a nice garnishing on a baara masaalay ki chaat. The place is ill-lit, except for a rush of HMI light filtering through a ventilator placed in a wall opposite the throne of the said pir baba. 
The light hits the pir baba’s bearded face. His eyes are hooded, his mouth chanting a mumbled mantra. His neck is weighed down by a flood of beaded garlands and he wears a long, loose garment, as green as a field of alfalfa on a sunny day. The pir baba has clearly not been to a barbershop in a long while; he shakes his tresses from side to side as the said sad-mad (young) woman is brought into the room by the said (responsible) adult member of her family. 
Standing besides the pir baba is the Loyal Minion, the Assistant Director, Exorcism Branch of Retrogressive Ville, if you will. He is usually a slight man, not portly like his Master of Magical Ability. The assistant is poorly dressed, bereft of jewellery or any finery, and he squats or stands with gaze lowered, ready to strike if things get out of hand. And things do get out of hand as the satanic manifestation that has gotten a hold of the said sad-mad (young) woman reaches a fever pitch, with the pir baba shaking a lance or a jharroo at the said sad-mad woman, screaming horrific invective at the devil, urging the non-rent-paying shaitan to leave the body it has possessed or else there will be more shaking and shouting, and general pandemonium.
The script can veer into different directions at this point: an intervention takes place while the sad-mad maiden is being supposedly beaten to within an inch of her otherwise living-dead state. Sometimes it is a portly, stout, white-haired grandmother who finds her way through the labyrinth of narrow lanes and alleyways, not daunted by the creeping fog (smoke machines have a special place in the world of make-believe), determined to find the lost, sad-mad and soon-to-be-glad girl. 
At other times it is a young man who steps in between the pir baba’s jharroo and the supposedly possessed but nubile body of the sad-mad-and-not-yet-glad young woman. In the former case, the grandmother falls at the feet of the enraged pir baba (the rage comes from the fact that the shaitan has illegally occupied a rather attractive accommodation). She wails and pleads and beseeches the Whipping Weirdo to spare her granddaughter. But the Whipping Weirdo is committed to the exorcism and continues to flagellate the young -sad-mad-and-not-yet-glad woman. The minion (Assistant Director, Ministry of Total Buffoonery) aids and abets his master by shouting ‘Haq Allah! Sach Allah, Baqi sab Jhoooth!’ until the young-sad-mad-and-not-yet-glad woman swoons and falls into a lifeless heap on the chilli and lemon festooned floor of the said voodoo venue. 
Of course, the fact that she is usually equally lifeless while draped over a bed or slumbering on a sofa escapes the writer, director, producer and audience. In fact, the only time that said character actually comes to life is when she is mall crawling or merrily dancing at her best friend’s henna ceremony. Once the exorcism is over, the pir baba retires to his shady corner while the assistant director minion presses his master’s legs or ushers out the grateful grandmother/young, unknown stranger man/the possessed woman and perhaps the rickshaw driver who appears out of the blue into said shady lane.
This then, is the method to the madness of the young-sad-mad-and-not-yet-glad woman. As the sun rises over the horizon the next day, we will know for sure that the coveted rishta has come, that the estranged husband has returned, that the longed-for child will blossom in the hitherto empty womb. And back at the astaana of the Whipping Weirdo, more goat heads and chicken feathers vie for space on the cold brick floor, nestling themselves comfortably in the imagination of an audience hanging off its bed/golden sofa/garden chair, waiting for the next episode of straining moments of the weak.

E8MBBWQKTT,Bob Weir Profile: The Grateful Dead Guitarist Will Not Rest,"For all of the lingering association of the Grateful Dead with acid, Weir says he never liked tripping all that much. “It was pretty scary for me. It opened me up to stuff I just wasn't ready for,” he says. “LSD was something of a calling for us, but I think we tended to make more of it than it really amounted to. Being profoundly disoriented in concert with a bunch of my cohorts was a grand little adventure, but we were on an adventure anyway. The fact that we were together, and we were making music, making art, and creating a new, a fresh way of looking at the world, was much more important and much more central to what we were up to than any kind of medication.” The last times he took acid willingly, he says, were way back in 1966, willingly being an important qualifier because for years afterward, he says, “it was everybody's favorite sport to try and dose Bobby.” (“Everybody was dosing everybody!” Mickey Hart helpfully clarifies.)In reality, cocaine and heroin were the dominant drugs for most of the Grateful Dead's history. Weir tried heroin with Garcia, but it somehow failed to sink its teeth into Weir in the same way it did his friend. “I've wondered about that a lot: How come this bullet with his name on it wasn't a bullet with my name on it?” he says. “We weren't that different. But I guess I knew that, like with this pain in my back, I was going to beat it. I'm an optimist, and I'm not sure Jerry was all that optimistic.”In New Orleans, Weir had told me a story to illustrate how, by the end, addiction and the pressures of fame had conspired to shrink Garcia's life.“One time we came here after a long absence, and our publicist, who was also a good friend, asked Jerry how was it getting back to New Orleans, because it's such a great music town,” he said. “Jerry's answer was, ‘Well, one hotel's the same as another.’ That was pretty much the life he was given.”We sat there for a few moments, listening to the bus's air-conditioning hum, sunlight peeking in around the edges of the blackout curtains.“Yeah, well,” Weir said dryly, “I don't get out much, either.”“I don't much like travel,” he says later. “It's endurable.” At TRI Studios, his “spaceship” of a recording headquarters in Marin County, he pioneered webcasting live performances, which seemed like a stab at finding a way to perform without hitting the road—though it proved ahead of its time. He concedes that a more sedentary life would make it easier to pursue the many other projects vying for his attention, but playing live is, for him, non-negotiable: “That's the gig. That's what I'm here for. I'm here to light people up.”One morning I meet Weir in his Nashville hotel suite. There are three guitars leaning against a wall in the living area, a cowboy hat and a serape flung across a chair. Last night he had an initial songwriting meeting with the great John Prine, a get-acquainted session, and this afternoon the two are getting together again to hopefully write some material for Weir to take into the studio with Wolf Bros.In preparation, he wants to go through a folder he keeps on his phone containing bits and pieces—“shards,” he calls them—of musical inspiration. “These won't mean anything to anybody but me,” he says apologetically. There are bits of strumming, fragments of Wolf Bros jams and sound checks, a few seconds of humming here, a short burst of jazz recorded from the radio there. Weir listens with his head cocked, holding his guitar but not playing, except for walking one index finger up the frets—ever so gently pressing on each pearlescent dot—in time with what he's hearing.",https://www.gq.com/story/bob-weir-grateful-dead-profile,EN,,29/05/2019 00:22,2019-05-28 10:16:08+00:00,51fe179e08,www.gq.com,,,,,1559045768,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IJWQ3R6Y3L,Why Don’t We Hear About More Species Going Extinct?,"We’ve been hearing it for years: The world is in the midst of a biodiversity crisis, with species going extinct at a rate 1,000 times faster because of human impact on the environment.
Most recently a report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services estimated that as many as a million species risk extinction in the coming decades due to human-related activities.
All of which raises the question: If so many species are going extinct, why don’t we hear about new extinctions every day?
The answer to that question is more complex than you might think.
1. It Takes Time
Once in a while, the last known individual of a species dies while on display in a zoo or other institution — for example, Martha the passenger pigeon or Toughie the last Rabbs’ tree frog.  But in the vast majority of cases, the existence of the final representative of a species — the “endling” — is unknown. The norm is a species disappearing in the wild, one by one, far from human eyes. No one witnesses it die out. It declines silently until one day it’s just…gone.
And when that happens, it’s not easy for researchers to show that a species has vanished forever.
“Proving the negative is always impossible. Getting close to the demonstration that something must not exist anymore requires a lot of effort,” says H. Resit Akçakaya, professor of ecology and evolution at Stony Brook University. “It’s not sufficient to say that we didn’t see it. You need to have searched for it. Because that takes a lot of time and effort, usually species are not listed as extinct until long after they have actually gone extinct, or we think they were extinct, because we can never know, except for a very few exceptions.”
You’ll find examples of this when searching through the listings on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, which details the extinction risk for about 98,500 species. Many listings for rare species include the last time that particular plant or animal was observed by scientists, and that date is often decades in the past.
Take, for example, a Hawaiian bird known as the poʻouli (Melamprosops phaeosoma). The IUCN lists the species as “critically endangered (possibly extinct).” The bird hasn’t been seen in the wild since 2004, but it still hasn’t been moved into the “extinct” category. Right now there are 68 other species in that “possibly extinct” category. Hundreds more are still listed as “critically endangered” despite a lack of recent sightings.
The Endangered Species Act takes its time, too. For example, the Eastern cougar (Puma concolor couguar) was removed from the endangered species list last year, 80 years after its last confirmed sighting. Biologists spent decades looking for signs of the animal before confirming its extinction.
Biologist Bruce Wright poses with the body of the last known eastern cougar in 1938. USFWS
“We in the conservation field never want to wipe a species off the books until it’s really absolutely solidly, solidly positively dead, dead, dead,” explains Stuart Pimm, the Doris Duke professor of conservation ecology at Duke University and the founder of SavingSpecies. That’s a slow process. “For a long time, there was a rule that said it has to have been unseen for 50 years before you could declare it extinct.”
There are other criteria for declaring a species extinct. For example, a 2005 paper by Stuart Butchart and other conservation experts identified several types of evidence to be used before a species could be considered “possibly extinct.” From the paper:

The species’ population decline must be well documented.
It must face “severe threatening processes” such as habitat loss or intensive hunting.
It must possess attributes known to predispose similar species to extinction, such as a small range or inability to migrate.
And surveys have failed to detect it, with due consideration given to how easy or hard it is to observe the species.

Similarly, the paper considers four types of evidence against extinction:

Surveys to find the species have been inadequate, perhaps because they were at the wrong time of year or the species lives in hard-to-reach areas.
The species is difficult to see, hear or otherwise detect.
It’s been reasonably sighted by locals, even if those sightings are unconfirmed.
And suitable habitat still exists.

With all of this in mind, it’s likely we’ve lost a lot of species over the past few decades, but scientists are hesitant to formally shift them into the “extinct” category quite yet.
There’s an important reason for that.
2. Mistakes are Costly
“There are costs associated with listing a species as extinct, so biologists, understandably, don’t want to declare a species extinct before they are pretty certain,” says Akçakaya.
The biggest cost: Declaring a species extinct too early can actually lead to its extinction.
That’s called the “Romeo Error,” named after Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet.” In the play, lovestruck Romeo mistakenly thinks his beloved Juliet is dead, so he takes his own life. That’s not exactly how it would play out in the wild, but when humans incorrectly think a species is extinct when it’s not, the error can lead to the removal of any legal protections for the species or its habitat. That means if the species is later rediscovered, protective measures have to start over at step one — assuming there’s anything left to save at that point.
One of the most well-known cases of the Romeo Error took place in the Philippines, where the island of Cebu experienced so much deforestation that several of its native species were declared extinct early in the 20th century. That included a bird called the Cebu flowerpecker (Dicaeum quadricolor), which was later rediscovered in 1992 in a tiny fragment of remaining forest. Today the bird is still critically endangered, but its populations could have been much healthier if efforts to protect it had not been abandoned decades earlier.
Of course, to experience the Romeo Error, you need a Romeo (or a Juliet) in the first place.
In other words, you need a name.
3. You Can’t Declare Extinct What You Don’t Know
The world has about 1.7 million described species. Many scientists estimate the total level of biodiversity on the planet at about 8 million, while others say it’s much higher. That means there are a lot of species yet to be identified, named, studied or assessed for their extinction risk.
“Most of the species we know must exist are not yet described,” says Akçakaya. “Since we don’t know most of the species that exist, we don’t know most of the species that are going extinct.”
We find out about some of these unnamed extinctions after the fact — sometimes long after. Two of the four extinctions I’ve reported on so far this year were species that disappeared decades ago but have only just been scientifically identified and named.
But those species were only identified because museums had samples in their collections. Otherwise no one might have noticed that they were gone, let alone known if they had lived at all. We find out about dinosaurs and other extinct prehistoric species through fossil evidence, but most plants and animals degrade and decompose pretty quickly after they die, leaving few signs that they ever existed.
It’s difficult to estimate the numbers of these unknown species, but we do know how many can exist inside intact habitats, and how many rely upon incredibly small, specific microhabitats. And we know that when those habitats disappear, so does what lived in them.
Even for species we’ve identified, we can’t assess their extinction risk if we don’t know much about them. The IUCN Red List includes about 15,000 species in a category called “data deficient” — in other words, we don’t know if they’re at risk or not, or even if they still exist. A 2016 paper by biologist Chris Parsons argued that all of these “data-deficient” species, which are often hard to find and study, should be considered “assumed threatened,”  a step that would encourage policymakers to treat them as at risk rather than just “out of sight, out of mind.”
The same could probably be said for the hundreds of thousands of identified species that haven’t even made it to the IUCN Red List.
4. The Last Reason We Don’t Announce Many Extinctions: Successes
The Cebu flowerpecker, like so many other critically endangered species, continues to survive. Much as humans are to blame for so many extinctions, we’re also to be credited for helping to prevent some of these species from disappearing altogether.
For examples, look at the California condor, black-footed ferret and Mexican gray wolf. These are just a few of the species that humans nearly drove extinct that have since been saved due to modern and ever-improving conservation techniques.

“When we do find species that are hanging on by their toenails, we are in a better position to save those species from the brink of extinction,” says Pimm. “People find them and they can begin to bring them back.”
These species don’t always bounce back to safe levels, but avoiding extinction is still an achievement. “If a species is critically endangered, and has been critically endangered for the last 20 years, is that a conservation success?” asks Akçakaya. “Perhaps it is, if we can demonstrate that without conservation it would have gone extinct 10 years ago.”
Of course, saving a species requires finding out that it’s endangered early enough to do something about it — not to mention finding the last individuals. “Finding three individuals is not going to get you much,” says Pimm. “The best you can hope for is a male and a female, and there’s a possibility you’ll find that all three are male.”
That, it turns out, is another reason why some species haven’t been declared extinct yet — they’re alive, but unlikely to persist. The most notable example is the northern white rhino, which has just two females left in the world. The species still exists, but for all intents and purposes, it’s a walking case of extinction.
Given all of this, we know that many more species are going extinct than get reported. But how do we know how many are going extinct? We’ll address that question in part II of this article, coming soon.

QP4759C9FZ,"PH eagles get special treatment on PAL flights, are given passports by DFA","PH eagles get special treatment on PAL flights, are given passports by DFA 

Published June 4, 2019, 7:21 PM 

By Ariel Fernandez 
Philippine Airlines ( PAL ) is flying two Philippine eagles from their sanctuary in Davao to Singapore, via Manila, as part of the first international Philippine Eagle Loan Agreement between the governments of the Philippines, through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR ) and Singapore, through Wildlife Reserves Singapore ( WRS ). 
Philippine Eagle Foundation ( PEF ) Executive Director Dennis Salvador said, the two eagles will have special accommodations and were even given special passports by the Department of Foreign Affairs ( DFA ). 
Geothermica, 15-year old male, and Sambisig, 17-year old female, is being loaned to WRS to hopefully encourage breeding while in Singapore's Jurong Bird Park, one of the zoological facilities managed by WRS. 
The PEF hopes that through the eagle loan program, the WRS can help secure a gene pool of the Philippine eagles for species conservation and as insurance against natural calamities that can wipe out the only captive Philippine Eagle population at the Philippine Eagle Center ( PEC ) in Malagos, Davao City. T 
he PEF manages the PEC where both Geothermica and Sambisig were hatched and reared. 
The preserved gene pool can also be critical in preservation efforts in case of health epidemics like the avian flu. 
Many of PEF's eagles at the bird sanctuary have corporate sponsors: Geothermica is sponsored by Energy Development Corporation, while Sambisig is supported by Dow Chemical Philippines. PAL is a sponsor to another eagle named Sinag. 
`` Through the PAL Foundation, we are flying the loaned eagles to Singapore because we firmly believe in the eagle preservation advocacy of the PEF, '' said Jaime J. Bautista, PAL President, and PEF Vice Chairman. 
According to the PEF, Geothermica and Sambisig are at their prime for breeding. They were previously paired with other eagles at the Center, but these attempts did not progress to natural pairing. Captive-bred eagles are said to be more resilient than those from the wild. 
Meanwhile, the WRS, one of the world's leading zoological institutions, has been supporting conservation efforts across Southeast Asia through wildlife research and awareness campaigns with over 50 wildlife conservation projects. 
While PAL has a long experience in flying animals, this is the first time a critically endangered species is receiving special treatment as Geothermica and Sambisig fly on the Davao-Manila ( PR2808 ) and Manila-Singapore ( PR507 ) PAL flights",https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/06/04/ph-eagles-get-special-treatment-on-pal-flights-are-given-passports-by-dfa/,EN,,05/06/2019 01:37,2019-06-04 09:21:34+00:00,10c8057870,news.mb.com.ph,,,,,1559647294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

XOZ0BEPSOV,‘Pigageddon’ sees Chinese pork prices surge,"` Pigageddon ' sees Chinese pork prices surge 
Hog hell forced up retail inflation in China last month as pork prices surged by 18 % on the back of an African swine fever epidemic in the world's second-largest economy. 
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, hit 2.7 % in May, the highest level in more than a year. 
Overall food prices jumped by 7.7 % last month compared to the same period in 2018. 
Crop failure due to unseasonal weather also hit fresh fruit stocks with costs soaring by 26.7 % from 14.8 % in April. 
`` While Chinese diners, who account for half of the world's pork consumption, may get upset about higher prices, the development is not a something that would cause wider market panic, '' Bo Zhuang, the chief China economist at TS Lombard, told CNBC news. 
`` Pork prices have been on a roller-coaster for the last decade, '' Zhuang added. 
Domestic demand 
As for the broader producer price index, or PPI, it edged lower at 0.6 % in May from 0.9 % compared to the previous month. 
Recognized as an important indicator of domestic demand, analysts at Nomura reported that economic `` growth could slow further on escalating US-China trade tensions. '' 
`` We expect Beijing to undertake further easing [ or ] stimulus measures to bolster confidence and to stabilize growth, '' they added in a note. 
Still, it was the rise in pork prices which grabbed the headlines. 

Up to 200 million pigs could die, or be culled, in China this year after contracting African swine fever. 
If that happens, pork prices could soar by 70 %, according to a senior Chinese official who declined to be named. 
In March, a report by Nomura backed up that assessment. The Japanese bank warned that prices could rise to 33 yuan ( US$ 4.90 ) per kilogram by January 2020 from February's figure of 18.5 yuan-per-kilogram. That would represent a 78 % price hike. 
`` Despite the rise in pork prices, pig farmers may be reluctant to increase hog stocks on concerns about [ African swine fever ], '' Nomura's analysts said in the study. 
`` In this regard, the upturn of the hog cycle could last longer and drive pork prices higher than in previous hog cycles, '' they added. 
Highly contagious 
Reports about the highly-contagious virus have been sketchy in China's state-run media for fear of triggering panic buying. Even the official statistics are vague. 
In April, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs confirmed that China's sow population had plunged 21 % in March compared to the same period in 2019. 
But detailed numbers were missing from the statement. 
`` Second quarter [ pork production ] will see a marked drop from the first quarter, and the third quarter could be even bigger, '' Feng Yonghui, the chief analyst at industry website Soozhu.com, told Reuters. 
The full impact of African swine fever in the pig industry was first highlighted in a report by the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization's Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific. `` [ There is a ] major threat to the swine industry in China and to the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and others along the value chain, '' the study stated. 
`` Because pork is produced and consumed by so many Asian countries, particularly in East and Southeast Asia, the introduction of the virus to other countries of the region is a near certainty, '' it added. `` In its most virulent strain, it is 100 % fatal to infected pigs. However, unlike swine flu, ASF [ African swine fever ] poses no direct health threat to humans. '' 
The depth of the crisis was also highlighted in a study by Rabobank, which predicted that the ASF virus could wipe out between 150 million and 200 million pigs in China. 
Fallout from mass infections would result in a 30 % drop in pork production, it said. 
Back in November, China's Agriculture Ministry rolled out stringent hygiene measures in an effort to halt the spread of ASF. 
At least 18 provinces were reported to be affected, resulting in the death of 200,000 pigs -- a figure which analysts believe is just the tip of the iceberg. 
Officially, China's hog population has declined by 10.1 % to 375.25 million animals. 
Food chain 
Considered a staple in the food chain, further dramatic increases would set off alarm bells in Beijing, as the country celebrates 70 years of Communist Party rule later this year. 
`` The key question ... is what is the true severity of China's African Swine Fever outbreak? And, actually, no one, not even Beijing, knows the answer, '' Rory Green, an economist at TS Lombard, said. 
But then, China is not the only country hit by the ASF virus. 
The deadly disease has also broken out in Vietnam and Cambodia, while there are concerns it could spread to Thailand. 
`` Based on the commonalities with Chinese production, we expect these markets to suffer sizeable ASF herd losses [ on a percentage basis ] and experience similar difficulties in disease containment, '' the Rabobank report pointed out. 
`` Much of Southeast Asia will have difficulty repopulating its [ stocks ] and securing provisional protein supplies. ASF losses in Southeast Asia will exacerbate global protein shortfalls, adding further upside pressure to global markets, '' it added. 
For China, pork prices could rise considerably in the second half of the year unless ` pigageddon ' can be contained.",https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/06/article/pigageddon-sees-chinese-pork-prices-surge/,EN,,13/06/2019 01:25,2019-06-12 07:11:24+00:00,7b34ef8790,www.asiatimes.com,,,,,1560330684,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LFH3W0N7TA,China inflation hits highest level in 15 months,"China inflation hits highest level in 15 months 
Inflation in China rose to its highest level in more than a year in May driven by surges in pork and fruit prices caused by the African swine fever epidemic and bad weather, official data have shown. But while prices are increasing, demand remains weak because of the trade war with the United States and economic uncertainty. The consumer price index ( CPI ) -- a key gauge of retail inflation -- hit 2.7 per cent, the National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) said, compared with 2.5 per cent in April and the highest since February 2018. The data was in line with a forecast of analysts polled by Bloomberg News. The rise was `` largely the result of renewed acceleration in food price inflation '', and pork supply disruptions caused by African swine fever, Capital Economics said in a note. Millions of pigs have been culled recently as the disease cuts through China and beyond, devastating global food chains and impacting pork prices from the food markets of Hong Kong to US dinner tables. The price of pork soared 18.2 per cent in May, China's NBS said. The price of fresh fruit on-year was up 26.7 per cent as bad weather hammered supplies. Beijing's official statistics say around one million pigs have been killed since the first outbreak in August -- but that is widely considered to be an underestimate. The producer price index ( PPI ), an important indicator of domestic demand, hit 0.6 per cent in May, from 0.9 per cent the previous month. Economic `` growth could slow further on escalating US-China trade tensions '', Nomura International said in a note. `` We expect Beijing to undertake further easing/stimulus measures to bolster confidence and to stabilise growth. '' US President Donald Trump is expected to meet China's Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Japan this month to discuss the long-running trade row, but US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has warned that it will not be a stage for a `` definitive agreement ''.",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/china-inflation-hits-highest-level-in-15-months/article27854182.ece,EN,,13/06/2019 01:20,2019-06-12 07:08:31+00:00,3c4acf1de1,www.thehindubusinessline.com,,,,,1560330511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
